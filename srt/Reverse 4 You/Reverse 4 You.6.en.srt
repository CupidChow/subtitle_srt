1
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,440
Four, what are you doing?

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Wa…

3
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm so sorry.

4
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm sorry that I'm the reason Vivi's gone.

5
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Yum! Auntie must be in a good mood today.

6
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,600
She gave me extra pork.

7
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,080
Are you okay, Wa?

8
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,760
I told you that
her vermicelli tasted weird.

9
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,160
Do You want to try mine? I'll share.

10
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Hey! It's okay. Don't worry.

11
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm just not feeling like eating today.

12
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Or are you excited about
going on a date with Four today?

13
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,920
Vivi, whenever you have your visions,

14
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,160
do you have them in your dreams too?

15
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Not really.

16
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,840
Maybe I did.

17
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,920
I usually forget about them
when I wake up.

18
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,520
Hey, did you dream about something
and thought that it was a vision?

19
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm sorry to tell you
that this is my special ability.

20
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,760
It cannot be copied.

21
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,240
So… what about your future?

22
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,920
Can you share it with me?

23
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Why do you ask?

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
Well, you usually tell me about my future,

25
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,200
but you rarely share yours.

26
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,560
Or you haven't seen it?

27
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,800
Here it is, my future.

28
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,279
I want to be a famous illustrator,

29
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,920
so we can have enough money
to buy back our father's house.

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
And here.

31
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,800
I will always be your third-wheel forever.

32
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,720
Hey, is that me?

33
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,640
Yes.

34
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,280
Why is my hair like that?

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
And here is Four.

36
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,160
Hey, not bad for an artist.

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,440
Of course. Isn't it cute?

38
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,600
When you're done with homework,
come join me at the mall.

39
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,040
Why do you want me on your date?

40
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
It's not really a date.

41
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,760
We'll wait for Four right here.

42
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Wait! Aren't you guys
going out this evening?

43
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Nope.

44
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,960
Why did you take me out to lunch
if you're going on a date this afternoon?

45
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Well, I didn't want Four to buy me lunch.

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,320
Come on! Four's really rich.

47
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,960
Let her treat you food.

48
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,280
What? A couple
should help each other pay.

49
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,440
Fine. Whatever you say,
the defender of justice.

50
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,000
So are you going
to avoid eating with Four forever?

51
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
Just this period.

52
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,360
I have a lot of expenses.

53
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
Because my birthday is coming up?
September 21st.

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,560
What are you getting me?

55
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,160
I didn't
get you anything.

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
If you have a lot of expense this year,

57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,920
you don't have to buy me any presents.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
Hey! Really?

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,320
But can I ask for something else?

60
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,680
There it is. I thought so.

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,200
Just asking for your permission.

62
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,680
Permission for?

63
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
One second.

64
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,080
What is it? Let me see.

65
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Here!

66
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,480
Lunar is hosting a Johnny Kim fan-meet.

67
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,360
So I'm asking if I can go
as a birthday present.

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
Please, Wa.

69
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll get to meet Johnny Kim!

70
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,400
Please! Please!

71
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,960
Okay. Let me see.

72
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
Please!

73
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,400
Oh, God! 5,000 baht?

74
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Are you serious?

75
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
No, you don't have to worry about it.
I'll take care of the ticket.

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,480
I've been saving up
from my drawing jobs for this.

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,760
Please, Wa.

78
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,720
Numtarn's mom will drive us.

79
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,120
You don't have to worry. It'll be safe.

80
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,320
But it's 5,000 baht, Vivi.
Isn't it too expensive?

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Sorry that I'm late.
What are you guys talking about?

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,040
Oh, we're done talking.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,960
What's left is for Wa to decide

84
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,600
if she wants to be a good sister
or a bad one.

85
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Vivi!

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,880
Well, please take care of her.

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,080
You guys have fun!

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,560
You're not coming?

89
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,800
Huh?

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,920
Come with us.

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,640
You want me to come
and be a third-wheel with you guys?

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,680
Are you cold?

93
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
Seems like you're freezing.

94
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,000
No, I'm okay.
It's just that I don't usually come here.

95
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,240
More like haven't been here before.

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Wa!

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Do you like it?

98
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,960
No…

99
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Do you want to check it out?

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,160
I think I won't
be able to afford these dresses.

101
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,160
It's fine.

102
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
There's a store for a reason.

103
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Let's check it out.

104
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
That's true.

105
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,280
Come on, Wa. Don't be so stubborn!

106
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,760
Hey! Where are you going?

107
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm going inside, just like Four said.

108
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,600
Come on, I'll show you inside.

109
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,520
I think this dress suits you.

110
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,440
Guys, look! Isn't it cute?

111
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
Yes, it is. I'll buy it for you.

112
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,560
It's okay, Four.

113
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
It's expensive!

114
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,760
Wa…

115
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
How about I buy you just one dress?
Sound good?

116
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,840
Wa!

117
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Please, please. Wa, please.

118
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,880
Okay, fine.

119
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Thank you so much, Four.

120
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,560
If you want to play like this,
I won't go easy on you!

121
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,280
Bring it on!

122
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,400
Well, let's get started! Go!

123
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,600
Wa!

124
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Go, Wa!

125
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Come on!

126
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
Come on, Wa!

127
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
Wa!

128
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,080
Hey! I'm losing!

129
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
Wa!

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm so tired, Wa.

131
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,360
- Are you tired?
- But it was really fun.

132
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,880
Hey, guys! Let's go take pictures
at the photo booth.

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,800
Come on!

134
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
- Vivi!
- Let's go!

135
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
Are you ready?

136
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,120
Okay.

137
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Three, two, one. Let's go!

138
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,800
We should put the hats on.

139
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
- Which one should I wear?
- Is this one cute?

140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,560
Yes, Wa.

141
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
- Okay, I'll put it on.
- Which one should I wear?

142
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,840
And for you, Vivi. This one.

143
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
Hey!

144
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,760
Baby chick.

145
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,520
Why am I a baby chick?

146
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,280
Because you look like it.

147
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
Wa…

148
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,680
So cute.

149
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
See? It fits you.

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,120
Yeah!

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,720
One of the photos is missing.

152
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
What's missing?

153
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,240
One of the photos is missing.

154
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,040
We must have dropped it.

155
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
That's okay.

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,360
We can take it again.

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,120
Because I wanted to see
the baby chick jumps around.

158
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Wa!

159
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,000
What's going on?

160
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,720
It's Four…

161
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,400
Hey, Vivi's birthday is coming up, right?

162
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes, are you going
to get me a baby chick hat?

163
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,000
Who's going to get you the baby chick hat?

164
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
Here.

165
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,320
It's the fan-meet ticket!

166
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
And hi-touch with Johnny Kim!

167
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
Four…

168
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,400
I overheard you guys
talking earlier.

169
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
I wanted to give her a gift.

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,280
Thank you so much, Four!
Thank you! Thank you!

171
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
Please let me go, Wa. Please.

172
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Please.

173
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,960
- Please!
- Okay.

174
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,800
Yay! Thank you so much, Four. Thank you!

175
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,320
Add me and I'll send you the ticket.

176
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,640
But you have to take care of yourself!

177
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,320
I will. I'll let Numtarn know right now.

178
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,440
You got her an expensive gift this year.

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
She'll expect more next year.

180
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,920
Come on.

181
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,560
Even if I have to buy her tickets
to go watch it in Korea, I could.

182
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
As long as you stay with me.

183
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,400
Of course I'll stay.

184
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,840
Let's go pay my grandmother
a visit next Saturday.

185
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,920
Even though she won't really remember…

186
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,680
I still want to let her know

187
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,280
that you're my special one.

188
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,960
Please come with me.

189
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,360
Okay.

190
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh!

191
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,080
Why is the baby chick like that?

192
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,040
Aren't you happy?
Today is the fan-meet!

193
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,560
It took me time to find the umbrella.
Take the medicine with you too, Vivi.

194
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
Four, you're here already?

195
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
Take this with you.

196
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,760
Wa, I'm going for just one night.

197
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,600
But you have to be ready,

198
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,080
especially when you're sleeping over.

199
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,320
Hey, do they have seating at the event?

200
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,920
Don't tell me that you want Vivi
to bring a chair with her.

201
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm just asking.

202
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
I'm saved. Numtarn's mom is here
to pick me up. See you.

203
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,640
- Hey! Vivi!
- Bye!

204
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,400
Take care of yourself,
always be with a friend.

205
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
Okay, Wa. See you!

206
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,400
That's enough, Wa.

207
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,200
Vivi's not a kid anymore.

208
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,160
She's turning 16 tomorrow.

209
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm worried about her,
especially this time.

210
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,760
I don't know why.

211
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,920
Worry about yourself first.
We're leaving soon.

212
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,160
I just need to change, then I'll be ready.

213
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,800
Just need to change?

214
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Yes.

215
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,200
No.

216
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
Why?

217
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Close your eyes.

218
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
Why are you blushing?

219
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,640
The weather is pretty hot, isn't it?

220
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,680
What are you thinking about?

221
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
What? That's crazy! No.

222
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,080
It was this exact same spot,
just like last time.

223
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
Even though I can't remember anything,

224
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,160
but I surely can this time.

225
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,760
I don't think it's a good idea, Four.

226
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
We'll be late to see your grandmother.

227
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,319
We can tell her…
that we were running errands.

228
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,160
Shouldn't you take that first?

229
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,560
No.

230
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,920
The phone.

231
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes.

232
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,240
Yes.

233
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
Okay.

234
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,400
I'll be back.

235
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Where are you going?

236
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,040
Taking stuff to the messenger.

237
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,840
My friend's working on the report.
I have to send her something.

238
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,080
You don't have to be there?

239
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,160
I finished my part last night

240
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
because today I'll be spending time
with my girlfriend.

241
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,520
I'll be back.

242
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
Okay.

243
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,040
Doesn't she blush like the others?

244
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,800
Can we stop
at the supermarket first?

245
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,240
To buy some snacks
for your grandmother.

246
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,440
My grandmother has to
watch her diet.

247
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,080
She can't have any snacks.

248
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,960
The step-mother?
Do we have to get her anything?

249
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Waran and her son aren't there.

250
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,960
I wouldn't go if they were there.

251
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,440
Something wrong?

252
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
Nothing.

253
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,680
- Grandma.
- Oh, Four.

254
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,520
Grandma, this is Jattawa.

255
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,520
Hello.

256
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Is this your friend?

257
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,760
She's my special one, Grandma.

258
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,160
How adorable.

259
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,720
Have you eaten anything?

260
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,720
- No, we want to eat with you.
- Grandma seems fine.

261
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
She doesn't look like someone
who has dementia.

262
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,240
Four, go get your dad
so he can join us.

263
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,040
Dad can't come eat with us anymore.

264
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,080
Are you still mad at him
about the fight last night?

265
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,480
I'll open
a new sporting goods factory for you

266
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,400
so you can compete with him. Sound good?

267
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,680
Grandma…

268
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,320
Please go ahead to the dining room.
We'll be right there.

269
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,520
Okay.

270
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Please look after her, Dao.

271
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,520
You might have to
introduce yourself again in there.

272
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,320
It's fine, I like it.

273
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,680
I enjoy having you introduce me
as your special one.

274
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,680
But just now, grandma seems like
she can remember you.

275
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,680
It would be nice if she can remember
where the documents are kept too.

276
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Oh, what brought you home today?

277
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,360
If I knew that you were coming back,
I wouldn't be here.

278
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
And you brought someone to help you
steal Grandma's inheritance.

279
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,480
Do you have any pointers?

280
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,240
As someone who already has
experience with it.

281
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,560
I'll take my things to the room.

282
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,840
Don't you speak such nonsense ever again.

283
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Especially in front of Film.

284
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,800
Four…

285
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,200
Four, have you been
going to the company lately?

286
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,080
You need to learn the ropes.

287
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,200
You should try eating more vegetables.

288
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Dao told me you hardly eat them.

289
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,840
You're always telling me to eat,
just like your dad.

290
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,960
Like father, like daughter.

291
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,200
Four, you'll have to carry on his legacy.

292
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,520
The next CEO of the company
is his rightful successor, Film.

293
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,920
Who's that?

294
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,760
Grandma is not in good health.

295
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,200
She's not aware of it.

296
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
I'll make it clear,
so the person who stirs things up

297
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,840
can keep that in mind.

298
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,560
If telling the truths means trouble,

299
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,080
you might want to consider
telling it to your son as well.

300
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
What's this about?

301
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,320
Go ahead, tell me
what lies you're going to make up.

302
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,800
But remember,
if you can't back it up with evidence,

303
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,440
I'll give you trouble.

304
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,240
Are you referring to the evidence
that you sent to me the other day?

305
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,640
You remember?

306
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
Well, it's…

307
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,680
It's the photo of me not eating vegetables
that Dao sent, right?

308
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,560
This is what you get
for exploiting a sick person as your tool…

309
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,520
a karma of an ungraceful granddaughter.

310
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,080
What about a person who lies like you?
What do they get?

311
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Wa…

312
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
Did I say something wrong?

313
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,440
You lied that your affair's son
was Four's father's son.

314
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,600
Hey, you!

315
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,840
Or if Film wants to see the DNA tests
that grandma kept, it's fine too.

316
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Mother! What is she talking about?

317
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Prove it!

318
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,000
If you really have it, then show us.

319
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,200
I wonder how you can recreate it.
With a magic spell?

320
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,120
Hurry up.

321
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,040
You don't have it?
Well then, I'll sue you.

322
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
Thank you so much, Wa.

323
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,960
It would've been really awkward
without you today.

324
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,440
Four, you should complete
the curator filing for your grandmother.

325
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
What made you say that all of a sudden?

326
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,000
I want you
to reclaim what's rightfully yours

327
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,040
from your stepmother and her son.

328
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,680
I will find the DNA test
as soon as possible.

329
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,160
Well… I think
we have to find another way to prove it,

330
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
because I think
the DNA test no longer exists.

331
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
You said it like you know something.

332
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,880
Well…

333
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,560
I was just saying what's possible.

334
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,800
I don't want us
to rely on something that's uncertain.

335
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,920
Okay. I'll find a way
to expose that stepmother.

336
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,880
Four, can I be excused?

337
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,120
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

338
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Not at all.

339
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,040
I ordered the Johnny Kim photobook
for Vivi's birthday.

340
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,760
I have to pick it up
before the store closes.

341
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,520
I'll give you a ride.

342
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,360
That's okay, Four. It's totally fine.

343
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
Miss Four, madam is asking for you.

344
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,160
You should stay with your grandma.

345
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,000
You rarely get to come home.

346
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,080
I can go there by myself.
It's close to the condo.

347
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,480
Okay, I'll call you later.

348
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,480
Okay.

349
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,560
Get home safe.

350
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Okay.

351
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,280
Thank you so much!

352
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,600
Here it is.

353
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,080
So cute!

354
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,440
- Here's the VIP ticket.
- Thank you!

355
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,320
- So cute!
- Yes!

356
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,320
HAVE YOU REACHED?

357
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,440
Numtarn, let's take a selfie for Wa.
Right here!

358
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,880
- One, two, three!
- Why didn't I get the 'hi-touch' pass?

359
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,080
The 'hi-touch' pass is only for those
with VIP tickets

360
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,600
which also come in pink.

361
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,960
So what? Here! I already paid!

362
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,280
It's not that!

363
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,440
Yours is a standard ticket.

364
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,920
- So? They're all the same.
- Let's go.

365
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,440
Am I right?

366
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,360
They're not the same, sir.

367
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,600
Let me take a quick peek.

368
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,600
Why is there nothing about Vivi
after this date?

369
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm sorry.

370
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,360
What?

371
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,920
I'm sorry that I'm the reason Vivi's gone.

372
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
- Here.
- It's the fan-meet ticket!

373
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,480
And hi-touch with Johnny Kim!

374
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,480
Or does something go wrong at the event?

375
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh, excuse me.

376
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Four, I'll go meet Vivi at the event.

377
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
Let's go, Numtarn! Aim at the middle.

378
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,040
- One more.
- One, two, three!

379
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,680
Oh, almost got it!

380
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,120
- One more!
- Numtarn, we should head inside.

381
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,680
The grand prize in this booth
is available!

382
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,720
A Johnny Kim limited edition pillow.
Win yours now!

383
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,200
Let's go check it out, Vivi!
This way. Come on!

384
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,760
The grand prize is up for grabs.

385
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,800
We'll get it for sure!

386
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
Come here!

387
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,640
- Vivi!
- I've already used up my power today.

388
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,560
Hey!

389
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,800
Vivi!

390
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,200
Vivi! Are you okay? Are you hurt?

391
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,160
Vivi…

392
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,560
Vivi, Wa, are you okay?

393
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
Vivi, Are you all right?

394
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,320
Wa…

395
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,760
You're okay now.

396
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,960
How did you make it on time?

397
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,240
Or did you turn back time to save me?

398
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,720
Why didn't you tell me

399
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,880
that you didn't see your future
after you turned 15?

400
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,360
Why?

401
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,440
Vivi.

402
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm sorry.
Even though I didn't see my future,

403
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,040
I believe it will end up like that.

404
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,000
How could you think that way?

405
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,160
You've never seen your future.

406
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,120
Please don't do that again.

407
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
Do you understand?

408
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,640
I know you'll always have my back.

409
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,800
And you can always turn back time
and help me, am I right?

410
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,800
I'll never let anything happen to you,
I promise.

411
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,760
Thank you so much.

412
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,160
How could I let anything happen to you?

413
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,880
I mean, thank you for my birthday present.
I love it!

414
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Wait, how did you know? Because it's at…

415
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,440
Well, I saw that I'd already opened
the birthday gift you gave me.

416
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,080
Hey! Was that the first vision you had
after you turned 16?

417
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah, it was!

418
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,320
Vivi!

419
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,760
Wa!

420
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,880
I'm so sorry.

421
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,400
I'm okay now, right?

422
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,000
You've just had your vision
so I guess you're okay!

423
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,200
Four!

424
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,120
Are you ready to sing Johnny Sim's songs?

425
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,840
It's Johnny Kim!

426
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,600
Thank you so much, Four!

427
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,600
You're my baby chick.
I have to look after you.

428
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,840
Watch it!

429
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,840
Excuse me! Vivi!

430
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,080
Yes?

431
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,240
The staff apologized for what happened

432
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,040
and said they'll give you
a Johnny Kim limited edition pillow

433
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,560
as an apology.

434
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,920
Really?

435
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,320
Hey! Pay more attention to yourself
just like the pillow!

436
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,000
Anyways you two take care of each other.

437
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll see you at home tomorrow.
Your gift awaits!

438
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,240
I will!

439
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,760
Oh! People are heading inside.
We'd better get going!

440
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
- Okay!
- Bye!

441
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,440
Bye!

442
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
Let's go.

443
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,760
I assumed you'd be worried
and wouldn't let her go watch the concert.

444
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,199
Vivi will make it past tonight. Surely!

445
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,560
How did you know?

446
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,440
I just knew.

447
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,159
Does that mean you're free
to spend time with me tonight?

448
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,280
Four!

449
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,679
There are so many things
I want to do with you.

450
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,159
What are you talking about?
I'm leaving.

451
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,239
Wait!

452
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,480
The moon looks stunning tonight,
don't you think?

453
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,679
I wish we could stay here
under the moon the whole night.

454
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,880
Do you enjoy outdoor activities?

455
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,600
Four! What are you talking about?

456
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,200
Well, you won't be able to see the moon
if you stay inside.

457
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,640
What's on your mind?

458
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,040
I think so too.

459
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,640
You're a little bunny.

460
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,240
You like to call me that.
Is because I like to look at the moon?

461
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Because you tend to panic easily.

462
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
Four!

463
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,520
Little bunny.

464
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Stop.

465
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,480
Thank you.

466
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,520
I'll make it for you.

467
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,200
You've never had Thai-barbecue before,
have you?

468
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
Of course I have.

469
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,440
Here, let me show you how it's done.

470
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,800
First, add the vegetables to
the sizzling pan to absorb the heat.

471
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,720
Then you can add the pork.

472
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,440
The vegetables keep the oil
from splattering.

473
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,360
Wow.

474
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,440
That's amazing.

475
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,840
It's called "street smart".

476
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,840
Well then, could you feed me?

477
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,080
All right then, I'll feed you.

478
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,040
This piece looks good.

479
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,720
Can you feed me again?

480
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,240
Come on!

481
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
You really got it!

482
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,520
- It's so adorable!
- It really is!

483
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,520
Mom!

484
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,800
Hi!

485
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,760
- Hello.
- Hi, Vivi.

486
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,400
How was it? You had fun?

487
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,680
It was really fun!

488
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,320
Did you get his signature?

489
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,320
I was too shy to ask for it.

490
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,120
Vivi, my grandmother's caregiver
has an urgent errand today,

491
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,520
so I have to take Numtarn
to be with her tonight.

492
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,960
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,760
It's totally fine.

494
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,040
I'll drop you off
at your condo tonight then.

495
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,760
- Okay, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

496
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,880
That's too bad, Vivi.

497
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,480
It's okay.
I'll get to see my birthday gift

498
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,600
that my sister got me too!

499
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,080
Okay.

500
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,840
All right, let's get going.

501
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,320
- Okay.
- Let's go.

502
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
I'll give Vivi a call.

503
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,160
Worried she'll change her mind
and be a third wheel tonight?

504
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,560
Four!

505
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,560
Aren't you going to call her?

506
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,920
No, I'm pretty sure
she'll be back tomorrow.

507
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,320
Johnny Kim photobook!

508
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,960
I LOVE THE PRESENT!
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MY LOVELY SISTER.

509
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,480
I'll wait and thank her in person
when she's back.

510
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,000
Special photobook.

511
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,920
She's back.

512
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,520
I haven't cleaned my room.

513
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,280
The car's fine too.

514
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,480
Oh! Someone will see us!

515
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,760
Well, let me go up
and clean my room first.

516
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,880
Vivi!

517
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
What happened?

518
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,520
Vivi… How could this happen?

519
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,800
Please let me make it on time.

520
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,440
Please don't harm Vivi.

521
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,920
I'll give up everything for her.

522
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,800
Vivi!

523
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,520
Vivi!

524
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,840
Vivi!

525
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,640
I can't lose you…

526
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,240
How could this happen?

527
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
Please wake up!

528
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,200
You can't leave me like this.

529
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,800
I know you'll always have my back,

530
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,000
and that you can always
turn back time and help me.

531
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,120
Turn back!

532
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,720
Turn back!
Why can't I turn back the time?
