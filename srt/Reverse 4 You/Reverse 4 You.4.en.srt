1
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,120
Wa…

2
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,320
Four!

3
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
Somebody help!

4
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,240
Four…

5
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,760
Turn back the time, Jattawa.

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,520
Please turn back.

7
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,400
- Turn back!
- Please!

8
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,560
Four…

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,160
Can you hear me, Four?

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,720
Please stay with me.

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,080
The ambulance is on the way.

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,040
Four…

13
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,920
Four, please stay with me.

14
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,640
Four!

15
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Somebody help me, please!

16
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,760
Help me! Anybody!

17
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
Four…

18
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,960
Please don't leave me.

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,560
It's already midnight, a new day.

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,920
Wa…

21
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,440
Wa! Are you okay, Wa?

22
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,360
As long as you're okay,

23
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,760
I turned back the time from yesterday
to save you.

24
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,760
I've missed you since yesterday too.

25
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Thank you for your cooperation.
Please go testify to the police station.

26
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
Let's go.

28
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,120
All done?

29
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,280
How did you know
that I was going to be in an accident?

30
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,160
And you said
you turned back the time from yesterday.

31
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
What do you mean?

32
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,600
Oh, no. I slipped up, didn't I?

33
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,040
It means that I turned back time
to save you.

34
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,200
I was joking.

35
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,760
I saw that the car was driving erratically
so I saved you.

36
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,760
But what I said earlier
that I've missed you since yesterday,

37
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,400
that wasn't a joke.

38
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,560
But you went on a date with that lawyer.

39
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,480
And also with my family.
That's why I went.

40
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
Oh, I see.

41
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
So what about the lawyer,
has there been any progress?

42
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Pak?

43
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
He's stalling.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Waran hired him
after my father passed away.

45
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,880
Now they just wanted to know
what my next move is.

46
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,920
Do you still think that I'm dating him?

47
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Is she reading my mind?

48
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,840
Because I already have my eye on someone.

49
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,480
But whatever, I gave her my message-ID
but she hasn't added me yet.

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,480
Message-ID? She's never given it to me.

51
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
Who did she give it to?

52
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,320
Who is it?

53
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,760
I mean, do I know her?

54
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,800
Huh? I do?

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,640
Did she hang out with me
just to get closer to that person?

56
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,560
I can't believe Four did this to me.

57
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,520
How could she treat me so nicely
and have a crush on someone else?

58
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
Wait until it's my turn.

59
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Are you going to crush it?

60
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
Yes!

61
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,920
I meant my food! It's completely ruined.

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
You're upset at your soulmate,
not the food!

63
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
What about when
she likes someone else?

64
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
Isn't that upsetting?

65
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,160
But ultimately you belong together.

66
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
And in your fantasy--

67
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,400
My vision!

68
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,920
Fine, in your vision.

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
Do you see me and Four
living together when we're 60?

70
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't exaggerate.

71
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,520
She'll probably
get over her crush soon.

72
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,120
You see each other all the time.

73
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,160
Plus, she's living next door, remember?

74
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,560
And just like that…

75
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Could you get the door
for your soulmate please?

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,520
There's no more soulmate. I'm over it.

77
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,520
Sure, you're over it.

78
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,240
Who are you?

79
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,440
What's this?

80
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,480
Are you living here
like it's your own house?

81
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,800
Wait, what's going on?

82
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,480
I see why she wanted to live alone,

83
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,440
so she can have her friends
over for parties.

84
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,960
Are you sure this is the right apartment?

85
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,480
I can read the room number!

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
Don't be disrespectful to me.

87
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,600
I haven't done anything wrong.

88
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
Hey!

89
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,679
What are you doing here?

90
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
Let's talk somewhere else.

91
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
Why do we have to talk here?

92
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,840
I wonder that too.

93
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,800
There's nothing to talk about.

94
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,240
You left early yesterday.

95
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,480
If you couldn't
think about being respectful,

96
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
at least think about
your grandmother's feelings.

97
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
How dare you bring up my grandmother?

98
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,400
You know she can't remember things.

99
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,080
You really want her to be incapacitated?

100
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,120
Why don't you let the court
be the judge of that?

101
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Who is it, Wa?

102
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,240
I think that's her stepmother.

103
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Are they fighting?

104
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,680
Words coming out
from a mistress's daughter,

105
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,400
how convincing is that?

106
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,640
If it's not that convincing,
then you wouldn't be here, would you?

107
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I don't want my family
to be involved in a scandal.

108
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,480
It's already been bad
since we have someone like you.

109
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,520
Then feel free to leave, leave my family.

110
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,160
And take your lover's son with you.

111
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,560
Four!

112
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,520
You can wait until the day
that I, the mistress's daughter,

113
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,680
takes everything away from you.

114
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,800
You're a gold digger
just like your mother.

115
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
Nothing good,
except a parasite for this family.

116
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,040
Then stop messing with a parasite like me!

117
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll see you in court, the day I prove
that Film isn't my father's son.

118
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,960
I thought you were over it.
You're not mad at her anymore?

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm still mad at her.

120
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
But I still want to help her.

121
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Have you asked her if she wants your help?

122
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,720
I'll ask her.

123
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,960
Four… I…

124
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm so sorry
that my stepmother bothered you.

125
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,840
If she comes back, I'll--

126
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,960
File the application in court.

127
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,680
It doesn't have to go that far.

128
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,520
I meant for your grandmother.

129
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,680
You can prepare the court application.
I'll help you.

130
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,840
Free of charge?

131
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,720
It's fine, we'll call it an internship.

132
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,200
But it takes a lot of time, doesn't it?

133
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,520
- I can do it my whole life.
- Huh?

134
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,160
Well…

135
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,720
I mean it wouldn't take that much time.

136
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,600
- But you just said--
- That's what I said.

137
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,880
If there's anything I can help with,
just let me know.

138
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,840
Wa…

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,280
Kie! Why are you spiking the ball
like you hate it so much?

140
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
That's it for today, everyone.

141
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,880
What's up?

142
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
Thanks.

143
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,200
Any updates on the witness?

144
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
I looked into it.

145
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
She's not popular on campus.

146
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,720
Now she's living
in the same building as Four.

147
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,720
They carpooled together,

148
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,080
so I guess they must be pretty close.

149
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,080
Set up a meeting.
I have something to deal with.

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
What's the meaning of social norms?

151
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,760
I just asked you.

152
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,240
Hello.

153
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,160
Hello, Wa, it's me, Pook.

154
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,160
I manage the student
representatives' photo shoot.

155
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,960
I'm afraid there's an issue
with your pictures.

156
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,680
Do you mind coming over for a reshoot?

157
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh… Right now?

158
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
Yes, it will be quick.

159
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Okay, I'll see you there.

160
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,680
Hey, I'll be back.

161
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
Okay.

162
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,400
Hello, Vivi.

163
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Where are you?

164
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm heading to the photography studio.

165
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,080
You can't go there.

166
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,120
Why? What's going on?

167
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,720
I had a vision.

168
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,240
There was a girl in a volleyball uniform

169
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,320
was talking about you
with a bunch of people.

170
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,680
Then they bullied you
in some sort of a photography studio.

171
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,880
What? Photography studio?

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,520
Why are they bullying me?

173
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,800
They wanted you to fight back.

174
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,120
Fight back?

175
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,760
Yes, I saw that you lost your temper
and someone was recording a video of you.

176
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,520
They looked really satisfied.

177
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,640
One of them said,
"Let's make her miserable just like Four".

178
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,840
It's Kie…

179
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,000
Huh?

180
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,920
And did you see
what would happen if I didn't go?

181
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,080
I didn't, I only saw parts of it.

182
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,840
But please don't go there.

183
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,760
If I don't go today,
she'll find another day to hurt me again.

184
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,720
She won't quit easily.

185
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,640
So what are you going to do?

186
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
It ends today.

187
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Let's see if you can make me a villain.

188
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,480
Why do you look surprised?

189
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,320
Or should I be somewhere else, not here?

190
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,000
I was just surprised
to see you at my faculty.

191
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Excuse me, I've got things to do.

192
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,720
Don't blame it on Pook
that it didn't go according to your plan.

193
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,920
What are you talking about?

194
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,520
Why don't you blame it
on your barbaric master plan?

195
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
Even your teammate couldn't take it
so she told me all about it.

196
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Are you trying to mess up Kie's mind
and make her doubt her teammates?

197
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
Exactly, I'll make her
suspect her teammates

198
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,760
so she'll finally reveal her true self.

199
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,800
Then I'll use her own plan against her.

200
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,280
You're lying.

201
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,120
If I'm lying, then I have
an ability to foresee the future

202
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,520
where you've sent someone to hurt me
and take a video of me

203
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,120
so that you can release it
to destroy my reputation,

204
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,520
just like how you did it to Four.

205
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,720
Let's talk somewhere else, Wa.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Why? Are you afraid that someone will see?

207
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,120
If you're going to do it, then do it here.

208
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,560
What if I tell the others
that Four sent you here

209
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,120
to sabotage my student election campaign?

210
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,040
Are they going to believe you still?

211
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,000
If you're so confident, then do it.

212
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,520
So the others will know
how obnoxious you and Four really are.

213
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,440
Fuck you, Kie!

214
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,040
Leave my girl alone.

215
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,920
What are you going to do?
Aren't you on probation?

216
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,440
I'll make you join me,
if you don't leave her alone.

217
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
What lie did you tell her?

218
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,720
Why did she come all the way here
to provoke me?

219
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
It's none of your business.

220
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,840
You have no right to do this to her.

221
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,960
You guys are so protective.

222
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,000
Are you related? Sibling? Cousin?

223
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
Sister from another mother?

224
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,360
Daughter of a legitimate wife?

225
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Oh…

226
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,080
Or are you lovers?

227
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,360
It's none of your fucking business.

228
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,600
Since you're mad,
I'll take that as a yes.

229
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,760
Well, please tell your girlfriend
to never talk about this ever again.

230
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,040
Also watch her legs,

231
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,120
she might need an internal fixation
just like you.

232
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,640
A "titanium couple", that's catchy.

233
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,960
This bitch…

234
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,000
Four!

235
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,000
Let's leave.

236
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,360
She's not going to stop.
You know that, right?

237
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
We'll find another way.

238
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,440
No, this ends today.

239
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,080
Are you going to use violence again?

240
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,320
She crossed the line.
How could she do this to you?

241
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,800
Kie! Now that you're alone,
you can stop pretending.

242
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,120
Why? Are you going to slap me again?

243
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,560
Even if I have no evidence this time,
I can still get you.

244
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,240
I have nothing left to lose.
You've already ruined my life.

245
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,840
You did it all to yourself, remember?

246
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,480
You slapped me first,
in front of the everyone in the campus.

247
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,160
Did you forget why I slapped you?

248
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,280
Why are you bringing this up again?

249
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,160
Because for me, it never ends.

250
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,080
What do you really want?

251
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,800
Because you never gave me an apology
or admitted that you did it.

252
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,320
Fine! I was the one who broke your leg

253
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,120
and took your spot
in the national team's trial. Satisfied?

254
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
All because my family isn't
loaded like yours.

255
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
You'll be fine
even without an athletic scholarships.

256
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,760
Your family can easily
support your tuition, unlike mine.

257
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,320
You've never felt guilty
for destroying my future athletic path.

258
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,280
So what do you want me to do?

259
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,400
Admit it to everyone.

260
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,920
Are you stupid?

261
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,280
I'd rather get slapped a hundred times
than admit that right now.

262
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Well, you asked for it.

263
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880
Don't do it, Four!

264
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,440
That's all.

265
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,200
I hoped that
you'll be sincere with me for once.

266
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,800
But I guess with a person like you,
that will never happen.

267
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,560
You played dirty.

268
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,800
It was the only way
for a sneaky person like you.

269
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,520
If you won't leave Jattawa alone,

270
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
you might have to pay me back
much more than this.

271
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,760
It could even be your future.

272
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
Let's go, Wa.

273
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,480
Wait for me here.
I'll go get the first aid kit.

274
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,320
It's fine, I'm okay.

275
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,760
What about you? Are you okay?

276
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,360
I wasn't grabbed on the arm like you.

277
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,800
It's not that.

278
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,920
I mean, how are you feeling?

279
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,920
Are you okay?

280
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,520
I thought that it'd make me feel better.

281
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,920
But I'm no different from her, right?

282
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
Of course you're different.

283
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,040
I know that you wanted
to give her a second chance,

284
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,800
but she took it for granted
until she realized that it was too late.

285
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

286
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,400
Because you were being so serious,
even more than I was.

287
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,520
Because it's about you.

288
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,480
I wouldn't care
if it was about someone else.

289
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,480
Wa!

290
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,760
Khun…

291
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,080
Are you all right?

292
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,960
I heard
you had a fight with a senior.

293
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,760
It's over now, I'm fine.

294
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,040
Well, I've got to go.
I'm picking up my car from the garage.

295
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,680
What's up with her?

296
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,040
Why does she keep bothering you?

297
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,480
Please stop judging her.

298
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,080
Then why are you
being so optimistic about her?

299
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,200
Why?

300
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,920
Does she has a crush on you?

301
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,840
That's nonsense, Khun!

302
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,760
Fine! I was the one who broke your leg

303
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,800
and took your spot
in the national team's trial. Satisfied?

304
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,360
Hey, how many times
are you going to watch it?

305
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,120
It's entertaining.

306
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Have you seen the comments?

307
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,960
It's insane!

308
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,440
If I was her, I would've withdrawn
from the student elections.

309
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,160
Did you see it in your vision?

310
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,960
Top just called me and said that
Kie is withdrawing from the election.

311
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,360
Really?

312
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,520
Yes.

313
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,880
Wa, come take a look at this!

314
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,360
There're so many comments about Four.

315
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,560
Let me see.

316
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,440
Many people are supporting Four.
They're saying sorry to her as well.

317
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,680
Sorry for saying bad things
about you before

318
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,880
You're right.

319
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,920
You've never felt guilt
for ruining my future athletic path.

320
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,200
"Love you, Four"
"Oh my God! My Four!"

321
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,760
Admit it.

322
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,280
I guess you have to start dating her
before someone steals your opportunity!

323
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,760
I'd rather get slapped a hundred times…

324
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,320
But I don't know who she's interested in.

325
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,760
She's just interested.
You can change her mind.

326
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,280
Plus you guys are getting
to know each other more and more.

327
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,880
That's why I know
it's hard to change her mind.

328
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,280
Wa, trust me--

329
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,160
Hey, drop it.

330
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,640
Pack your things
and make sure you don't forget anything.

331
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,080
Art camp is being hosted at my school.

332
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,400
If I forget something.
you'll bring it.

333
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
No, I won't. Goodnight!

334
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,160
You wouldn't want me to come back here.

335
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
Huh? What was that?

336
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,800
Nothing.

337
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm here to pay my rent!

338
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,440
Right on time.

339
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,840
I've got the invoice here.
Please scan here.

340
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,160
Okay.

341
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,680
Paying rent on time, unlike someone…

342
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,760
All done.

343
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,400
Okay, please sign here.

344
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,760
Can I borrow a pen?

345
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay, one second.

346
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,680
Where's the pen?

347
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
Where is it?

348
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
ROOM OWNER:
SEEMAYSA NARAWATTANAVECH

349
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Is Four the owner of the room
that I'm renting?

350
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,440
Yes, she's the owner of this room.

351
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,160
But I don't know why she moved
into the smaller room next door.

352
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,720
She asked me to rent her room
out for you at a low price.

353
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
That's why that stepmother
knocked on the wrong door.

354
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,320
She saved me from Jib,
protected me from Kie,

355
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,480
buys me things, and let me stay
in her room for cheap.

356
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,000
She's definitely into me.

357
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
But she's into someone else too.

358
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,720
What's up with her?

359
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,560
Could it be that
all that she did for me is…

360
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,840
out of sympathy?

361
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,480
Four!

362
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm Khun.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

363
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,080
I'll make it quick.

364
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
What is it?

365
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,800
I like Wa.

366
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,720
Why are you telling me this?

367
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,280
Because I think…

368
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,600
you might like her too.

369
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
I don't care who likes her.

370
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
I only care about her feelings.

371
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,120
I've told her how I feel.

372
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,720
And the fact that we're still close
means that she feels the same way.

373
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,560
I think you shouldn't
make her feel uncomfortable.

374
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,480
She still hasn't come?

375
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,280
It's 9:00 p.m. already?

376
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Gosh, why am I always hungry at this hour?

377
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
I'm not going to wait anymore.

378
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,080
Rice with fried eggs and ham please.

379
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,760
Okay, please wait a minute.

380
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,080
Can I take your order?

381
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,760
Crab sticks and ham please.

382
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,760
All right, please wait a minute.

383
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,560
Hey! Is it done?

384
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,880
Miss, you've had too much to drink.
You should go home.

385
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,040
Please, miss.

386
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,440
Here, please take my money.

387
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,280
- Please, no more.
- Is it done?

388
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,160
- You're scaring off…
- Four…

389
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,760
Do you know who I am?

390
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,680
Four, that's enough.

391
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,520
You've had too much to drink
and now you're completely drunk.

392
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,000
Are you haunting me even when I'm drunk?

393
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,040
You're so wasted.
Why are you drinking so much?

394
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
Come on, let's go.

395
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Why do you care?

396
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,240
Four, come on.

397
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,520
Leave.

398
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,320
Why don't you go be with your friend?

399
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
Which friend?

400
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,400
I don't understand. You're mumbling.

401
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,520
It's Khun.

402
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,320
What about Khun?

403
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,680
You like him, don't you?

404
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,240
You're being ridiculous. That's enough.

405
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,960
Stop, you're too drunk.

406
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,040
You're drunk!

407
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,760
I'm… not drunk.

408
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,960
Four!

409
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,320
Four!

410
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,800
- Watch your step, Four.
- Let go.

411
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,160
I said I can walk by myself.

412
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
We're almost there.

413
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,200
We're here.

414
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,080
Not this room!

415
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,320
Hey! Who the hell are you?

416
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,040
Why are you in my room?

417
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,640
This is my room.

418
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,320
Look at the room number.

419
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
I'm so sorry, my friend's drunk.

420
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,560
You're mistaken, this is my room.

421
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,280
Wait! Come back and open the door!

422
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,800
Your room is that way, Four!

423
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,200
We're here.

424
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,560
Where's the keycard?

425
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh… Four!

426
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,560
Is he good to you?

427
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,880
Huh? Who?

428
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,960
Must be really good.

429
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,600
Hey, don't fall asleep yet!

430
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,720
What should I do?

431
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,400
Slowly…

432
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,800
I've never let anyone get in bed
without taking a shower before.

433
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,280
Why do you look so real today?

434
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,080
So real?

435
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,520
Fine, I'll take it off.

436
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,120
I'm taking it off.

437
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,800
Hold on, Four.

438
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,960
I'll get you some clothes to change into.

439
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
Please stay with me.

440
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,280
Please stay with me, just for now.

441
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:42,480
I was just about
to get you clothes to change into.

442
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,520
I'll be back.

443
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,880
Four, I've never…
