1
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
According to the dictionary,

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,960
"time" is an measurable period

3
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,640
during which a condition exists
or continues.

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,920
It is commonly measured
through date, month, and year.

5
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,200
But for me, time…

6
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,280
is what I possess,
the ability to control the flow of time,

7
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,400
halting it in the present
and returning to the past.

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,680
But now, I cannot control it anymore.

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,960
My future has come to an end.

10
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,800
I failed to look after it.

11
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,160
I failed to save you.

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,720
Wa…

13
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Wa…

14
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Vivi was waiting for my help,
but I failed.

15
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,280
She's gone because of me.

16
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,240
If I didn't ask you to go out that day,

17
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,960
you would've come back
and saved her in time.

18
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,760
And if I hadn't gotten her the ticket,

19
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,600
she wouldn't have had to come home alone.

20
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
Four…

21
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,640
Even if you blame yourself for her death…

22
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,640
I still consider myself more responsible.

23
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
Four, don't blame it on yourself.

24
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,520
How can I watch you blame yourself
when you did nothing wrong?

26
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
You did nothing wrong.

27
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Four…

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,280
It's because of me.

29
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm so sorry, Wa.

30
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Can't sleep, Wa?

31
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm scared…

32
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
that I'll keep dreaming about things
that haunt me.

33
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,720
Even if I can't help you
in your nightmares,

34
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
I'll be here beside you…

35
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,600
until they're over.

36
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,720
And I will always be by your side forever.

37
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,680
I promise.

38
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,400
And right now, my future is…

39
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,320
Four.

40
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,880
10 YEARS LATER

41
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
Oh, you're awake, little bunny.

42
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,800
Aren't you in a hurry for work?

43
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,040
Taking care of my girlfriend
is also a part of my work,

44
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,280
isn't it?

45
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,160
Wow, those look delicious!

46
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,160
Go brush your teeth first.

47
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,160
Okay.

48
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,640
Maybe we should move closer
to the prosecutor's office

49
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,240
so you can have more time
to eat and sleep.

50
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,880
No. You've already bought the apartments
in all the places where I was stationed.

51
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,560
Just like the one in Rayong
that nobody uses.

52
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,680
Of course it's getting used,
especially when you have to work there.

53
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,440
What if I had to move to Chiang Mai?
What would be your excuse?

54
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,680
I'd just open a new factory there.

55
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,200
I want to expand
my sporting goods market there anyway.

56
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
That's ridiculous, Four.

57
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,560
Chiang Mai, really?

58
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,240
What are my options?

59
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
My girlfriend is a prosecutor.

60
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,000
Wouldn't it be easier if I was a lawyer?

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,840
You wouldn't have to follow me everywhere.

62
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,520
Plus you can focus on dealing with Waran.

63
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,440
By now, you could've confirmed
Film's DNA and won already.

64
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,600
Wa, I've won.

65
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
I've received my rightful inheritance.

66
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,440
But if I was a lawyer--

67
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,080
And I get to be with the person I love,
Nothing else matters.

68
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,720
I wish Vivi was here with us.
It would've been nice.

69
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,760
Yes.

70
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,440
Wa, the detective has arrived.

71
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,080
The evidence in Mananya's case

72
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,640
is a CCTV footage from the house across.

73
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,679
It shows the criminal
on the night of the incident.

74
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,840
- Okay, thank you so much.
- Okay.

75
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,040
Wa, I was wondering.

76
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,280
Everyone else thinks
this case was a suicide,

77
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,480
but you're the only one
looking into it as a homicide.

78
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,920
Why is that?

79
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,400
Or have you dealt
with a similar case before?

80
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,480
CCTV recorded this man in the building
around 4:00 p.m.

81
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
He went up at 10:00 p.m.
to the 28th floor.

82
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,880
He left the building
sometime before midnight.

83
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,080
That's the same time as the incident.

84
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,080
Did it show when he entered room 2801 too?

85
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,680
Well…

86
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,640
The CCTV on the 28th floor is broken.

87
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Do you have another angle
that shows a better look of his face?

88
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,560
That's all I have.

89
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,920
Well, in that case,
I'd like a copy of the videos please.

90
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
Okay.

91
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,960
Yes, I have.

92
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,520
But that time, I was unable
to bring the suspect to justice.

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
I've got to go.

94
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,800
The case is now concluded as a suicide.

95
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,120
What? Suicide? That's impossible.

96
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,360
There's no way. Vivi would've done that.

97
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,280
According to the case file,

98
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,960
and the suicide note
posted on social media,

99
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,440
it was a suicide.

100
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
The writing style and word choice
wasn't Vivi's.

101
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,000
Where's the evidence?

102
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,480
The killer must have faked it.

103
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,680
If you're referring to Mr. Ekkachai,
he's officially not a suspect.

104
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,240
The owner of room 2803 confirmed
that Mr. Ekkachai is in fact his friend,

105
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
and he came over to his apartment
during that time.

106
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,920
What did you say?

107
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,880
The evidence presented by the detective

108
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,240
isn't enough
to press charges against the suspect.

109
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,920
If there's not enough evidence,

110
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,240
why don't you get a warrant
to interview more witnesses?

111
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,480
Ms. Jattawa, I did everything I could.

112
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,200
If it had been your sister,

113
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,320
would you still insist
you did everything you could?

114
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,640
I have nothing left to clarify.

115
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,480
Wa, let's go.

116
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,000
One day I'll show you
what it really means to do your best.

117
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,080
Mr. M, please open the door!

118
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Mr. M!

119
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,960
Please open the door!

120
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,520
- Hey! Open or I'm going to break it!
- Mr. M, open the door.

121
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,520
Guys, what's going on?

122
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
Four…

123
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Ying, do you have Mr. M's contact?

124
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,360
He said he's friends with the guy who
murdered Vivi. I need to know the truth.

125
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,520
He's already moved out.

126
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,760
Huh?

127
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,000
He packed up and left
right after he testified to the police.

128
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,400
Let's take a look at today's headlines.

129
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,120
Ms. Jattawa Piengpradabkwan,
a prosecuting officer,

130
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,680
filed murder charges
against Mr. Thammarong Pholphirak

131
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,160
in connection with
the death of Ms. Manunya Chaisaengngam.

132
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
Despite the victim's family
believing it to be a suicide,

133
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,720
the prosecutor is determined

134
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,920
to present compelling evidence
to the court on Friday.

135
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
Well done, miss prosecutor.

136
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
What would've happened

137
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,760
if the prosecutor of Vivi's case
kept on fighting for the truth?

138
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,320
Well, you wouldn't have changed your mind
to become a prosecutor.

139
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
And this case
would have been labeled a suicide.

140
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,720
The suspect would have gotten away

141
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,640
and could have
potentially committed more crimes.

142
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,360
Little chick would be really happy
if she knew that she didn't die in vain.

143
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,720
And if I didn't have you by my side,
I wouldn't have succeeded.

144
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,440
There she is.

145
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Ms. Jattawa

146
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
Can you please say a few words?

147
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,120
Ms. Jattawa, we've heard that…

148
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,400
You earned yourself a present.

149
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,560
Wait for the court hearing.
I cannot say much at the moment.

150
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,440
And how confident are you?

151
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm quite confident
we can prove he is guilty.

152
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
I'll see you again on the 20th.

153
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,600
Ms. Jattawa, a few more questions?

154
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,000
- Ms. Jattawa!
- Ms. Jattawa! Film her!

155
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,280
Ms. Jattawa,
can I ask you one more question?

156
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,280
Well done, little bunny.
Can we go now?

157
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
Yes, we can.

158
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Wa, wait for me here.

159
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,680
Who are you? Who are you?

160
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,360
Please don't! It's me, M.

161
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm…

162
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm M, I used to live next to Jattawa.

163
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,400
I have something to confess.

164
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm truly sorry.

165
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,440
I was desperate for money,

166
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,000
and he offered me a lot of money
to testify to the police

167
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,240
that we were friends.

168
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,480
So I took the deal.

169
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,960
Once I realized how bad it was…

170
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,160
I can't lose you.

171
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,480
…it was too late.

172
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
Vivi…

173
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,640
He threatened me not to say a word

174
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,080
and to never change my testimony.

175
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
Or he'll come for me too.

176
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,120
For the past ten years,
I have been living in fear.

177
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
You deserved it.

178
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,120
Are you still in contact with the suspect?

179
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,840
He changed his name, phone number,
and everything else to disappear.

180
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,880
I've asked someone to check
for his new name and his whereabouts.

181
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,640
It's been ten years.

182
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,520
I didn't expect
this opportunity to arise again,

183
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,240
the opportunity which
that nightmare would return.

184
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,960
Four, why are you standing here?

185
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,480
Wa…

186
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm so sorry that Vivi's gone.

188
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,720
Huh?

189
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,320
I asked someone
to find out Ekkachai's new identity.

190
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,640
But what I learned was more than that.

191
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,920
His old name was Sak.

192
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,200
He was the one who ran over my father.

193
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,040
Back then,

194
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,200
he was my father's driver
until he got fired.

195
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,000
He was angry and wanted revenge…

196
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,320
so he killed my father.

197
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
And that day at the apartment,

198
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,400
I think his intention was to find me.

199
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,080
He was looking for me, Wa.

200
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,920
But…

201
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,680
But he hurt Vivi.

202
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
Wa…

203
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,120
It's because that room belongs to me.

204
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,360
Don't blame yourself, it's not your fault.

205
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,720
Not at all.

206
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,440
Four…

208
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,240
It's okay, it's fine.

209
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,360
JARAVI PIENGPRADABKWAN

210
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
Is that…

211
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,360
Wa, wait here.

212
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,800
Wait!

213
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,360
Hey, why are you running?

214
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,600
Uncle! Hey!

215
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,760
Dad?

216
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,560
I tried my best
to look after you and Vivi from afar.

217
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
Why did you to lie to us…

218
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,800
that you were gone?

219
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,720
Did something happen?

220
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,360
I just thought

221
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,280
that I cannot stay
and take care of you guys.

222
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
What did you say?

223
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,600
Do you know what we've been through?

224
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,120
I didn't want to leave you guys…

225
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,440
but I thought if I left,

226
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,760
it would be good for you two.

227
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,720
What's good about being orphans?

228
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,800
You're selfish.

229
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,680
How could you do this to us?

230
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,200
I thought that this time…

231
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,920
Vivi might not have died.

232
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,440
This time?

233
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
Wa, I have an errand to run.

234
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
I'll pick you up later.

235
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,960
Okay.

236
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,360
Goodbye.

237
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,800
You said "this time",

238
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,040
does it mean that there are other times?

239
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,560
Did you turn back the time?

240
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,120
But no matter how much I tried
to turn back the time and protect Vivi,

241
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,400
in the end, I couldn't save her.

242
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,080
Vivi!

243
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,920
Vivi!

244
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,960
Vivi! Wake up, Vivi!

245
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
I'm here now.

246
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,960
I turned back the time
to prevent this incident from happening.

247
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
Hello, Wa.

248
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
Although she was safe from that incident,

249
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,040
she had to face another one instead.

250
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,480
Dad.

251
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,880
- Come here now!
- Dad! No!

252
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,400
Get inside! Stay inside!

253
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,680
- Stay there!
- Dad!

254
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,240
Dad! Open the door!

255
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,920
Why are you locking me in here?

256
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
It's best you stay there.

257
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
I don't want to!

258
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,840
But no matter how many times
I tried to turn back time

259
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,920
to prevent Vivi from being in danger,

260
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,040
it seemed like I pushed her

261
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,760
- into a greater danger somehow.
- Let me out!

262
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Dad!

263
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,480
What is it, Wa?

264
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,320
Vivi…

265
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,880
She was in a car crash.

266
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,160
That's impossible, she was just…

267
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,120
Vi!

268
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,920
Back then I thought
that I was responsible for her death.

269
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,560
So I turned back the time…

270
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Come here, baby.

271
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,600
…back to when she was born.

272
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,560
Wa, come take a photo with me.

273
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,320
Wa, please take care of your sister.

274
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,480
Okay.

275
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,560
And I walked away from your life.

276
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,520
But in the end…

277
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,560
it didn't change anything.

278
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,800
This time it will.

279
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,920
I know who the killer is.

280
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,520
Can you turn back the time
to the day Vivi was murdered?

281
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,640
I will take care of the killer
before he hurts Vivi.

282
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,920
This time she'll be safe

283
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,840
and we can finally be together.

284
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,040
Don't you get it?

285
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,960
Even if she's safe from that night,

286
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,720
eventually she will have to die
from some other incident.

287
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,120
But if you turn back the time…

288
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,040
Just stick to the present, Wa.

289
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,200
Things are going well for you,
aren't they?

290
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,720
Dad! We're talking about Vivi's life here.

291
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,080
But I'm talking about your life.

292
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,600
If you alter the past,

293
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,560
you might not end up like this.

294
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,240
But isn't it worth the change?
We will get Vivi back.

295
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,800
And what if the thing you have to change,

296
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,600
means you will have to lose Four instead?

297
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,040
I've noted down each of Vivi's incidents…

298
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,520
and tried to fix every single thing.

299
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,040
But there is one thing
that I cannot change,

300
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,160
which is the love of you and Four.

301
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,240
So what does it have to do
with Vivi's death?

302
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,560
Having Four in your life…

303
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,880
causes Vivi to be in danger.

304
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,000
She got ran over
because she was waiting for Four.

305
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,960
The car she was sitting in and crashed…

306
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,640
was the car from Four's house.

307
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,440
And this time,

308
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,480
the killer wanted to kill Four…

309
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,720
but he broke into the wrong apartment

310
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,200
and the one who died was your sister.

311
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,200
It's impossible to see
both the moon and the sun all at once.

312
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
No!

313
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,960
If this time you turn back the time

314
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,600
when I'm aware of what happened,

315
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,280
I could try everything

316
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,200
to save Vivi's life and Four.

317
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,360
A time traveler's lifespan
doesn't  reset with their time travel.

318
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,280
If I decide
to turn back the time once more,

319
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,920
it might be the last time

320
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,720
that I can afford to.

321
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,040
It's up to you, Wa.

322
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,760
You decide.

323
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,920
Think about it carefully.

324
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,520
Aren't you sleeping yet?

325
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,440
Are you tired today?
You can head to bed first.

326
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,800
I'd rather sit here with you.

327
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,120
Why didn't you ask me anything
about my dad?

328
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,800
You usually tell me what's on your mind,

329
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
unless it's something
you're uncomfortable with.

330
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,240
Then I don't want to ask.

331
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,040
What's going on, little bunny?

332
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,680
Four, you know me best.

333
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,480
What would I do without you?

334
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,720
Four, do you believe in magical powers?

335
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,680
Like when you can control the flow of time
and foresee the future.

336
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,080
The kind of future
when you were going to compete

337
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,640
in a track race
against the volleyball team

338
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,600
and break your leg again,

339
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,040
so I turned back the time
and begged you not to.

340
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,520
When you got ran over by a car
in front of the campus

341
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,360
I went back and saved you.

342
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,280
My family has magic powers.

343
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,720
My dad and I can control time…

344
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,920
and Vivi can foresee the future.

345
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,600
I can halt and turn back time.

346
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,720
But since Vivi's gone,
my power seems to have faded away.

347
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,480
Why did you decide to tell me all this?

348
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,840
I…

349
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,840
I guess it's because
I think about time halting,

350
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,280
and I wanted to use it

351
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,960
so that I can be with you
as long as I can.

352
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,040
Then let's halt the time together.

353
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,160
Regardless of
the gravitational force between us,

354
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,960
every time when we orbit into each other,

355
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,880
the inevitable tragedy emerges.

356
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,960
This time, I will go against my faith.

357
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,040
I will save Vivi's life,
along with having Four in my life.

358
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,880
I knew it.

359
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,160
The familiar feelings
that I have for you is real.

360
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,000
I wonder how we found each other
every time your dad used your power.

361
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,920
I guess you must have teased me like this,
like you always do.

362
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,640
And how are we going
to go against it next time?

363
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,720
I went and talked to your dad.

364
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
You should turn back the time.

365
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
Don't worry about me.

366
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,640
I know that…

367
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,800
I've been very good to Wa.

368
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,000
But what I can't give her is a family.

369
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,600
Please turn back the time.

370
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,040
I'll take care of the rest.

371
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,440
I know exactly how to fix everything now.

372
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,560
I know what to do…

373
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,120
in order to save Vivi's life.

374
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,280
I've told your dad to do what he must.

375
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,640
Four, I don't want that.

376
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,480
There must be another way,

377
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,200
where we can be together
without losing Vivi.

378
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,200
It's already been decided, Wa.

379
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,960
Our time is up.

380
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,320
I thought you said that
you'd always be with me forever.

381
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,720
Wa…

382
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,400
you'll be here…

383
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
right here with me always.

384
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,440
If we turned back the time
to the first day that we met,

385
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,880
would you still remember me?

386
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,120
Of course I would.

387
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,800
Because there is only one Jattawa
in this world.

388
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
Even if you can't remember me,

389
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,400
it's okay.

390
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,200
I will always be your natural satellite…

391
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,000
orbiting around you.

392
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,800
When is Dad going to turn back the time?

393
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,760
Right now.
