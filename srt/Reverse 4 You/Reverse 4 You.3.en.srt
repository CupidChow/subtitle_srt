1
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,480
Is Four back
at the apartment by now?

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,640
Let me go.

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,640
Come here, you!

4
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,000
- Four!
- Ten!

5
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,720
Let me go.

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,480
- Four!
- Let me go.

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,120
You little brat! You asked for it first!

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
So what?

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,720
You're such a loser.

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,480
That's why your leg--

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,040
Four…

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,280
You're gonna pay for this! Watch me!

13
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720
Let me go.

14
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,680
Let go.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
- What did you say?
- Four!

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,000
My leg?

17
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,000
Ten!

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
"Section 391."

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,960
"Whoever commits an act of violence
not amounting to bodily or mental harm

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,800
shall be imprisoned for
a maximum of one month

21
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,840
or fined 20,000 baht, or both."

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
Can you talk like a normal person?

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,040
That's how the law works.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,240
Are you saying that it's not normal?

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,960
If I don't understand, it means
it's not how normal people talk.

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,320
You could've committed a crime
under section 295

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,760
if you hurt her just now.

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Are you done?

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,600
No! You always
solve problems with violence.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,200
She was provoking you,
but you were worse.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,520
Please, enough.

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Why? Are you going to hurt me too?

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,480
So you think that
I always solve problems with violence?

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
Because you…

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,920
You're no different from the others.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,600
She was the one using violence,
but why did she make me feel guilty?

37
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
Isn't that confusing?

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Yeah. How come you feel guilty
for something that's not your fault?

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,240
I think that's unusual.

40
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,640
Hey, you should've seen
the look on her face.

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,760
I felt terrible.

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,240
Well, maybe it's because
you just got scolded by your soulmate.

43
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
Vivi!

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Just admit it,
you're having a crush on her.

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,440
But who would want
a grumpy soulmate like her?

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Not me, I'd rather be alone.

47
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
"You're such a loser!"

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,200
Hey! What did you just call me?
That's unacceptable.

49
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,160
I wasn't talking to you.

50
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Look!

51
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Isn't that Four's car?

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
- You asked for it first!
- So what?

53
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,480
You're such a loser.

54
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,560
You're gonna pay for this! Watch me!

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Let go!

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,200
Four must've been really mad at me.

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,040
What should I do?

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,760
Guess I'll have to apologize to her.

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
What are you doing, Vivi?

60
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
Are you sketching?

61
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,240
Hey, who's that?

62
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,280
I usually see his silhouette
following me around in my vision.

63
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,920
But in reality, I tried to look for him
whenever the moment came,

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,320
but I still can't figure out who he is.

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,960
But it didn't feel threatening to me.

66
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,240
Don't go around by yourself these days,
bring a friend with you.

67
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,360
And don't go to abandoned places too.

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,120
Okay.

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,600
You were saying something?

70
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,800
Vivi…

71
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,040
Yes?

72
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,720
Let's do it. Just say sorry.

73
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,360
Four…

74
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,080
Which laws are you reciting for me today?

75
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,960
Can you please talk nicely?

76
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,120
I just wanted to tell you
that I know about your car.

77
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,520
Do you still think
what I did to Ten was too much?

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,280
Sorry for judging you
before I know the whole story.

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,200
But you also have to apologize to me
for saying that I'm like the others.

81
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm not.

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
And why's that?

83
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,560
Four.

84
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,160
Let's go.

85
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,440
Is she your classmate?

86
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
- Yes.
- No.

87
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,120
I mean, I'm not in the same major as her.

88
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm studying law.

89
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,080
I studied law as well.

90
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,840
What year are you now?

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm a freshman.

92
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,960
Oh, you're still young.

93
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm a lawyer.
If you need any help, let me know.

94
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,960
Thank you for the offer, but I'm okay.

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,480
We should get going.

96
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,680
How good is it to have someone
giving you a ride when your car is broken?

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
His car must be very comfy.

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
What's wrong with you?

99
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm your soulmate.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,520
And I don't want you
to be intimate with someone else.

101
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,720
I know I'm just
a poor shabby freshman student.

102
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,760
How could I compete with this fancy lawyer

103
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,520
with an expensive car?

104
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm jealous.
Don't you get it that I'm jealous?

105
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
What?

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What a waste of my ability.

107
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,520
I'm a lawyer.
If you need any help, let me know.

108
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,120
Thanks.

109
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
We should get going.

110
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,880
See you later.

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,160
Don't they look good together?

112
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Who?

113
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,320
Four and Pak.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,080
She came from a wealthy family,
he's a famous lawyer.

115
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,040
Mr. Pakkhaphol
does a lot of cases for celebrities.

116
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,720
"If you need any help, let me know."

117
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,120
I don't need your help.

118
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,920
Wait until I graduate,
I'll be a more famous lawyer than him.

119
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,520
What's up with you, Wa?

120
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,840
Are you stressed
about the college representative contest?

121
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,760
Well… yes.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,280
Don't stress about it,
I'll be here for you.

123
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
What?

124
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
Huh?

125
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,640
I mean, you'll have us by your side
no matter what.

126
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,520
- I bet you're touched.
- Right.

127
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes…

128
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,320
That's Four. Why is she in a hurry?

129
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,040
Is she…

130
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,800
Ten! Come here!

131
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,320
Why the hell are you yelling?

132
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,480
I wanted to talk about the damages.

133
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
What damages?

134
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
This is absurd. It's too expensive.

135
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Just say you're sorry if you can't pay up.

136
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,920
How did you know that Ten was responsible?

137
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
By assuming?

138
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,400
Where's the evidence?

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,800
How about a witness?

140
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
I saw the whole thing.

141
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,960
Ten also admitted that she did it.

142
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,400
Remember me, Ten?

143
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,160
You only saw Four slap me.

144
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,440
You sprayed paint on her car!

145
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,920
You saw me do it?

146
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,200
No, but what was sprayed on her car
were the same words you said to her.

147
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
If you say that you have a witness,
I can say it too.

148
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,120
Because she was with me
the whole time on that day.

149
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,840
How did you know which day?
No one said anything.

150
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,840
There's no date of the incident
shown on the document,

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
only a repairing date.

152
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,600
Are you guys done arguing?

153
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,920
I can hear it from the inside.

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,720
So you heard the whole story?

155
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,520
Just tell your girl to apologize.

156
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,360
Ten, did you do what she said?

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,160
I didn't do it.

158
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,680
I would never lower myself
to argue with someone like her.

159
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,160
I think the rest of us
agree with me,

160
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,840
So who's the one
trying to get into trouble?

161
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,960
So this is your true color, Kie?

162
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,840
Kie, are you ignoring me as a witness?

163
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,560
Ten obviously dropped the spray can.

164
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Did Four force you to do this?

165
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,080
What do you mean?

166
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
Isn't it weird that a person
who almost everyone hates

167
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,960
got a freshman to defend her?

168
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,280
Has she threatened or assaulted you?

169
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,720
How could you think that?

170
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440
Have you assaulted someone
for your own benefit?

171
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,320
I was one of her victims.
Everybody knows it.

172
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,640
You must've seen the video, right?

173
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,800
But I haven't seen
what happened before that.

174
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
I actually wonder what the story was.

175
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
So why are you here again?

176
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
Well, it's up to you.

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
What do you want this to be?

178
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,960
Just say sorry and we're done?

179
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
Ten, apologize to her.

180
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
But, Kie--

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,800
Just say you're sorry.

182
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,400
I won't.

183
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,280
Then you guys work this out.

184
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,080
As for the rest of you,
get back to training.

185
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,600
So now that you're alone,
how do you want to do this?

186
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,000
No, I'll never apologize to you.

187
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,760
Fine, then I'll bring my witness
and footage of the incident to the police.

188
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll see you at the police station.

189
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,920
Fine, I'm sorry.

190
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,200
Post your apology online
for ten days straight.

191
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,600
If I see you skip a single post,
you better be ready to pay up.

192
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Let's go, Wa.

193
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,960
Why didn't you tell me
about the footage?

194
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,800
I was arguing the whole time.

195
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,720
There's no footage.
The car wasn't running.

196
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,800
That's true. You're so sneaky.

197
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,960
Is this what you meant,
that you're unlike the others?

198
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,480
That's not what I meant.

199
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,200
Actually, I'm afraid…

200
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,240
that I won't get a chance
to know the real you.

201
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,480
Don't you have a lot of secrets?

202
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
Why do you want to know?

203
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
Don't answer me with a question.

204
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
That's annoying.

205
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
- Can you please talk nicely?
- No.

206
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
Well, I'm sorry.

207
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,520
But after this,
the volleyball team probably hates you.

208
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,000
Me?

209
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,640
Could you not speak so bluntly to me?

210
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,320
You were calling me Wa back in the gym.

211
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,480
Now that we're on the same boat.

212
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,960
Can we talk a little more intimately?

213
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,200
We'll call it as a thank you to me.

214
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Let me buy you dinner
and call that a thank you.

215
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,440
Can't you just call me…

216
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,640
Did you just ask me out to dinner?

217
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,200
What do you say?

218
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,880
I can't today.

219
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Hey, are you playing hard to get?

220
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,280
I've got work to do.

221
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,520
I should get going.

222
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,240
Wa, you're the one who said no.
Don't say I didn't ask.

223
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,520
What did you just call me?

224
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,640
You already heard it.

225
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,160
Right. Yes, that was good.

226
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,680
I really can't today.

227
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,640
But if you really want to,
you can buy me some groceries instead.

228
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,560
See you!

229
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
Okay.

230
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm almost home, Wa.

231
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Have a good day at work!

232
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,560
Okay, bye.

233
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
Wa!

234
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,440
- Yes?
- Are you having a party in your room?

235
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,080
I don't think so.

236
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,360
Really?

237
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,040
I saw Vivi come back with someone,
thought there's a special occasion.

238
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,280
What did you say?

239
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,880
I saw his silhouette
following me around in my vision.

240
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,720
What's up with her?

241
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,120
Vivi!

242
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,040
Are you hurt? Are you all right, Vivi?

243
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm fine.

244
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,440
I just spilled some sauce on my shirt.

245
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,400
Ying told me that you're…

246
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,840
Uncle came.

247
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,640
Uncle?

248
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,160
He's over there.

249
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I was trying to call you,
but it got disconnected.

250
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, my phone died.

251
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,400
So, Uncle, what are you doing here?

252
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,960
As promised, I've brought you
500,000 baht from selling the house.

253
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,320
I thought you were going to disappear.

254
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,720
Mr. Somkiat hasn't paid me in full,
but I decided to give it to you first.

255
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,560
Is this considered another favor?

256
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,560
Wa, I've told you that I had no choice.

257
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,360
If my dad was still alive,
would you do the same?

258
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,040
I tried to bring you the money as fast as
I could, all because of your dad.

259
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Well, thanks a lot.

260
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,880
Now that it's done,
we don't have to see each other again.

261
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Something seems off, I felt like
he didn't want to give us the money.

262
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,520
But he followed me here
and asked me how we're doing.

263
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
So the silhouette that you saw?

264
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,160
Yes, it was him.

265
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,480
That's a relief.

266
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,400
I'll be fine, don't you worry.

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,480
It was a good timing that Uncle showed up.

268
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,840
Otherwise we wouldn't have money
to get the bike back.

269
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,440
I agree.

270
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,560
I haven't been working much lately.

271
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,360
- We also have to minimize our spending.
- That's fine.

272
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,760
Well then, can you give me money
to buy a drawing tablet?

273
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

274
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,400
A drawing tablet, it's 2,500 baht.

275
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,000
Vivi, although 500,000 baht
is a lot of money,

276
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,880
we must spend it wisely

277
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
on our rents and other essentials.

278
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,640
And after I graduate in three years,
I'll be a lawyer.

279
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,160
I'll get us a lot more money then.

280
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,680
I'll use it for my drawings
and we can sell them.

281
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,360
I hear they pay good money.

282
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,840
Is it worth your time
just to earn few hundred baht?

283
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,640
It's 1,000 baht per drawing.

284
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,920
All right, why not.

285
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,800
So generous, just like your soulmate!

286
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,840
Hey…

287
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,240
Thank you so much.

288
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm not like Four.

289
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,480
What's wrong with being me?

290
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,080
Hi, Four.

291
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,920
This is Vivi, my younger sister.

292
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,000
Well, I'll head up to my room now,
you guys enjoy.

293
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
See you later.

294
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,880
Are you sleeping well these days?

295
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,440
Huh?

296
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,960
I haven't seen you on the rooftop lately.

297
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,560
Have you been working a lot?

298
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,440
I work less now.
I have more time for you to buy me dinner.

299
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,240
It's too late.

300
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,880
What do you mean?
It's just 2:00 p.m.

301
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,240
So this is what she meant.

302
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,160
Oh, look at all these fancy groceries, Wa.

303
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,960
The rice is organic,
plus the instant noodles are premium too!

304
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Look.

305
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,040
She really did it.

306
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm off to bed now.

307
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,440
Okay, I'll probably stay up late reading.

308
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,880
You go to sleep first.

309
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,200
Okay, goodnight.

310
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Goodnight.

311
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,960
You think you can trick your sister
who can see the future?

312
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,440
Wrong move, sister.

313
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,480
You came.

314
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,640
Well, I can't sleep.

315
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,200
So, have you filed the curator request
at the court yet?

316
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,520
No, I haven't.

317
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,360
But didn't you already have a lawyer?

318
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,000
A famous one too.

319
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,280
Pak is Waran's lawyer.

320
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,680
She's my step-mother.

321
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,480
Do you think
I wanted to work with him?

322
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,560
But as of now,
I'll be you legal counsellor.

323
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,920
Also free of charge.

324
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,680
If I wanted to
file an application at court

325
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,320
in order to recognize someone
as incapacitated,

326
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,560
will that be ungrateful?

327
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,920
If that person really has
a dementia condition,

328
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,200
I think you're doing the right thing.

329
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,800
My grandmother is starting
to lose some of her memory.

330
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,000
What she remembers is a grandson,
who is a child of her daughter-in-law.

331
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,040
And a granddaughter
who was born from her son's mistress.

332
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,800
It's you.

333
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,840
She prepared the inheritance for them.

334
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,800
Then, she did the right thing.

335
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,480
But what if her grandson
isn't really related to her?

336
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,440
I took my father's and brother's DNA
to get them checked once.

337
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,640
The result shows that they aren't related.

338
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
My grandmother kept that result.

339
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,600
But now she's losing her memory…

340
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,280
and things are in Waran's favor.

341
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,080
So should we get the DNA tested again?

342
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,600
Five years ago,

343
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,720
my dad died in a car accident.

344
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm so sorry to hear that.

345
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,600
My grandmother is the only one
who loved and accepted me for who I am.

346
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,680
but I'm about to file a court request…

347
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,160
to recognize her as an incapacitated.

348
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,080
Four, that's not true.
You're not being ungrateful.

349
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,800
In fact, you're protecting her.

350
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,200
Your stepmother is an outsider.

351
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,520
Her son as well.

352
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,080
You have the right
to inherit everything,

353
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,280
because it's supposed to be yours.

354
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,800
You look at me the same way
you begged me not to run in that race.

355
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,000
Then why did you tell me this story?

356
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,080
I don't know.

357
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,360
Maybe because
the moon is beautiful tonight.

358
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,680
So I got carried away.

359
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,200
Oh, you're right. It's beautiful!

360
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,320
Too bad I can only look at it,
but I cannot have it.

361
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
Can I help you?

362
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,840
Yes, sure.

363
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,760
Looking for a present for your lover?

364
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
Well…

365
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,840
Oh, found it.

366
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,520
Is this the one?

367
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Yes.

368
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,200
Can you gift wrap it for me?

369
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,080
Yes, absolutely.
Do you want to write any note?

370
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,280
Hi, Khun.

371
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,600
Where are you?
The photoshoot is about to start.

372
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,080
Okay, I'm on my way. See you.

373
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,120
- Hurry.
- Bye.

374
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,400
Meet at the lobby at 9 p.m.

375
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,400
I'll buy you dinner
as a thank you for last night.

376
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,080
Yes, Pak.

377
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,720
Today?

378
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,040
I totally forgot.

379
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,000
It's okay I'll get there by myself.

380
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,960
Where is it again?

381
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,520
Hold on a second.

382
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,720
"Sushi Hiro" at 9:00 p.m.

383
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,000
Okay.

384
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,000
See you then.

385
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,320
Sorry, somethIng came up
I have to take a rain check

386
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,320
- Miss Ying.
- Yes?

387
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,800
Please give this to Jattawa.

388
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
My pleasure.

389
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,840
And this note too.

390
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,760
Okay.

391
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,280
Thank you so much, Ying.

392
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,720
You're welcome.

393
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,840
Wa.

394
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Yes?

395
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,640
Four left you something.

396
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Here.

397
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,120
Thank you.

398
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,320
You're welcome.

399
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,960
"I remember you said that the Moon
was beautiful but you can't have it,

400
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,680
so I got you one."

401
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,040
Why aren't you dressed yet?

402
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,960
Your dinner's at 9:00 p.m.
It's 7:00 p.m. now.

403
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,880
No, you're right!

404
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,440
You better put on your prettiest dress,
it's your first date.

405
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,680
I know. Is this one pretty?

406
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,800
I was walking by the florist shop
and thought of you.

407
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,000
Here.

408
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,520
Four…

409
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,400
Wa.

410
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,000
How did you get here?

411
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,719
Well, I got the note that you left me.

412
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,639
Hey.

413
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
That's not it.

414
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,800
- It's not…
- Four, it's fine.

415
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,719
I misunderstood.

416
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,320
No, I came to dinner with…

417
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,120
I'm sorry for interrupting.

418
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,400
Wa…

419
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,920
Excuse me.

420
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,719
Hello, Khun.

421
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,199
Wa, are you free?
Can you meet me at the faculty?

422
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,560
Yes, sure.

423
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,639
I hope you like the food, Mother.

424
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,560
The fish here is very fresh.

425
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,880
Hey, that song was really nice.

426
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,720
Why do you look so sad?

427
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,840
You asked me to come
and watch you practice for the contest,

428
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
so I'm acting like a judge.

429
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,000
So, does the judge have any comments?

430
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,080
I think it's pretty good.

431
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,240
Lots of girls would vote for you.

432
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,720
In fact I have another song,

433
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,520
I've never played it
in front of anyone before.

434
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Can you tell me
whether you like it or not?

435
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,520
Sure, let's do it.

436
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,320
Is Jattawa here?

437
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,920
She's watching her friend
rehearse something at the faculty.

438
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,280
Didn't you guys have a date?

439
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,560
Thank you so much.

440
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,160
Okay. I think you should…

441
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,680
What's up with these two?

442
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,840
They should've had
each other's phone numbers by now.

443
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,800
Four…

444
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,520
Pick up!

445
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,840
It felt strange in my heart
Since the first time that we met

446
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,240
But I never really figured out why

447
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,240
And when time passes by

448
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,760
And let the time pass by

449
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,600
The feeling started to be certain

450
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,360
Because the law of the universe
Can't withstand

451
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,640
All these countless stars
Amongst an endless land that gravitates me

452
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,720
And pushes me to tell you
What I have in mind today

453
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,040
Can you let me be by your side

454
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,880
Always and forever

455
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,960
I wanted to see your smile all the time

456
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,640
If one day you are down

457
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,600
I'll be there to comfort you

458
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm willing to orbit around you forever

459
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,000
And will always be your secondary star

460
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,640
How was it?

461
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,800
This song has such a deep meaning.

462
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,360
What if I wanted to play it just for you,

463
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,280
would you like it?

464
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,640
Well…

465
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,320
Your voice is really nice.

466
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,760
What I meant is…

467
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,280
Do you like me?

468
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,520
Not as a friend.

469
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,720
Well, I don't really know
when it happened.

470
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
But then…

471
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,800
I realized…

472
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,600
I don't want to be
just your friend anymore.

473
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,040
Is it possible if--

474
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,200
Khun!

475
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,480
Don't say it, please.

476
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,520
Okay.

477
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,040
What have I done?

478
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120
That was embarrassing.

479
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,320
But whatever, it's already been said.

480
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,920
Anyway, we can't turn back the time,
can we?

481
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,040
Yes, we can.

482
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,800
I have another song.
I've never played it--

483
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,120
Khun, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Next time, Okay? with Top too.

484
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
It's only just a few minutes.

485
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
VI

486
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,560
Hello, Vivi.

487
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,480
Wa! Four's about to get hit by a car.
Go help her now, hurry!

488
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,360
Wa!

489
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,760
Four!

490
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,120
Help!

491
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,400
Somebody please help!

492
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,360
Can you hear me, Four?

493
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,280
Please help!

494
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,760
Turn back the time, Jattawa.

495
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
Please turn back!

496
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,440
Please turn back!
