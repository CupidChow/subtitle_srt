1
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
Is she really my soulmate?

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,280
And last night we also…

3
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
No! What am I thinking?

4
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,960
Oh, my God! What is she doing?

5
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,680
Wait!

6
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
Where did she go?

7
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,520
Is she feeling shy?

8
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
She wasn't like this last night.

9
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
Jattawa,
your thoughts are getting too dirty!

10
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Will this be enough for Four?

11
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,640
We sure used a lot of energy last night.

12
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,680
You're just in time…

13
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
Who were you expecting?

14
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
Vivi…

15
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,320
I was waiting for you.

16
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,960
I never said that I would come
and get my stuff this morning.

17
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,480
I… had a feeling.

18
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,600
Who's the other plate for?

19
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,640
Oh… It's mine.

20
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm starving, so I made two plates.

21
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,880
I thought that it was for Four
after your night together.

22
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
I saw what happened last night
in my vision. See you!

23
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
She saw it all…

24
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,520
Was that a dream?

25
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,520
If I run into Four, how should I react?

26
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,400
No, no. I'll look too excited.

27
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,080
Or should I…

28
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,120
Why am I acting tough? Then…

29
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,080
A friendly smile. That seems so fake.

30
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,400
Whatever. I'll figure it out
when I meet her.

31
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,400
Four.

32
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,280
You seem so happy to see me.

33
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,040
How about it? You want to go grab a bite?

34
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,840
Well… Should we go eat
at the Business Faculty building?

35
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
I'm good with that.

36
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
- Okay.
- Let's go.

37
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,520
Wa, who are you looking for?

38
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,840
What? I'm not looking for anyone.

39
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Just looking to see what I should eat.

40
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,720
We're almost done eating
and you still haven't decided?

41
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,840
Well, I'm still browsing.
I'm not that hungry yet.

42
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,280
If you're not hungry,
why did you ask us to eat here?

43
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Oh…

44
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Are you free this evening?

45
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,440
Would you like it?

46
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,960
What I mean is…

47
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
do you like me?

48
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,880
Not as friends.

49
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
Or is he going to do that again?

50
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,920
I think you should go with Top instead.

51
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Me? Why me?

52
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,880
You guys go together.

53
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,160
Then that's the plan.

54
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
- So I can…
- Khun!

55
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
We're friends.

56
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,919
…register my name…

57
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,360
Register? Register for what?

58
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,559
It's for our college
representation contest. Remember?

59
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,760
Yeah. Khun's senior got him a spot.

60
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,960
So he wanted to bring you along.

61
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh… right, right.

62
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,440
What was that?
You said something about "friends".

63
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,120
Oh, I mean…

64
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,840
What I meant was we're friends, right?

65
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,560
And if there's anything about the contest,
please let me know.

66
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,080
What a coincidence!
We were talking about the same thing.

67
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,160
Then I guess this evening--

68
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I…

69
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,280
I haven't really figured out
what my show is going to be.

70
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
You can go ahead without me today.

71
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,920
I'm going to the restroom now.

72
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,320
Four.

73
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,480
Are you here for lunch?

74
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes.

75
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,520
Thank you so much for
taking me back to my room last night.

76
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
Oh…

77
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
Do you remember anything from last night…

78
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,000
I was really drunk last night.
I'm sorry for that.

79
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,320
I should get going.

80
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,520
Wait a second.

81
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,640
Are you ignoring
everything from last night?

82
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,640
What's up?

83
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,760
Well…

84
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,360
I'm participating in a college
representative contest this Friday.

85
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,720
If you're free, please come.

86
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,520
Okay.

87
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,760
Wa, please concentrate on your rehearsal.

88
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,640
You're going up on the stage
for the contest.

89
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
Just in case Four swings by.

90
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,240
I don't think she'll come.

91
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,800
She's been acting cold to me.

92
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,000
Did she say anything
about what happened last night?

93
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,320
She did, but it was
only about how drunk she was.

94
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,120
Maybe she was too drunk
to remember anything?

95
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I don't think so.

96
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,160
When we were fooling around,

97
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,400
she didn't seem that drunk.

98
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,120
Right!

99
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,920
You two were fooling around!

100
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,280
Why can't she remember anything?

101
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Is it because it wasn't
that memorable for her?

102
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,720
Or was it that bad?

103
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,520
What do you expect?
I've never done it before.

104
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,800
Hey! Wa!

105
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,800
That was amazing!
You'll win the contest for sure!

106
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
Haven't you already
seen this trick before?

107
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,080
Well, I would be very excited
if I saw it for the first time.

108
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,280
Isn't that right?

109
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,720
If it's the first time,
it would be thrilling.

110
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
Come on, don't hold a grudge against Four.

111
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,280
She might think that it's a common thing
that happens in a relationship.

112
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
No way, it can't be normal.

113
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,960
It was…

114
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,920
It was…

115
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,400
my first time.

116
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,800
Or it wasn't her first time?

117
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,480
She must have been through quite a few!

118
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,360
Wait! Where are you going?

119
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm going to talk to her!

120
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Hey! Calm down first!

121
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
Oh…

122
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,280
- Oh.
- Ying.

123
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,320
Yes?

124
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,400
What were you doing in Four's room?

125
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,720
Well… I…

126
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,200
My duty is to take care of this building.

127
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,120
That's why I was in her room.

128
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay.

129
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,000
Are you jealous of Ying?

130
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,920
So what's wrong with her room?
Why did you have come take a look?

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,560
She forgot to turn off the lights
so I turned it off for her.

132
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,560
She's not sleeping here tonight.

133
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
I have to go.

134
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay.

135
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Well, let's go back to our room.

136
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,920
Isn't it odd that she's decided
not to stay here tonight?

137
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,840
She must be avoiding me.

138
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,200
Guys, I'm excited!
The contest is today.

139
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
What about you, Wa?
Have you prepared for the show?

140
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
Wa…

141
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
Wa!

142
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,760
What?

143
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,240
Guys,

144
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,920
what if A & B were intimate together
for the first time

145
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,720
and then the next day
A went to meet B,

146
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,240
but B acted like nothing happened.

147
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,520
What would you guys do if you were A?

148
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,200
I see, online gossip, right?

149
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,160
I guess it means B doesn't want
to be involved with A anymore.

150
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,440
A shouldn't be worried anymore
and move on with her life.

151
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm sure
there's someone better for her.

152
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,160
If B really cares about A,
B wouldn't leave A worried like this.

153
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,040
I agree.

154
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,640
I think you should tell A
to accept it and move on.

155
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Hey! Why aren't you dressed up?

156
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,880
We're here for the contest.

157
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,240
What's wrong with my dress?

158
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,360
It's not like I'm going to win anyway.

159
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Come with me, we still have time.

160
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
- Where are we going?
- To get you something to wear.

161
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,680
Here, try this one.

162
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
This dress?

163
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,440
Hey, hold on!

164
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Are you going to change right here?

165
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,800
Why not? Are you going to take a peek?

166
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,160
Are you crazy?

167
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,600
I guess it's okay
since you'll be watching the door for me.

168
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,120
Yeah, sure, do your thing.

169
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,400
Honestly, I don't really need
to dress up for it.

170
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
I'm not going to win anyway.

171
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,520
Why do you think like that?

172
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not as pretty nor talented
compared to the others.

173
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,240
There's nothing outstanding about me.

174
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,240
Do we have to be like the others
in order to win?

175
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,160
People are all different,

176
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,680
which makes us special in our own ways.

177
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,680
I think…

178
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,960
if someone gets to know
who you really are,

179
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
they will definitely like you.

180
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,040
Just like how I feel about you.

181
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,280
Khun…

182
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,280
Can we keep our friendship
like this forever?

183
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,839
I like being your friend.

184
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
I don't want anything to change that.

185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,040
Do you want to think about it?

186
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,680
You don't have to give me the answer now.

187
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,560
But I really feel that way.

188
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,880
The fact that you don't
want our relationship to change is…

189
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
because you have feelings…

190
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
for someone else?

191
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,800
Is it Four?

192
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,880
Hey, I'm sorry.

193
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,640
No, it's fine.

194
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,640
You didn't do anything wrong.

195
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Yes, I did, a big one.

196
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
I said something to Four earlier.

197
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,720
I've told her how I feel

198
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,800
and the fact that we're still close
means that she feels the same way.

199
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,320
You shouldn't
make her feel uncomfortable.

200
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm really sorry.

201
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,480
I had no right to talk to Four
and confuse her like that.

202
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,120
Now that you know what I did.

203
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,520
Do you still want to be my friend?

204
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,160
Please stand by, Khun. You're next.

205
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,480
Hey! Why are you making such a sad face?

206
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,720
Come on, give me a smile!

207
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,200
I don't want to see my friend
looking ugly on stage.

208
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,120
I can still be your friend?

209
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,200
Of course. I told you that
I want us to be friends forever.

210
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,160
We all make mistakes.

211
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
Don't worry about it.

212
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
Thank you so much. And…

213
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm sorry again.

214
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,680
Huh? What was that? I didn't hear it!

215
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,040
You're getting greedy!

216
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,400
Finally! This is more like you.

217
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,640
Coming up next,

218
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,040
a representative from the faculty of law

219
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,720
whom the ladies are waiting for!

220
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,960
It's Khun!

221
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,360
Break a leg, Khun.

222
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,760
If Khun talked to Four about that,

223
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,760
then why hasn't she asked me about it?

224
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,680
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,800
And our next contender,

226
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,080
she's a representative
from the faculty of law…

227
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,440
Jattawa!

228
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Jattawa!

229
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,640
You're really not coming?

230
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,200
This trick is mind-blowing.
Wait for it!

231
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,760
- Are you watching?
- Yes.

232
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,200
Four must be upset about Khun.
That's why she's avoiding me.

233
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,800
Or it's not really about him?

234
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,640
Perhaps the reason
might be much simpler than that.

235
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,400
She might not feel the same way as me.

236
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,360
Then stop thinking about her, Jattawa.

237
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,360
She's not even interested
to come see you perform.

238
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,600
What?

239
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
That's it?

240
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,400
All right, everyone.

241
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,600
We will know who will be
our representatives in just a moment.

242
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:54,320
Each rose in your hands
will decide who will be the winner.

243
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,120
Feel free to give them
to your preferred representative.

244
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Thank you so much!

245
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,680
Could you pass it to Pie
from the finance department?

246
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,720
Okay.

247
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,040
You're Pie, right?

248
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,160
Someone gave this flower for you.

249
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,360
Who's this for?

250
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,760
They're for you.

251
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,720
I didn't know you did magic.

252
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,880
Did you make it on time?

253
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,280
You invited me, didn't you?

254
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,880
I thought you didn't care.

255
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,040
Did you like magic show?

256
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,440
No…

257
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,160
But I like you.

258
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I'd like you to be my special person.

259
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,600
Am I the reason that we're going home?

260
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Well, I'm free now.

261
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,600
In case you have to
go celebrate with Khun.

262
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,640
Four.

263
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,520
He told me all about it,
about what he said to you.

264
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,840
And he apologized for lying to you.

265
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,680
It's not true at all.
I don't like him in that way.

266
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,040
I got drunk for nothing…

267
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,200
You mean on that night?

268
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Yeah…

269
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,240
Do you… really like me?

270
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,480
Yes. How about you? How do you feel?

271
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,200
I…

272
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,840
You… don't feel the same way?

273
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,680
I mean…

274
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,840
I can't have feelings for someone
who's interested in many people.

275
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,680
Maybe it's true that you like me,

276
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,880
but you also have feelings
for other people.

277
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,000
That person you gave
your messaging-ID to.

278
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,720
Did you receive the lamp that I got you?

279
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,680
What's this?

280
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,080
It's a lamp.

281
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
What is it for?

282
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,960
Hey! Stop messing with me.

283
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,920
Answer me.

284
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,840
To provide light.

285
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,320
Why don't you turn it on?

286
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,600
- I…
- Go on.

287
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
Fine, I'll turn it on.

288
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,720
What you said about giving
your messaging-ID to the person you like.

289
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,680
What you meant was…

290
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,800
Yes, I meant to give it to you
a long time ago.

291
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,280
How long could it have really been?

292
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,000
Since the first day that we met.

293
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,160
But I didn't know how to act
so I said something stupid instead.

294
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,800
What are you looking at?

295
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,840
I just knew that the feeling I had
is a familiar one.

296
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,040
It's okay, Dao. I'll go.

297
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
Okay.

298
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
And I wanted to be with you again.

299
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,800
You're always full of surprises,

300
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,240
and I didn't know what it was

301
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,320
that made me care about you so much.

302
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Where am I supposed to live now?

303
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,800
I was worried and concerned about you.

304
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,480
Be careful, Ying.

305
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
Did you text Jattawa about my vacant room?

306
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,840
Yes, I did. A vacant room
with a really good deal.

307
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,600
Too good. As if it's free.

308
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,080
If I could, I would've made it free.

309
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,720
I didn't know what it was.

310
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,800
You can just write
your own message in here.

311
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,240
- Okay.
- So I was sure that

312
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,280
what I feel for you is stronger

313
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,880
than what I felt for others.

314
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,600
Then after that night,

315
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,680
why didn't you come back to your room?

316
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,920
Were you avoiding me?

317
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,280
That day, I had to be with my grandmother,

318
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,960
so I had to go home.

319
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,520
Oh…

320
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,920
But actually…

321
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,800
I also tried to avoid you.

322
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,880
Oh. Why?

323
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,120
Have I done something wrong?

324
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,920
Not at all.

325
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,320
You haven't done anything wrong.

326
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,600
In fact, everything was so good…

327
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,560
it felt like a dream.

328
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,200
Dream? How could it be?

329
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,880
Wait!

330
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,120
Did you say "dream"?

331
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:03,000
Well… I dream about us doing it often.

332
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,320
What are you saying?

333
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,360
You just casually talk about this stuff?

334
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,560
Well, why can't I?

335
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,480
This time you're actually with me.

336
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
Four!

337
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,520
Well, I've gotten everything off my chest.

338
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,480
So are we good?

339
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,840
How about you? What do you think?

340
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,600
I added you.

341
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Wa!

342
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,360
Look at that!

343
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,080
Wow! Shooting stars!

344
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,720
Come on, make a wish!

345
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,040
Please be my girlfriend.

346
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,160
An "X"?

347
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,640
Is that a no?

348
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,600
It's a plus sign,
the meaning of my name.

349
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,880
I wrote my name on you.

350
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
Now you're mine.

351
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,520
You can't change your mind.

352
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,000
Then…

353
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,120
let me make you mine as well.

354
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,600
I wish the night wouldn't end so soon.

355
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,880
Maybe Vivi can sleep over in my room?

356
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,040
Four…

357
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,159
Or you can come over to mine instead.

358
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,239
What are you saying?

359
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,719
Oh, the CCTV on our floor…

360
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,520
It's broken, right?

361
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Yes. No one has come and fixed it yet.

362
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,400
Four, someone will see us!

363
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,040
No one will see us.

364
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,000
That's enough. I'm going now.

365
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
Four. Why are you standing here?

366
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,160
Wa…

367
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,320
I'm so sorry.

368
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,440
I'm sorry that I'm the reason Vivi's gone.

369
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,640
What?
