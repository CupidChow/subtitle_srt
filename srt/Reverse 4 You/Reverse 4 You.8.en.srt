1
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,800
If we turned back the time
to the first day that we met,

2
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,000
would you still remember me?

3
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,200
Of course I would.

4
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,200
Because there is only one Jattawa
in this world.

5
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,080
You must save Vivi's life, Wa.

6
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Vi.

7
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,960
It can't be.

8
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
Dad's already turned the time back.

9
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,240
Vi!

10
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Vi! Vi!

11
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
Vi!

12
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,520
Vi…

13
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,360
Yes?

14
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,440
Vi!

15
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,960
You're back.

16
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,640
- Don't leave me again.
- What's wrong?

17
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
I was gone for less than five minutes.

18
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Don't ever leave me again.

19
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,400
I won't let you.

20
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,120
Vi!

21
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,000
Vi…

22
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,320
Is there something on my face?

23
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,560
Nothing.

24
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Are you losing your mind
over your interview exam tomorrow?

25
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,040
Don't worry about it, Wa.
Everything will be fine.

26
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,960
In fact, there's something
more important than that.

27
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,600
You are going to
meet your soulmate tomorrow,

28
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,360
and it will be snowing in Bangkok too.

29
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,480
You think that I made it up?

30
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,280
It's true, what you saw in your vision.

31
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
Huh?

32
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,120
How are you so easily convinced?

33
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,040
It will really snow in Bangkok?

34
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
Yes.

35
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,480
Is this really you, Wa?

36
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,280
I've got something to tell you.

37
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
Whose house is this, Wa?

38
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,200
Wa, is this our dad?

39
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
Yes.

40
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
"If you're reading this letter,

41
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
I wanted to let you know
that I'm happy to see you again, Wa."

42
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
"Even though I didn't get to see you, Vi,

43
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm still happy

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,440
knowing that you will be
living your life once again."

45
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,720
"I'm sorry for not being able
to take care of you two."

46
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,320
"I thought that I would be able
to change my own destiny,

47
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,160
but in the end, all I could do
was to go back to the beginning."

48
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,760
"I want you to make the most
of this opportunity."

49
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,520
"Even though I'll miss
watching you two grow up,

50
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:04,040
I know you'll love
and care for each other deeply."

51
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,200
"I love you two very much,
and always will."

52
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,520
"This is my final gift to you."

53
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,600
It was him,

54
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,159
the figure that followed me
in the shadows in my visions.

55
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,679
It was Dad all along.

56
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,080
He sacrificed everything
and turned back the time just to save me.

57
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,240
Vi…

58
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
You're the reason…

59
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,840
why Dad lived until his last day.

60
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,560
Do you know that?

61
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,560
Wa, what are we going to do with that?

62
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,520
A will? what will?

63
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,920
Wow, I left you a message
less than an hour ago.

64
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,760
What's the rush?
You must be really scared.

65
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,840
When your father died,
he didn't leave you with any will.

66
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,080
He gave me this house and the place
he lived in before he passed away to me.

67
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm thinking about selling that place
and will give you 500,000 baht.

68
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,080
It might not be as much as what you
expected to get from selling this house.

69
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,160
But I think it's a fair compensation
as a thank you for taking care of us.

70
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
And we don't have to see each other again.

71
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,560
Wa…

72
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,400
Trust me on this, it's for the best.

73
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,280
So you won't have to
be judged as a greedy, hateful person.

74
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,360
You should leave now.

75
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,280
Wa, was he really going to sell our house?

76
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,600
I can't believe it.

77
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
It's fine, Vi.

78
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,240
I'll fix everything this time.

79
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,240
You're going to
meet your soulmate tomorrow.

80
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm not going to see her.

81
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
Wa!

82
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,600
Did you call the pizza place
for a sick leave this afternoon?

83
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,040
Is everything all right?

84
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
I was just lazy.

85
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,920
You're Jattawa Piengpradabkwan,
there's no way that you're lazy.

86
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,960
Or if you took the job,
you'll run into Four.

87
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,200
Four…

88
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,880
Do you think there is other way

89
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,400
that you can finally be together?

90
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,240
And you as well.

91
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,560
We can't turn back the time again.

92
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,680
And if something goes wrong,

93
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,160
I can't live with the fact
that I'll have to lose you again.

94
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,680
From now on,
I can only be Four's natural satellite,

95
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,120
just orbiting around her.

96
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,840
They know each other?

97
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
I'll have to send this to Four
so she can look into it.

98
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,680
How should I send it to her?

99
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,280
MRS. WARAN MIGHT BE UP TO SOMETHING

100
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,360
Those who have entered the event
can come join this activity

101
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,560
in order to win Johnny Kim pillows,
our presenter.

102
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,040
Please join us in this booth.

103
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,920
Wa, the line is taking time.

104
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,880
Can you do me a favor?

105
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,840
What is it?

106
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Right this way please. This way.

107
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,080
Okay.

108
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,480
What is Johnny Kim's favorite food?

109
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,720
It's ramyeon!

110
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Wrong answer!

111
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,120
If there's any trouble,
turning back 10 minutes should be enough.

112
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,840
It's 2020.

113
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,080
2020 is wrong.

114
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
Jattawa.

115
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,600
What is Johnny Kim's favorite color?

116
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,640
It's purple!

117
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Wrong answer!

118
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,680
Next please.

119
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,400
Here you go.

120
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
Thank you so much.

121
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,240
Don't worry about it.

122
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,000
I didn't know you were his fan too.

123
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,560
I came here with my sister.

124
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,840
Johnny Kim is her favorite artist.

125
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,800
There's a lot of people here today.

126
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Yes.

127
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,920
Four…

128
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,119
How should I give her the evidence?

129
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
Is this mascot the same one I wore before?

130
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,680
Yes, it is.

131
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,359
Who's wearing it today?

132
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,079
I brought it just in case.
We won't need it.

133
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,720
Can I borrow it please?

134
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
One, two, three. You may start!

135
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
Oh, I wanted to give it to you.

136
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,960
Let's try again.
One, two, three, go!

137
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,840
Okay, one last time. One, two, three, go!

138
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,440
Next person please.

139
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,160
Can you hold this a second?

140
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
Nice try. Okay, one more time.
One, two, three, go!

141
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,120
I really want to give out the pillows.

142
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,160
Where should I put it?

143
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,840
One, two, three, go!

144
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,840
Oh, my!

145
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,600
Almost got it! One, two, three, go!

146
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Let's try again!

147
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,800
Here it goes!

148
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,280
One more time. One, two, three, go!

149
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Hey!

150
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,760
Hey! Get back here!

151
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,600
Leave the balls here.

152
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Four!

153
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,320
- Wa!
- Hey.

154
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,800
Watch out!

155
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,800
I can't use my ability now.

156
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,400
Four…

157
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Are you all right, Wa?

158
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,560
Four! Are you okay?

159
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm okay.

160
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,560
That kid didn't even say thank you to you.

161
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,200
Whatever. Let's go.

162
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Here.

163
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,840
Why didn't you stop the time?

164
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
What if it fell on you?

165
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,080
I couldn't use it then.

166
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,280
I might need to use it
for something important later.

167
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I won't go out anymore,
not until after my birthday.

168
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm so sorry
for getting you involved in this.

169
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,040
You don't have to be.

170
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,320
I'm actually glad that we came today.

171
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,080
Because you got to meet Four, right?

172
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,640
She looks pretty cool in person,
doesn't she?

173
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,520
It's because I was able
to give her the evidence.

174
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,160
Are you hungry? Let's go.

175
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,760
It's today.

176
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,920
Vivi has to make it past today.

177
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,120
You've been staring at the calendar
for almost ten minutes now.

178
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,560
I just want to make sure.

179
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,440
You've made this choice.

180
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,800
Nothing bad is going to happen to me.
Don't worry.

181
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,360
Vi! What are you doing?

182
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,800
Stop it! Let me cook today.

183
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,280
Hey! It's fine.

184
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
You can go rest.

185
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,240
But I've been doing this everyday.

186
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
It's fine.

187
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,840
I'll go rest then.

188
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,800
Okay.

189
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,480
Vi, watch your step too.

190
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,200
I'll be fine.

191
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
Wa! Wa!

192
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,480
Vi, are you okay?

193
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,160
How did you suddenly
fall off the stairs?

194
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
Are you hurt?

195
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm going to study in the Faculty of Arts.

196
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,680
Huh?

197
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,920
I saw that I graduated
from the Faculty of Arts in my vision.

198
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,960
Graduation?

199
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,840
Yes! I can see my future after today.

200
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Am I safe now?

201
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,280
Yes!

202
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,200
You're safe now.

203
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
We're okay now.

204
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,200
You're celebrating
your little sister's future.

205
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,480
Can you make it
a little more special?

206
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,800
Come on, we can do it next time.

207
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,560
Let's continue discussing
the ongoing case where

208
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,120
an arrest warrant was issued
for Mrs. Waran Narawattanavech,

209
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,240
accusing her of contracting her husband
Mr. Suriya's murderer.

210
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,080
That's Four's step-mother.

211
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
That means she looked at the evidence?

212
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,520
Mr. Ekkachai confessed that
Mrs. Waran hired him.

213
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,760
Earlier today,
police arrested Mr. Ekkachai or Mr. Sak

214
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,440
at the apartment
of Mr. Suriya's illegitimate daughter.

215
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,040
We believe
Mrs. Waran hired him to kill her.

216
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,360
This man…

217
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,200
Yes, do you recall?

218
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,680
He was the one who hurt you that night.

219
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,680
Vi!

220
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,920
Wa, I saw Four get shot.

221
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
Is it because I'm safe, so Four is…

222
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,440
Calm down.
Tell me more about what you saw.

223
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,520
I saw a woman wearing a gold watch.
She was the one who took the shot.

224
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,720
The time on the watch was 4:00 p.m.

225
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,840
4:00 p.m.?

226
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,160
I can't turn back the time again today.

227
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,000
Where is it, Vi?

228
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,560
I didn't see where.

229
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,640
I've to send something to my friend
for her report at campus.

230
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,360
Don't you have to be there?

231
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,960
I finished my part last night

232
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,960
because I want to spend time
with my girlfriend today.

233
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
At the campus.

234
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,320
I'll be back, Vi.

235
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,560
There will be a shooting on campus
at 4:00 p.m. Please hurry, officer.

236
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,160
What's this? You've only done two pages?

237
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,080
So we can change the mood too.

238
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,640
I'm hungry.

239
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,960
Where is Four?

240
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,200
And who are you?

241
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,560
Where is Four?

242
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,160
She's picking up her stuff
at the building.

243
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,840
There's a shooting!

244
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,800
Dispatch, there's an injured civilian.

245
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,200
Requesting ambulance
to the crime scene.

246
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Hey, miss! You can't go in there.

247
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
Officer, stop her!

248
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,320
Four!

249
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,360
Is anyone else hurt?

250
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Oh, you mean your friend there.

251
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
She's safe.

252
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Someone alerted us,
so we arrested her just in time.

253
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,320
Hello, Vi.

254
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,000
Wa, I just saw Four's future.

255
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,720
Her step-mother has been arrested.

256
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,320
She should be safe now.

257
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,120
I'm going home soon.

258
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,960
Why are you coming home?

259
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,600
Go talk to her.

260
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,400
If I can see both my future and hers,

261
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,280
it means that you're not
going to lose anyone anymore.

262
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,040
Do you remember me, Four?

263
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,600
It's me Wa. Jattawa.

264
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,360
If we turned back the time
to the first day that we met,

265
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,560
would you still remember me?

266
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,080
Of course I would.

267
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,520
Because there is only one Jattawa
in this world.

268
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,680
Do we know each other?

269
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
Four!

270
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
Are you all right?

271
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,440
- Four…
- Are you hurt?

272
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,960
Are you all right, Four?

273
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,520
Are you bleeding?

274
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,480
What happened?

275
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
The gunshot was really loud.

276
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,680
When a natural satellite
falls out of orbit,

277
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,000
there's almost a zero chance of it
reentering.

278
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
Who was that, Four?

279
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't know.

280
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,040
All I know is her name is Jattawa.

281
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,000
Jattawa? Like a plus sign?

282
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,360
Jattawa!

283
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,240
Do you remember me now?

284
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,480
All I know is that
I can't let you go anymore.

285
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,320
Don't ever leave me again.

286
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,440
In the end, we're not just
two different stars orbiting each other,

287
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,360
but we're both natural satellites
that orbit together.

288
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,840
Let's go.

289
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,120
Why did you bring me
to the volleyball court?

290
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,120
I have no interest
in joining the volleyball club.

291
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,280
I didn't bring you here to join.
I wanted to see Kie.

292
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,640
You know her, right?

293
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,360
Can you introduce me to her?

294
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,600
Wait a second.

295
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,360
How did you know that I know her?

296
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,840
I haven't told you anything about this.

297
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Yeah, whatever. Just help me out.

298
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,320
I'm having a football tryout later.

299
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
Don't worry, you got this.

300
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,120
Hey, you can't just know everything.

301
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,880
Are you a fortune teller?

302
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,720
Exactly. A very good one too.

303
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay then.

304
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,200
Tell me.

305
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,840
I'm joking. I'm not a fortune teller.

306
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,160
Hey, are you free tomorrow?

307
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,680
Do you want to grab something to eat? I…

308
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,720
Khun, I already have someone I like.

309
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,400
So?

310
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,120
Can you still go out
and eat with me and Top?

311
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,920
Of course I can. I just want to
address the elephant in the room.

312
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,520
It's nice to know
that you already have someone in mind,

313
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,840
so I can put a break on it.

314
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,600
There's Kie.

315
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Hello, Kie.

316
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,280
Hello.

317
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,840
This is Wa. She's my friend.

318
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,600
Khun's partner
for the representative contest.

319
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,160
Looking forward
to working with you soon.

320
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,400
Okay.

321
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,400
All right, I'll head
to the football tryouts now.

322
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,160
- I'll leave you two.
- Okay.

323
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,400
- Take care.
- Good luck. You got this.

324
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,600
If you are interested in joining the club,
you can.

325
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,120
We're open to all the freshmen.

326
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,440
Okay. But before I join the club,

327
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,440
I have something on my mind
I want to clear first.

328
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,960
What is it?

329
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
The video clip where Four slapped you.

330
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Oh, that clip.

331
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,320
There's nothing new. She's just like that.

332
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,120
Even though you guys were close before?

333
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,760
Hey, we just know each other.

334
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,080
But I've known about you for a while now.

335
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,400
What do you really want?

336
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,520
I'm not interested in blackmailing you.

337
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,280
What happened between you two
was a long ago.

338
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,080
You can't change anything.

339
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,239
But are you going to allow the past
to undermine your future?

340
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,560
It's not too late to do the right thing.

341
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,440
And I believe
that you already know what to do.

342
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,960
Kie, Four came to see you.

343
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
I'm joining the volleyball club.

344
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Are you here to join the club
or provoke Kie?

345
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,440
Ten, leave us. The rest of you too.

346
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,720
What if she hurts you again?

347
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,280
She won't hurt the person
who's about to apologize to her.

348
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,480
Four…

349
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm sorry.

350
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,560
Sorry for what? For the video clip?

351
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,560
For the lies that you've told?

352
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,320
Or for the fact that
you broke my leg deliberately.

353
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,640
I'm sorry for being jealous.

354
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,720
What I did to you,
I never meant to hurt you.

355
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,360
All I ever wanted was a chance,

356
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,520
because I grew up poor…

357
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,880
and my parents weren't supportive
like yours.

358
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,760
You know…

359
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,200
the reason I got my chance
wasn't because of my rich family…

360
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,120
or how supportive they were.

361
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,640
I fought for it, just like you did.

362
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,960
But what I didn't do is that

363
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,120
I never took advantage of the others
to make myself higher.

364
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,560
Will you forgive me?

365
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,600
I don't want us to be enemies anymore.

366
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,120
As long as you're aware of
what you've done

367
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,040
and how disgusting it was is enough.

368
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,440
We're not enemies, nor are we friends.

369
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,280
From now on, you mean nothing to me.

370
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,960
Let's go our separate ways.
