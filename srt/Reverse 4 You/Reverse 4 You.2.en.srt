1
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Mr. Somkiat has decided to buy this house

2
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,160
and he's paying all-cash
so I gave him a discount.

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,560
I'll try to get it done quickly.

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,800
In the meantime, you and Vivi…

5
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,880
What's this about, Uncle?
Who gave you the right to sell this house?

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,720
Technically I own this house.

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Your dad took a loan in my name for it,
don't you remember?

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,960
It was just a name.

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,480
My dad was the one who paid for it.

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,560
You said he wanted to change
its ownership directly to me,

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,039
not to him.

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,200
And that was his will.

13
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,560
Do you have any documents to show me?

14
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
You can sue me if you want.

15
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,920
I'll just tell the judge
I never said any of that.

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,200
You're unbelievably good,

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,200
covering your tracks for decades.

18
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,320
We just realized how deceiving you are.

19
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,080
Betraying even
your own brother's daughters.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,480
Look, I didn't want to do this,
but I really needed the money.

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,680
If the deal goes through,
I'll give you half a million each.

22
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,640
But aren't you selling it
at 4.5 million baht?

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,080
Earning back your profits
for looking after us all these years.

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,800
My son has
a six million baht gambling debt.

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,480
What am I supposed to do?

26
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,720
All these years, I've never thought about
taking advantage from raising you

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,480
even though
my wife kept complaining about it.

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,280
But I really need to do this.

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
And where are we supposed to go?

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,440
Like I said, I will give you the money.

31
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,360
You're both grownups now,
you can deal with it.

32
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,640
Wa, what are we supposed to do?

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,600
Where are we supposed to go?

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Wa, can I sleep with you?

35
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,920
Do you think Dad
will show up in Uncle's dreams

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and give him a nightmare
for what he's doing to us?

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,360
I'd prefer him
showing up in my dream instead,

38
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,240
so he can show us what to do next.

39
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,320
We'll be okay.

40
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,080
Yeah? you saw it in your vision?

41
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
No.

42
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,720
I just believe in you.

43
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,440
Whatever happens,

44
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
you will make things better.

45
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,280
Why are you up so early today?

46
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm thinking about
selling these sandwiches

47
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
and you're my first lab rat.

48
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,760
It's done.

49
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
Okay, let me try.

50
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,000
Wow, it's delicious!

51
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,480
Has my sister ever cooked anything bad?

52
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,800
Come on, you might be
the only one who likes my food.

53
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Let me know if you can sell them.

54
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,640
You don't believe
that I can make things better anymore?

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,960
Of course I believe in you.

56
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,320
But trust me,
what the future holds will be better.

57
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,160
I saw that you have a nice workplace
and a nice loving couple

58
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,840
because Four
is taking care of you very well.

59
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Four again. Can you leave her out of this?

60
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,920
I saw it in my vision.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
Four's going to give you something
that you really need.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,800
The person who made me
spend my money twice already?

63
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
I don't want to make you feel bad,

64
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,760
but that is never going to happen.

65
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm leaving. You should go back to sleep.

66
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,480
Hey, what about this room? It looks good.

67
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,080
Of course it's good.
It's 16,000 baht a month.

68
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,360
Top, look at me.
I can't even afford a 6,000 baht rent.

69
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
You're way too late.

70
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
How can you find
a cheaper apartment at this time?

71
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,400
What should I do?

72
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
I don't know.

73
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,960
Stop looking for a room.

74
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,240
What am I supposed to do then?
Cast a spell?

75
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,680
I found someone that can help you.

76
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,560
You just have to work for it.

77
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,800
Who is it?

78
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
I saw it in my vision that Four will
give you something you really need.

79
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Please tell me it's not…

80
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,640
Kie!

81
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
It's Kie.

82
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,600
Come on! I've already
made an appointment with her.

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
I'll be back!

84
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Let's go!

85
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,160
We'll be back, Top. Bye.

86
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,160
Bye.

87
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,480
Khun, was Kie the person
who got slapped by Four in the video clip?

88
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Yes, but you're not going
to greet her like that, right?

89
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,360
Of course not!
Who would do something like that?

90
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,360
But if you think about it,
she seems like a hothead too.

91
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
That's why she was in a fight with Four.

92
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,240
Sorry I'm late.

93
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
-Hi.
-Hello.

94
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
This will take just a moment.

95
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,240
This is Jattawa.

96
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Oh, you're Jattawa. You're looking for
an apartment for rent, right?

97
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,520
I can help you with that.

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you in charge of
the university's dormitory?

99
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,120
She's currently a member
in the student council

100
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,120
and she's running for student president
next term.

101
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,000
I met Khun during the student's hazing

102
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
so I invited him to join my team

103
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,360
as representative of the Faculty of Laws.

104
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Kie seems like a really nice person,
unlike Four.

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,800
If we have a chance to work together,
I'm sure it will be fun.

106
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,160
And that's why
I invited you to work with us.

107
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,760
Because if you're working in Kie's team,

108
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,560
you can use a special quota for renting
a good apartment outside the campus.

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,080
With a discount!

110
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll do it.

111
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,280
Well, I'll be hosting
a student council discussion next week.

112
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,160
You can help me with
coordinating with the location

113
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,480
and make sure
the event goes as planned. That's all.

114
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, is she an angel? Can't believe
Four wants to get in a fight with her.

115
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,200
Okay, if you have any questions prior
to the event, feel free to ask me.

116
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
Yes I have one question.

117
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,800
Why did Four slap you?

118
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,680
Jattawa!

119
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,680
I saw just a part of it in the video clip.
I didn't see what the whole thing was.

120
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
What really happened?
Why did she slap you?

121
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,680
Well, that was from the past.

122
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,600
Four doesn't really think about
other people's feelings.

123
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,960
Jattawa, how could you ask her that?

124
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,440
Why not? I can turn back the time.

125
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,520
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me anything.

126
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,680
Not at the moment.

127
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,120
Can you coordinate
with Faculty of Business Administration

128
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,240
to use their garden for the event?

129
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,440
I have to go.

130
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,360
-See you, guys!
-Thank you.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,280
Bye.

132
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,520
Garden from which faculty?

133
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,080
Business Administration,
where the Four Serpents like to go.

134
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
So that means I have to
go ask Four for permission?

135
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,200
Are you nuts?
Ask it from the faculty's staff.

136
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,200
After this, you can easily move
to the apartment outside of campus.

137
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,960
Lookmee, are you going
to help Fang with the report

138
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,240
or take a new profile picture?

139
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,640
What about you? Sitting like a model.

140
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,480
It's called being supportive.

141
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,360
Being supportive?
I can see you're on Instagram.

142
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,800
Are you stalking Johnny Kim? Let me see.

143
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,400
You can see it together with Four,
the event is on the 22nd.

144
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
On the 22nd?

145
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,160
Hey, Khun.

146
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,120
How's it, Wa? Did you get the permission?

147
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,240
It seems like the Four Serpents
are using it on the same day.

148
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
What?

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
I'll take care of it first.

150
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
Hello?

151
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
Hello, Kie.

152
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,720
Excuse me.

153
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,080
I'd like to ask a permission
to use this location for hosting an event.

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,480
Location department is on the 2nd floor.

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm asking you guys.

156
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,440
I believe it's your territory?

157
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,720
How did you puzzle that out?

158
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,760
Do you think you can
just simply ask and use it?

159
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
Just tell her already
that we don't have the authorization.

160
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
Just go ask the faculty.

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,840
Oh, Lookmee, we're teasing the kid.

162
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,560
You're a freshman, right?

163
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,280
Don't believe the rumor you hear about us.
It's nonsense.

164
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
We just like to come hang out here often.

165
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,400
If we were going to use the location,
we'd have to get permission too.

166
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,840
So, if I ask the faculty
to use this location on the 22nd,

167
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,320
I'll get it, right?

168
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,440
Absolutely not!

169
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
Why not?

170
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,760
We've already asked for permission
to use this location on that day.

171
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,000
But I just asked the department.

172
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,440
The department must be confused.

173
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,560
Well, we can move our shooting date.

174
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,960
But we have to check
with the person who filed the form,

175
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,440
if she's okay with it.

176
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,160
Who filed it?

177
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,920
There she is. Why don't you ask her?

178
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,960
You again?

179
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,400
What happened in the past
was just a coincidence.

180
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,960
I was just delivering pizza.

181
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,120
What about the running race?

182
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,080
Well, I'm worried about those
who aren't athletes and want to compete.

183
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,760
Seriously?

184
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,800
Yes.

185
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,240
That was a horrible save.

186
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,720
What about when you
were staring at me in this garden?

187
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,920
Here we go.

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
I think you're obsessed with me,

189
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,920
I can't even recall
seeing you in any garden.

190
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,360
Don't tell me the reason
you remembered all these is because…

191
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,640
you've been thinking of me?

192
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Yes, I think about what your plans are!

193
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,760
What plans?

194
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,920
I think it's you who's trying
to pick on me.

195
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,240
I've told you that I'll fill out
the new location applications for you.

196
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,280
All you have to do is sign them
and I'll be gone.

197
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
But I think you want to talk to me

198
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,280
so you keep dragging.

199
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,480
Go fill out the forms.

200
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,880
Really? Thank you!

201
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,720
Is there a problem?

202
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Whose event is this?

203
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,440
It's my event.
Do you have a problem with that?

204
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,560
No problem at all.

205
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
I just talked to Four
and she's okay with it.

206
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,400
I said "fill out the forms,"
doesn't mean I'll sign them.

207
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,720
But I thought…

208
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,440
I'll never postpone anything
for a person like her.

209
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,280
Go find another place.

210
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm sorry for making you
talk to a person like that.

211
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,920
So what are we going to do
about the location?

212
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,600
We'll probably have to
use the area at my faculty.

213
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Okay.

214
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,960
About the apartment, I don't think
I can help you with that anymore.

215
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,080
It's fine, I get it.

216
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,560
How long have you known Four?

217
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
I don't really know her.

218
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,400
We've met a couple of times.

219
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,160
Well, next time, if she bothers you again,
just tell her you're my sister.

220
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,000
It's not like that.

221
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,680
She's never really bothered me.

222
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm the one who's bothering her.

223
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,160
Anyway, thank you again for everything.

224
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,240
Also, I don't really want
to take sides with anyone.

225
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,360
You'll know whose side to take.

226
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,600
I have to go, see you later.

227
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,120
I've been looking for an apartment.

228
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,839
Only the expensive ones are left.
The cheap ones are far away.

229
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
You'll find it.

230
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,400
I saw that we'll be moving
into a new room soon. Don't worry!

231
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,599
I've told you
that not everything you see is true.

232
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,920
Like today,
Four didn't give me what I needed.

233
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,920
Really?

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But I saw that
we'll be moving into a new room soon.

235
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,800
Plus, it's really beautiful!

236
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,880
Rooms aren't easy to find.

237
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,080
I've been searching all day and haven't…

238
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
What's wrong, Wa?
You were saying something?

239
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Vivi, we've got a room!

240
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
"There's a room available."

241
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,040
Are you serious?

242
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,360
You're serious!

243
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,000
I told you we'd get a new room.

244
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
It's close to your school
and my university as well.

245
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
We've got a place!

246
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
Yes!

247
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,680
Let's pack up.

248
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,080
Okay, I'm on it.

249
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,400
Wow.

250
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,640
You guys are so lucky.

251
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,320
The owner wanted a tenant quick,
so you got this amazing deal.

252
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,000
They also left you
with these nice furniture!

253
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
How's that? Do you like it?

254
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,840
Thank you so much again
for letting us know about the room.

255
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,880
We were really in need of it.

256
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,240
You're very welcome.

257
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,520
If you need anything, call me. Okay?

258
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
-Okay.
-Okay!

259
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Thank you so much.

260
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,520
No worries.

261
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,360
Nice, isn't it?

262
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,200
It's very beautiful, Wa!

263
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, dibs on this room!

264
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,560
This room?

265
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
This will be my room then.

266
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,760
Are you sure this is 3,000 baht a month?

267
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,560
Isn't it too good to be true?

268
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,040
Is there a ghost in this room?

269
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,360
A room this big with rent this cheap,

270
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,240
if there's really a ghost,
I'm fine with it!

271
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,200
Me too!

272
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,720
Isn't it beautiful?

273
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
I told you we'd get a new room.

274
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,800
All that's left is to wait for
your soulmate to give you what you want.

275
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,560
Sorry, but I don't have any obligations
to get anything from Four,

276
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,240
and there is no reason
for us to meet again.

277
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,480
Because she's not my soulmate.

278
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,240
She's living next door?

279
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,640
Isn't she working
at that rich person's house?

280
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,120
She comes here for a shower
before class every morning.

281
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,560
Wait, isn't she in the same class
as Khun today?

282
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,320
Yes, she is.
She likes to sit next to Khun.

283
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,320
Well then,
she might be skipping class today.

284
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,560
Hey, my bag!

285
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,400
Who took my bag? Give it back!

286
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Who is it?

287
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Oh, shit! It's Four.

288
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,000
My stuff is in there. Please give it back!

289
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,400
I'm begging you.

290
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,640
Who is it? Please give it back.

291
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
Give it back to her.

292
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
My stuffs are in that bag!

293
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,920
No way.

294
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Which part of that didn't you understand?

295
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
Give it back!

296
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,720
Hey, who is it?

297
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,320
-One…
-Please give it back!

298
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,240
…two…

299
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,240
three!

300
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
Hey, I forgot that I can turn back time.

301
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,240
But wait, let me see who did it first.

302
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,520
Wa, why didn't you turn back time?

303
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,200
I was in shock.

304
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,520
Who would've guessed
that Four would come to the rescue?

305
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,160
I told you that it was something
that you really needed

306
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,880
and Four had to deliver it.

307
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,480
Didn't you see
that I will be harassed in your vision?

308
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,240
Destiny might have wanted me to see

309
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,400
just the part where your soulmate
came to the rescue.

310
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,240
She isn't so bad after all, right?

311
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,960
That might be true,

312
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,640
but it doesn't mean
that she's my soulmate after all.

313
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,920
It could have been…

314
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,480
just a fluke.

315
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,760
I'll trust your vision
when everything you see is true.

316
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,720
But it's impossible,
because you were wrong once, remember?

317
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,920
LOTTERY RESULT
LAST 2 DIGITS - 44

318
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,440
Wa. Did you buy the lottery with "44"
when the school opened last year?

319
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,760
I think it was around that time.

320
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,080
That's why I said you were mistaken!

321
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,880
Wait a second.

322
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,040
This month last year.

323
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,560
Why? Did Facebook give you throwback?

324
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
The "44" digit came out this month!

325
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
Check this out.

326
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,520
See?

327
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,360
It was true.

328
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,360
Yes!

329
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,720
Yes what?

330
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,680
Your vision's a year late.
How's that any good?

331
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,600
Well, it means that my vision was correct.

332
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,480
It was just a different year.

333
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,160
Which also means
that all the visions I've seen were true.

334
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,640
Do you believe me now
that Four is truly your soulmate?

335
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,200
So Four is really my soulmate?

336
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
You're still up, Wa?

337
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm not so sleepy.

338
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,720
Well, why don't you go up to the rooftop?

339
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
Rooftop?

340
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
Yes.

341
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,920
Four! What are you doing?
Don't do anything stupid!

342
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,280
Why is it so easy this time?

343
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,840
Because I didn't do anything stupid
like you said.

344
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,000
So what are you doing up here?

345
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,440
I don't have the rights to come up here?

346
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,920
What do you say, law student?

347
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,680
I'm asking you nicely.

348
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
I couldn't sleep.

349
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,920
So I came up here for some quiet.

350
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
But I didn't know that I was followed.

351
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Followed? Not me, I didn't.

352
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
I can't sleep either.

353
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,440
How should I know?
I see you everywhere I go.

354
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
Even your room is next to mine.

355
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,280
At least this time,
you're wearing something.

356
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,960
Well, thank you, Four.

357
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,840
Let's call it even
for calling you "Kie's girl".

358
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,440
Next time if she bothers you,
tell her you're my sister.

359
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,080
It's not like that.
She's never bothered me.

360
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm the one who's bothering her.

361
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,480
Also, I don't really want
to take sides with anyone.

362
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,960
So we're good?

363
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
No! I also helped you
at the running track.

364
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,760
Remember?

365
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,200
I didn't tell anyone
it was you who pulled the fire alarm.

366
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
I also helped you.

367
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,320
You helped me?

368
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,360
It was chaotic because of you.

369
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,240
But what if I didn't do that
and you went on the race, what then?

370
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,680
I wouldn't have run.

371
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,520
How am I supposed to race
when someone cries at me like that?

372
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
Also, no one has ever…

373
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
really cared about me like that.

374
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,200
Here.

375
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,600
Throw it away for me.

376
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,880
Wait a second, Four.

377
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,240
Matter of fact,
you still owe me one thing.

378
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
What is it?

379
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,800
For bumping into me,

380
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,080
you'll have to pay for that.

381
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,720
Is this a dream? We live in the same place
with people driving these fancy cars.

382
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,120
The owner of this car
could be the owner of this apartment.

383
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
Now, I wonder whose car this is.

384
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,720
Here, Vivi.

385
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,320
Four!

386
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Four again, I've told you that Four is…

387
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
Wa, look!

388
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,800
Does a housekeeper
drive something that fancy?

389
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,560
She might have borrowed it
from someone. Let's go.

390
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,160
A nice car like that must have a cool AC.

391
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,320
I'll go to school by myself today.

392
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
Wait, what?

393
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Bye.

394
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,120
By yourself?

395
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,560
Vivi! Are you serious?

396
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,720
Yes.

397
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,800
What's up with her?

398
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,320
What's up with this again?

399
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,400
Get in the car.

400
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,800
Is this really your car?

401
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,280
"Seemaysa Narawattanavech"

402
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,400
Good thing I didn't ask
if she's a housekeeper from that house.

403
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,360
Why did you act like you weren't the owner
of that house when I delivered the pizza?

404
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,160
It wasn't really mine.

405
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,960
It used to be my dad's,
but now it belongs to his wife.

406
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,840
His wife? I guess it's not her mom.

407
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,840
The relationship in her house
must be complicated.

408
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Well, thank you anyway.

409
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,720
I just want you to pay me back
for bumping into me the other day.

410
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,240
I have some questions for the law student.

411
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,920
About what?

412
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,600
If I wanted to prevent someone
with a severe dementia condition

413
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,040
from being able to make any settlements,
how should I do that?

414
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,680
That's easy.

415
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,160
The internet and google have been
available for a while, you know.

416
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,680
If you have a severe dementia condition,

417
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,560
you can petition the court

418
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,200
so that person will be recognized
as incapacitated or disabled.

419
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,240
Then you can appoint
one of your relatives as your curator.

420
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,880
A curator is like a representative.

421
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,040
They can perform juristic acts
or settlements for that person.

422
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,320
And to cancel any of those acts,

423
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
a curator can be represented as well.

424
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,520
How do you file an application
at the court?

425
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,640
You'll need a medical certificate

426
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,520
to confirm that person
has a dementia condition,

427
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,320
then you'll need to contact an attorney.

428
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,800
What about a success rate?

429
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,600
It depends on
the condition of that person,

430
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,040
if they really have dementia condition.

431
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,680
So, are we good?

432
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,720
Not yet.

433
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,800
Because after this,
you will be my legal counsellor.

434
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,760
This is how you'll pay me back.

435
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,040
But…

436
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,800
Hey!

437
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,960
My name is Wa, "Jattawa".

438
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,880
You dropped something.

439
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,720
512 baht.

440
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,960
That will be 512 baht.

441
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,120
Can't you give it to me nicely?

442
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,960
College life is so boring when having
an evening make-up class like this.

443
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,480
-Wa.
-Yes?

444
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,560
Do you have to work today?

445
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm working less these days.

446
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,239
I've been studying
so my scholarship don't get revoked.

447
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,639
Well then, should we go
get dinner together?

448
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,679
We don't usually get free time like this.

449
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Nah, it'll be hard for me
to find a ride back after.

450
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,800
Didn't you ride your bike today?

451
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,199
My bike broken down today.

452
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,320
But luckily this morning,
Four drove me here. Or else…

453
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,080
Wait a second, Four?

454
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,440
How did you end up coming with her?

455
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,760
We live in the same building.
Her room is next to mine.

456
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Wait. You're Four's neighbor?
Four from the Four Serpents?

457
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,760
Hey, guys, they aren't like
what most people think.

458
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,480
But what about the video clip?

459
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,560
Honestly, I don't really know
what happened.

460
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,440
But as of now, I don't think
she's ferocious like that anymore.

461
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,880
Well, I have to go. See you!

462
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,800
See you.

463
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,960
Good luck.

464
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,880
Bye.

465
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,840
Is Four going to be back
at the apartment by now?

466
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,960
Let me go!

467
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,360
-You come here!
-Four!

468
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,320
Ten!

469
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,960
Let me go!

470
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,920
Four!

471
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,840
Let me go.

472
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,360
You little brat!
You asked for it first! Why?

473
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,720
Kie is the president of my club.

474
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,160
You're a freshman.
You don't know shit. Shut the hell up!

475
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,800
Everyone knows that you played poorly
and broke your leg,

476
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,840
costing the team the semi-finals.

477
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,640
And you're blaming it on Kie.

478
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,080
You always try to
get into trouble with her. What a loser.

479
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,280
Say that again.

480
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,840
What a loser.
You deserved it, that your leg--

481
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,920
Four…
