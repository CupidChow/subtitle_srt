=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 52=

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,450
As long as I am alive,

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,890
I will definitely

4
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,130
be the first person to stop you.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,620
Stop?

6
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,890
If you weren't my son,

7
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,520
you would have been dead long ago.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,330
Do you think Chen Zou really
didn't dare to kill you?

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,700
That's because of my orders.

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,020
I told him

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,270
to take you away from Jiangzhou.

12
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,040
I didn't want you

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,110
to suffer any harm.

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,220
So, in order to

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,740
make me leave Jiangzhou,

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,970
you sent Ding Mao

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,500
to kill the three tigers of Jiangzhou
and frame it on me.

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,110
You got it wrong.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,330
Killing the three tigers of Jiangzhou

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,220
was always part of my plan.

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,740
Your showing up

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,530
just happened to fit into my scheme.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,810
The three tigers of Jiangzhou
have been entrenched here for years.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,660
Even Lei Hai didn't dare to touch them.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,940
To completely control Jiangzhou,

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,860
we must eliminate this threat.

27
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,110
- Understand?
- Got it.

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,660
I've already thought of a method.

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,740
Just follow what I say.

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,940
Not only can you get rid of
these three old men,

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,220
but you can also retreat unscathed.

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,510
What method?

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,330
You still have the third question.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,310
After you eliminated Master Long

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,220
of Youlong Gambling House,

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Juta and Youlan fell out.

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,020
This way, the Youlong Gambling House
will inevitably change hands.

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,720
The Jushangfang Branch

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,760
can then take its place.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,810
And you can

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,990
secretly

42
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,180
plant the dynamite.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,460
Do you remember when you were a child,

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,940
I taught you how to play chess?

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,850
Life is like a game of chess.

46
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,780
It requires great courage

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,290
and meticulous thinking.

48
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,780
Both are indispensable.

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,530
Qingyao is my most brilliant move.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,900
You really are a good strategist.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
Alright.

52
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,250
I'm not that heinous.

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,410
At least, the three tigers of Jiangzhou
who oppressed the people

54
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,830
were killed by me.

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,550
This is not too much, right?

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,990
The three tigers of Jiangzhou
are indeed notorious for their misdeeds.

57
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,260
But they have not become so depraved

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,270
as to blow up the river dike

59
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,320
and disregard the lives
of Jiangzhou's citizens.

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Enough.

61
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,340
No matter what you say,

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,010
you have my blood in your body.

63
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,710
In a certain sense,

64
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,690
we are the same kind of people.

65
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,250
I am not like you.

66
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,970
Why are you doing this?

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,180
The Doctor said

68
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,060
I am the chosen savior

69
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,780
and the ruler of this land.

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,660
I set the rules of the game.

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,730
I am the eternal god of Jiangzhou!

72
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,390
Huole!

73
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,550
Youlan,

74
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,810
after capturing Ma Xiaonian,

75
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,100
I need you to do one more thing for me.

76
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,990
Dad.

77
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,990
Night God.

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,290
You are under arrest.

79
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,580
The Lei's Army won!

80
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,120
Chen Biao has retreated!

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,780
The Lei's Army won!

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,490
Uncle Fu.

83
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Uncle Fu.

84
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,430
Dad.

85
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,460
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,610
(After going through all these,)

87
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,970
(I suddenly realized)

88
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,850
(that freeing the world from injustice)

89
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,490
(is destined to be a painful process.)

90
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,900
(But I will not be afraid.)

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,170
(Because everything I do)

92
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,140
(is to reduce the world's suffering)

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,460
(and fill it with light.)

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,160
(For some matters, there is no way)

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,410
(to come back.)

96
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,900
(If I had one more time,)

97
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,660
(would I still make the same choice?)

98
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,410
(My answer is)

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
(justice)

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,780
(will never be absent.)

101
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,470
Order from the Commander,

102
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,320
from now on,

103
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,560
the Lei's Army will withdraw
from the Jiangzhou Police Station.

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,880
The director position

105
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,970
will be reinstated to Xu Wuwen.

106
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,170
Additionally, city taxes
will be reduced or exempted,

107
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,410
and those in special hardship

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,560
can go to the temporary office

109
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,830
to register for labor recruitment

110
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,290
and apply for special subsidies
approved by the Commander.

111
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,680
- Nice.
- Nice.

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,910
Qin Weilian, who once studied abroad,
is a lawyer from Jiangzhou.

113
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,000
For his own personal gain,

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,590
he summoned Zou Jing, Chen Zou,

115
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,560
Huo Qingxin, Ding Mao, Qingyao,

116
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,640
and others

117
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,710
to form the Night God Society

118
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,470
and recruited many prisoners

119
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,170
from Jiangzhou Prison as their henchmen.

120
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,140
They tried to endanger the lives
of all citizens

121
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,820
to satisfy their own selfish desires.

122
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,930
Fortunately, the detective squad
had noticed it

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and joined forces
with various righteous individuals

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to turn the tide

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,350
and thwart Qin's conspiracy.

126
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,930
They have captured all the members

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,140
of the Night God Society.

128
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,520
Qin Weilian disregarded the law

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,440
and deliberately broke it.

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,170
His crimes are severe and unforgivable.

131
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,830
His henchmen

132
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,760
aided and abetted him.

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,170
They disregarded the value
of human lives.

134
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,410
Their crimes are equally severe.

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,850
Qin and his followers

136
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,590
have now been handed over
to the Jiangzhou Court

137
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,530
for trial.

138
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,850
Soon they will be sentenced

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,140
according to Jiangzhou's law.

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,610
The net of justice is vast

141
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,850
and no one can escape it.

142
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,260
All our citizens

143
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,830
should remember this.

144
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,740
Well done!

145
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,620
Well done!

146
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,890
Well done!

147
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,580
(Walking for the Innocent)

148
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,590
Xiaofan.

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,580
Why is this hanging here?

150
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,630
It hasn't even been a year.

151
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,670
The competition isn't over.

152
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,730
This plaque is mine.

153
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,220
I earned it with my own strength.

154
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,260
Director Xu said

155
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,550
that the two of you worked together

156
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,830
to solve the Night God case,

157
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,180
so you both deserve these four words.

158
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
From now on,

159
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,590
the two of you are the men
who walk for the innocent

160
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,650
in Jiangzhou Police Station.

161
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,000
Since Captain Song and Detective Qin

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,960
both don't want it.

163
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,340
I'll just put it back in my office.

164
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,430
- No way.
- No way.

165
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,940
Childish. Let's go.

166
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,250
Go? Where?

167
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,300
Drink coffee.

168
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,130
It's been a long time.

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,970
I still can't get used to this stuff.

170
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,710
When I was a kid,

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,770
I secretly drank my dad's coffee.

172
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,300
At that time, I didn't understand

173
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,490
why he drank such bitter stuff.

174
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,880
Later,

175
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,730
I found out I relied on it
even more than he did.

176
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,950
Huole.

177
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
We know

178
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,120
that you can't

179
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,700
accept this completely right now.

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,940
We understand

181
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,130
that comfort

182
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,770
is of no use for you at all.

183
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,490
But we still want you to know

184
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,420
that whenever

185
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,460
you need us,

186
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,850
we will be by your side.

187
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,730
My dad meticulously planned all of this.

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,180
As his closest kin,

189
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,730
I have never noticed anything.

190
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,180
I've been thinking

191
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,180
why exactly this happened.

192
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,580
But the only answer I can think of

193
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,340
is what he said.

194
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,890
We are essentially the same kind
of person.

195
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,420
He understands me
as well as he understands himself.

196
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,240
Then,

197
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,280
I can instinctively dispel

198
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,970
any doubts I have in my mind.

199
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,960
What exactly are you trying to say?

200
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,730
I have a strange feeling.

201
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,300
I'm afraid that one day,

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,220
I will become just like him.

203
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,220
No, we believe in you.

204
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,180
If that day really comes,

205
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,200
I hope that no matter what,

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,060
you will stop me.

207
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,420
Have I ever told you

208
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,340
that my father

209
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,730
was a robber?

210
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,580
The same blood flows in me.

211
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,580
But I become a police officer.

212
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,650
Even if you and Qin Weilian are similar,

213
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,010
there is one thing
that makes you different.

214
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
In your heart,

215
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,850
a towering tree grows there.

216
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,650
It will never wither.

217
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,850
Because it is nourished by justice.

218
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,640
That's right.

219
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,300
You also have us.

220
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,970
As long as we are here,

221
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,470
your tree

222
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,970
will never fall.

223
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,340
You are right.

224
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,970
No matter whose son I am,

225
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,820
first and foremost,

226
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,700
I am myself.

227
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,250
Crime is their whole life.

228
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,650
But

229
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,770
we have our own lives.

230
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,180
My life

231
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,820
is to catch these criminals

232
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,820
and free this world from injustice.

233
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,610
I was born here.

234
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,340
I love this place.

235
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,540
I want to protect it.

236
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,970
That's

237
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,770
why I want to be a police officer.

238
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,100
Qin Huole is my friend.

239
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,940
Even if it costs me my life,

240
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,060
I will save him.

241
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
You should leave quickly.

242
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,950
What about you?

243
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,940
I'll do some exercise.

He avoided him every time they met.

289
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
Thank you for that.
