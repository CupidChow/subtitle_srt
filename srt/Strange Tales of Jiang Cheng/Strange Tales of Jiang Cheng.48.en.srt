2
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,360
Master You.

3
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,360
Master You.

4
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,610
I won't die.

5
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm really not young anymore.

6
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,800
Master You.

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,530
Thanks to you today.

8
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,380
Don't flatter yourself.

9
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,970
I'm not helping you for free.

10
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,150
I know.

11
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,780
Cheng Tianlang has already told me.

12
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,870
Rest assured.

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,410
Once the current issue is resolved,

14
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,140
I will immediately start investigating
your case.

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,440
By then,

16
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,020
no matter what, I will give you a result.

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
You know what?

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,140
Ever since I saw you,

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
I suddenly understood

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,810
that

21
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,530
even if

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,780
I am willing to stay here,

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,970
the fact that I'm not a murderer

24
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,100
is important.

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,970
After I help clear your name,

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,890
I'll find a way to move Sanbao,

27
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,250
and find another way

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,730
to help you stay here.

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,180
Is that what you mean?

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,380
I've, I've...

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
I, I...

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,150
I've never met

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,010
someone who understands me
like you do.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
Are you okay?

35
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,320
I've roughly figured out

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,440
what Huo Qingxin and Chen Zou

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,220
are planning to do.

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,130
They want to blow up the river dike

39
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,250
and let the river water flood in.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,760
When Jiangzhou is in chaos,

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,970
they will seize the chance

42
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,220
to overthrow Lei Hai and take control
of Jiangzhou.

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,900
They, they...

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,900
Are they Chen Biao's men?

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,730
I'm not sure about that yet.

46
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,940
But for the sake of the citizens,

47
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,900
I must stop them.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,760
It's the right thing to do.

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,060
So I have to leave now.

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
Master You.

51
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,230
After I leave,

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,530
you must take care of yourself.

53
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,780
Don't worry.

54
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,390
This place

55
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,180
is my home.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
Lanterns?

57
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,900
Why are the lanterns lit?

58
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,520
Liang, run faster.

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
He's too badly injured.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,430
I'm afraid it will be too late.

61
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,290
Got it, Tianlang.

62
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,950
Tianlang.

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,460
Didn't you quit the old business?

64
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,940
Where did you pick up this bloody man?

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,110
- Stop talking and run quickly.
- Got it.

66
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,890
Luckily, I'm quick-witted

67
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,480
to go find him at the newly opened
Jushangfang.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,340
Otherwise, he's doomed.

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,760
Hurry up.

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
You're awake.

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,180
Why did Zou Jing shoot you?

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,460
He must be one of Night God's men.

73
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,570
Quickly go to He Lingyu's house.

74
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,660
Liang, don't go to the hospital.
Go to the He Residence.

75
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,830
Got it.

76
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,510
Who's there?

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Uncle Fu.

78
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,310
Young Master.

79
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,550
Young Master.

80
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,430
Young Master.

81
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,230
Young Master.

82
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,370
You're awake.

83
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,580
How did you find me?

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,900
Your father sent me to pick you up.

85
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,990
No.

86
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,050
I have something urgent to do.

87
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,550
Tell my dad

88
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,430
not to worry.

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,020
Young Master, you are too weak now.

90
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,140
You need to rest well.

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,160
It's okay.

92
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,140
Young Master.

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,080
The prison guards just came by.

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,920
They said

95
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,360
you are now an escaped convict.

96
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,660
They will issue a wanted notice.

97
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,410
Don't worry. I have a plan.

98
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,730
Young Master.

99
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,610
No matter what you are going to do,

100
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,950
you should at least consider Master,

101
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,590
who is always thinking about you.

102
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,680
You should go see him

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,410
to put his mind at ease, right?

104
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,480
You're right.

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Uncle Fu,

106
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,870
I'll get dressed

107
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,340
and go see him in a bit.

108
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,750
Master.

109
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,310
- Master.
- Dad.

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,170
I brought Young Master back.

111
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,230
You may leave.

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Here.

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,800
Fresh coffee.

114
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,370
Chat with me for a while.

115
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,990
Dad,

116
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,370
if you have something to say,
just say it.

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm listening.

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,440
Why are you in such a hurry?

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,850
Something huge has happened.

120
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,580
If I go late, it will be doomed.

121
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,020
Do you really think you're part
of the detective squad?

122
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,200
Without you, will Jiangzhou City
be destroyed?

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,890
I'm not lying to you.

124
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,220
Someone wants to blow up the river dike

125
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,220
and flood Jiangzhou City.

126
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,470
If I don't go to stop it,

127
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,990
the people of this city will be doomed.

128
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,100
- Is it that dangerous?
- Yes.

129
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,290
Then you shouldn't go out.

130
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,930
I'm doing this to save your life.

131
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,370
I can't let you

132
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,400
run wild outside.

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,340
Handbook of Black Magic.

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,290
Dr. Sells' masterpiece.

135
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,050
If I remember correctly,

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,850
this is Dr. Sells' posthumous work,
right?

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Back in Europe,

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,340
there was a criminal genius named
Dr. Sells

139
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,970
who was extremely skilled
in hypnotic control.

140
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,370
In this method,

141
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,580
he committed countless crimes in Europe.

142
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,920
According to the police,

143
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,960
he had no less than 20 disciples.

144
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,530
Over 20 disciples?

145
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,850
Maybe the culprit
of this case

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,170
is also one of his disciples.

147
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,630
Son,

148
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,290
it seems you've already guessed it out.

149
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,140
Since you can't speak,

150
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,260
let me

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,170
ask you a question.

152
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,780
If it is me who's going to blow up

153
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,340
the river dike,

154
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,220
what would you do?

155
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,700
I should have guessed it out earlier.

156
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,780
In the entire Jiangzhou,

157
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,100
only you had the opportunity
to contact Dr. Sells.

158
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,410
When you studied abroad in Europe,

159
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,640
it was exactly the time when Dr. Sells

160
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,700
was committing crimes madly.

161
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,050
You were the one
who taught Ding Mao hypnotism.

162
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,220
With the cooperation of Chen Zou,

163
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,340
you met Ding Mao in prison.

164
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,110
Sir,

165
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,490
Qin Weilian is here.

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
Come in.

167
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,580
Since when did you start suspecting me?

168
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,580
That sketch.

169
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,000
I can tell the taste

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,930
of our family's coffee.

171
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,290
Moreover, that sketch

172
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,140
was initially not drawn with a brush,

173
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,260
but with a pen.

174
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,140
More specifically,

175
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,490
this one.

176
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,930
My mother gave you this pen.

177
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,150
Even though it has long been split,

178
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,780
you never let me touch it
since I was a child.

179
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,750
You dipped a brush in ink

180
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,100
to cover the pen's writing.

181
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,700
Even if the ink is thick,

182
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,320
it is difficult to cover

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,300
the pen's hard lines.

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,180
It's like

185
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,890
paint can't cover isinglass.

186
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,120
So

187
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,130
nothing can really be hidden from you.

188
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,060
You deliberately showed a flaw

189
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,750
by inserting Dr. Sells' posthumous work

190
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,940
upside down

191
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,010
to test me, right?

192
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,700
You know more than I think.

193
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Dad,

194
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,940
are you the Night God?

195
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,730
Now you know where you get

196
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,180
your talent from, right?

197
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,820
Why?

198
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,970
Why is it you?

199
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,890
Master, something's wrong!

200
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,940
Captain Song, what's going on?

201
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,970
You... you are He Lingyu?

202
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,000
I am.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,350
Captain Song specifically asked for you.

204
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,370
He's injured now.
Quickly find a doctor for him.

205
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,540
Dr. Fan, why are you here?

206
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,650
What's going on?

207
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,940
Captain Song was shot.

208
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,940
Quick, save him.

209
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,970
I need to stop his bleeding immediately.

210
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,820
Quick, carry him to the basement.

211
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,560
What are you standing there for? Hurry!

212
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,300
- Mrs. Qin, quick, hot water!
- Be careful.

213
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,460
Master, take a look.

214
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,420
It's almost time.

215
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,640
I should go.

216
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,420
Once you take this step,

217
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,770
there's no turning back.

218
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,490
Your strategies are flawless.

219
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,610
You'll definitely succeed.

220
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,590
Qin Huole,

221
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,650
I've finally caught you.

222
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,100
Today, I'm going to kill you

223
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,920
to avenge my father.

224
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,760
Uncle Fu.

225
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,710
Uncle Fu.

226
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,880
Uncle Fu.

227
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,000
Mr. He,

228
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,770
the bullet has been removed.

229
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,340
Song He is fine now.

230
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,940
Leave the rest to us.

231
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,400
At this time,

232
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,130
if anything happens outside,

233
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,850
please take care of it.

234
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,950
Alright.

235
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,180
I'll go right away.

236
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,580
He's awake.

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
Xiaofan?

238
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,310
It's me.

239
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,770
I'm back.

240
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Miss.

241
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
Miss.

242
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,730
Miss!

243
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,730
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

244
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,240
(Qingmang, captain of Lei Hai's guards)
How am I supposed to explain this?

245
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,680
Explain what? If you don't tell him,

246
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,580
how would he know?

247
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,490
Come on, I'll take you to a safe place.

248
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,750
My father definitely won't find us.

249
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,340
Where are we going, Miss?

250
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,180
You really know how to pick a place.

251
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,470
I knew

252
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,180
that Mr. He won't tell my father.

253
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,040
Be careful.

254
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,920
Xiaofan.

255
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,370
Thank you for saving me.

256
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,820
How is Huole doing?

257
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,940
Oh no, I forgot about that.

258
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,000
He called earlier.

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,040
He said Chen Zou and his team
are planning to blow up the dike.

260
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,710
We must rush to the Jushangfang Branch

261
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,550
to stop them.

262
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,470
What?

263
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,300
How could you forget something
so important?

264
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,580
I... I was just worried he might die.

265
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,130
When Qin Huole asks me for him later,

266
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,300
how will I explain?

267
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,700
By the way, that guy Chen Zheng

268
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,340
is also one of them.

269
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,600
Don't worry.

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,700
I'll inform the Captain right away.

271
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,040
I guarantee not a word will be missed.

272
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,700
Officer Chen, hurry.

273
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,890
Freshly baked buns.

274
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
Eat them while they're hot.

275
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,670
I wasn't hungry at first,

276
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,920
but as soon as I saw the food you bought,

277
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,340
my stomach started growling.

278
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,540
Has Huole called?

279
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,760
Not yet.

280
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,890
Let's wait a bit longer.

281
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I believe he will find
the right opportunity

282
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,580
to contact us as soon as possible.

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,010
The more critical the time is,

284
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,040
the more patience we need.

285
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,120
Don't you think?

286
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,670
Yes.

287
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,920
Don't move.

288
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,160
Cheng Tianlang, what are you doing?

289
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,110
Put the knife down right now,

290
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,400
- or I won't be polite.
- Stop talking nonsense. Tell me.

291
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,680
Was it Huole who called just now?

292
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,520
What did he say?

293
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,420
Or I'll stab you to death.

294
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,490
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

295
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,990
Don't play tricks with me.

296
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,490
I've done things
that could get me beheaded.

297
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,180
Do you really think I wouldn't dare
to kill you?

298
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,350
Speak up!

299
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,630
Chen Zou and his team are planning
to blow up the river dike.

300
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,520
What?

301
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,420
What about Mao?

302
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,340
Mao

303
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,890
might not be coming back.

304
