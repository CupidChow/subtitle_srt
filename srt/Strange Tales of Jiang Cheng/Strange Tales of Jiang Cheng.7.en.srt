2
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,060
(Qin's Study Room)

3
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,410
(As a lawyer)

4
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,080
(what he cares about most)

5
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,360
(is undoubtedly his study room.)

6
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,950
(Because here)

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,550
(lies)

8
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,690
(his deepest logic.)

9
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,130
(I need to get close to him,)

10
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,770
(become him,)

11
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,800
(and use his logic
to solve his problems.)

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,840
(What clues did I miss?)

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,440
Young Master.

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
Uncle Fu.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,990
My dad is not here.

16
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,100
No need to change the newspaper.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,920
When Master was here,

18
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,720
I used to bring the newspaper

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,920
to the study room for him every day.

20
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,120
For so many years.

21
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,730
I got used to it.

22
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,830
Every day?

23
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,870
Yes.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,360
For over ten years.

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,560
Did he ever

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
keep the newspaper?

27
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,390
Occasionally.

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,010
Very few times.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Young Master.

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,640
I just leave.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,330
If you need anything, call me.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
Okay.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,380
(Welcome to Jiangzhou Jushangfang,
the top restaurant.)

34
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,620
(Jushangfang recreates delicacies,
first choice for celebrities.)

35
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,940

36
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,940
(Clock murder.)

37

(Jushangfang recreates delicacies,

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,420
(Jiangzhou Jushangfang,

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,380
(Jushangfang opening.)

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,920
I killed the person.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,480
The killer's knife skills and strength

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,330
are very precise.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
You are lying.

44
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,330
He is covering for the murderer.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,120
When Zhu Gengsheng, Xiao Qiance,

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
and Fat Jin died,

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
it was a single fatal blow.

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Jushangfang?

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,100
(Office)

50
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,640
Why didn't we find these?

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,950
Xiaofan.

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,500
- Captain Song.
- What's up?

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,270
You asked the Forensic Department
to re-investigate.

54
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,110
There is a new finding.

55
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,110
What finding?

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,560
The white paint used to draw the clock

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
contains isinglass,

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
the same as the last three crime scenes.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Isinglass?

60
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,500
(Inspection Report)

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,780
(Isinglass.)

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,270
Why wasn't it discovered earlier?

63
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,600
Because Qin Weilian confessed himself.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,960
So no further identification
was conducted.

65
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,580
I was just about to look for you.

66
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,000
- There's a new finding.
- There's a new finding.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,480
You go first.

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,940
(Jushangfang recreates delicacies,
first choice for celebrities.)

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Jushangfang?

70
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,290
- This is?
- Isinglass.

71
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,700
At the crime scenes
of the last three cases,

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,760
the white paint used to draw the clock
all contained isinglass.

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,590
In the entire Jiangzhou,

74
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,320
only Jushangfang produces it.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,840
It seems now

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,850
we need to focus on Jushangfang.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,480
Between the white paint
and the isinglass,

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,320
how is the layering?

79
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
The layers are distinct.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,960
The white paint bucket

81
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,090
was found at my home.

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,360
That means

83
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,210
after killing the victim,

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,120
the murderer used isinglass
to draw the clock.

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,970
Then my dad

86
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,050
coated the isinglass with white paint.

87
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,320
It is possible.

88
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
But if this possibility holds true,

89
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,150
your dad is an accomplice.

90
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,080
It is impossible.

91
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,120
Why is it impossible?

92
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
He not only harbored the murderer,

93
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,560
but also,

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,490
at the very least,
he witnessed the entire murder,

95
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,050
or he was the first to arrive
at the crime scene

96
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
after the murderer left.

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
As a lawyer,

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,680
why didn't he stop the murderer?

99
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,360
So he is possibly an accomplice.

100
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,080
You go to the prison
and settle my father first.

101
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,090
We'll meet at Jushangfang.

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,440
Bring Xiaofan along.

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,960
Rest assured.

104
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
Director Xu
has already approved the request.

105
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,730
We'll move your dad
to the safest prison cell right now.

106
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,260
(Jiangzhou Prison)

107
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Lawyer Qin,

108
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,850
you must come with us.

109
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,920
This is also for your safety.

110
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,830
Is it really necessary?

111
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,800
Huole is very sad today.

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
You saw it too.

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,560
Although I still don't know

114
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,090
how much you were involved in this case,

115
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,760
and your relationship
with the real killer,

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,790
Huole has been running around

117
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,760
for you,

118
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,910
trying to clear your name.

119
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,950
You should at least

120
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,790
appreciate his efforts.

121
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,110
It seems

122
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,880
Huole made a good friend

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
as soon as he returned.

124
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,800
This is the place.

125
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,560
I heard people talking on the train.

126
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,080
(Jushangfang)
Jushangfang's boss

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,230
is a stunning beauty

128
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,410
and a great cook.

129
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,240
It's not easy

130
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
to taste the dishes

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,990
made by Lady Gluttony.

132
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,700
Even my father has to
make a reservation in advance

133
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,560
when he invites guests.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,960
Horses need grass, and people need food.

135
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,550
We haven't eaten well
these days in the case.

136
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Captain Song,

137
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,610
shouldn't you treat us to a meal?

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,970
No problem.

139
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,760
Once we finish this case,

140
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,300
the police station canteen
will take care of us.

141
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,240
You cheapskate.

142
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,960
(Jushangfang)

143
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
Welcome,

144
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,750
please come in.

145
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,650
Come, have a seat.

146
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,090
Did you make a reservation for today?

147
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,270
I heard that your boss, Lady Gluttony,

148
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,520
is both beautiful and talented.

149
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
We came to see for ourselves today.

150
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,670
These snacks you have here

151
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,920
don't seem special.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
(Xiaoliu: Waiter of Jushangfang)
Look at what you're saying.

153
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,730
- We have...
- Xiaoliu.

154
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,380
(Su Jiangyun: Boss of Jushangfang)

155
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,530
You're not from Jiangzhou, are you?

156
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,000
People in Jiangzhou all know

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,090
the rules here.

158
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,170
If you want to eat my cooking,

159
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,230
you have to make a reservation

160
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,090
15 days in advance.

161
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,200
Otherwise,

162
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,760
you'll only get to eat

163
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,530
the common snacks.

164
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,130
We came here today to ask you something.

165
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,580
(Jiangzhou Police Station
Evidence Bag)

166
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,430
Isinglass.

167
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,240
Have you seen it before?

168
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,530
What does this mean?

169
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,630
Miss,

170
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,800
may I ask a question?

171
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,790
How long has Jushangfang

172
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,800
been open in Jiangzhou?

173
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,230
Over a year.

174
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,070
What exactly?

175
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,880
A year and two months.

176
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,830
When was the last time

177
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,790
you made isinglass?

178
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,760
Last time we...

179
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,410
About seven months ago.

180
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,920
You are asking so many questions.

181
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,650
I'm getting confused.

182
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,760
Why don't you explain your purpose,

183
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,490
so I can help you better?

184
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,760
(Issued by Jiangzhou Police Station)
I'm Song He from the detective squad.

185
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,490
So you are Captain Song from the squad.

186
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,870
I've heard a lot about you.

187
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,570
Not long ago,
there was a human clock murder.

189
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,160
contained this isinglass.

190
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
Only Jushangfang

191
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,330
makes this stuff.

192
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
That's right.

193
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,640
This isinglass is indeed

194
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,520
only made

195
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
by our Jushangfang.

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,690
However,

197
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,520
seven months ago,

198
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,160
when we made the last batch
of isinglass,

199
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,360
it was all bought

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,400
by the woodworking factory.

201
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,040
Not a bit was left?

202
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,880
This stuff is useless

203
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,000
to Jushangfang.

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,240
Why would I keep it?

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
See you next time.

206
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
I think the Lady Gluttony

207
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
is hiding something.

208
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,580
But she insisted

209
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,720
that the isinglass was all bought
by the woodworking factory.

210
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,310
Why don't we go to the factory first?

211
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,430
Maybe we'll find something.

212
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,450
Since she said so,

213
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
there will be nothing in the factory.

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,280
It must be a wasted trip.

215
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,120
Then what do you suggest?

216
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,690
The isinglass is the only clue.

217
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,610
Don't alert the enemy.

218
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,790
You go back to the station

219
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,120
to check the file on Lady Gluttony.

220
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll walk around nearby

221
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,520
to see if I can find any new clues.

222
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,360
We'll talk later.

223
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,740
(Jushangfang)

224
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,860
(First famous restaurant.
The fragrance wafts far.)

225
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,800
What do you want?

226
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,970
I'm looking for your boss.

227
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
We are closed.

228
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,200
It's urgent.

229
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,210
Sister Yun, someone has barged in!

230
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,480
Sister Yun.

231
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,850
You can leave now.

232
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,280
You have quite a refined taste.

233
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Young man.

234
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,280
You must be mistaken.

235
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,880
I opened this restaurant in Jiangzhou.

236
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,880
We sell art, not our bodies.

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,490
If you want more,

238
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,730
you'd better go to Huanyinglou.

239
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,640
I'm not here to drink wine.

240
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,930
I'm here to ask you
to clear up some confusion.

241
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
What I said this afternoon,

242
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
wasn't it clear enough?

243
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,120
When Captain Song
took out the isinglass,

244
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,430
you and your colleague
exchanged a glance.

245
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,240
He lowered his head unnaturally.

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,950
This is a behavior that occurs

247
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,480
when feeling psychologically suppressed.

248
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,400
In other words,

249
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,150
you were reminding your colleague

250
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,330
to be careful with his words.

251
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,430
When I asked you about the time

252
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,450
you last made the isinglass,

253
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,040
you answered me

254
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,880
without thinking.

255
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,400
This indicates

256
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,210
that you were lying.

257
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,570
I don't understand what you're saying.

258
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Does the clock case really
have nothing to do with you?

259
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,390
No.

260
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Alright.

261
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,810
Then let me ask you,

262
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,240
why did you

263
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,440
try to hide the time

264
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,570
you last made the isinglass?

265
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,280
Ouch, ouch!

266
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,790
It's him!

267
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,870
Let me check.

268
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,720
Captain Song, someone is causing trouble
at Jushangfang.

269
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
We caught him.

270
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,420
He says he knows you.

271
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,990
Thank you.

272
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,680
Captain.

273
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,030
Quick, untie me.

274
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
Untie me!

275
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,510
I am

276
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,760
Captain Song He

277
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,090
from the Jiangzhou detective squad.

278
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,480
This one,

279
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,690
is Chen Zheng, a member of the squad.

280
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,840
Now, regarding your attempt to molest

281
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,480
Lady Gluttonous, Jushangfang's boss,

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
we will conduct the first interrogation.

283
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,430
Please state your name

284
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,550
and date of birth.

285
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,760
When did I molest her?

286
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,600
Name!

287
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,150
My Chinese name is Qin Huole.

288
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,570
My English name is Spark.

289
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,610
You can call me Mr. Qin.

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
Chen, give us a second.

291
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,640
I want to talk to him alone.

292
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,600
Yes, Captain.

293
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,750
Go ahead.

294
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,810
Be honest.

295
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,000
I am really innocent.

296
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,950
Why would I molest her?

297
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,400
I was there for the clock case.

298
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,030
Didn't you say not to alert the enemy?

299
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,990
Why did you go directly to her?

300
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
What are your findings?

301
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,600
Hurry up and tell me.

302
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
What findings?

303
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,400
I just met her.

304
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,950
I didn't even have time to ask.

305
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,280
Then the police caught me.

306
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,680
By the way,

307
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,930
do you have any clues?

308
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
No.

309
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,490
That shouldn't be.

310
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,640
It seems this lady

311
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,970
is even more mysterious than we thought.

312
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,690
Tomorrow, you go ask my dad again.

313
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,880
I'll go meet this Lady Gluttony again.

314
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,090
Quick, untie me.

315
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,550
Let's change the place.

316
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,810
I'll sort out the clues.

317
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,930
Untie me, Brother Song.

318
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,240
You missed it.

319
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,930
Are you crazy?

320
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,110
Song He!

321
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,420
