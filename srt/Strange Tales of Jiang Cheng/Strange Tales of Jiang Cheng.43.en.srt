=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 43=

2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,180
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,930
I won't say anything.

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,090
I won't say anything.

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,090
You can stop wasting your efforts.

6
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,420
I won't say anything.

7
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,510
You're overthinking it.

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,930
We just want to give you a chance.

9
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,550
What do you mean?

10
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,210
You used various means

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,540
to manipulate Youlan to kill
Master Long,

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,090
aiming to incite internal strife
in Youlong Gambling House.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,370
This was your mission.

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,730
But actually, you don't know

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,370
what Night God wants to do.

16
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,350
That's right.

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,690
If it were me,

18
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,460
I wouldn't tell a marginal subordinate

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,300
an important secret either.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,020
You didn't expect to meet me
at Youlong Gambling House,

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,200
neither knew

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,370
that I was looking for Master Long

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,020
to investigate Night God.

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,410
Night God would definitely be wary

25
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,300
of a famous detective,

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,020
so you

27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,210
received the mission to frame me.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,810
Under Night God's instructions,

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,500
you planned to take me out of Jiangzhou.

30
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,270
I couldn't understand before

31
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,970
why you didn't just kill me.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,970
Later, I understood.

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,620
It's not that you didn't dare,

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,810
but that you couldn't.

35
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,520
Night God wants to firmly
pin the blame on me

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,340
for killing the three tigers
of Jiangzhou.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,580
If I died,

38
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,410
the police would keep tracing it.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,900
If I disappeared,

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,080
it would actually

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,930
protect you the most.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,250
The following words

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,600
might be cruel

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,580
to you,

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,250
but they are the truth.

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,130
Do you still want to hear them?

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,250
Just spit it out.

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,210
(File: Mrs. Ding. Ding Mao.)
With your mother as bait,

49
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,550
you lured the entire police force out

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,410
to capture you,

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,740
and you induced Xu Shenxing

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,780
to kill Director Xu with his own hands.

53
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,180
Night God told you to, right?

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,300
The director of the police station

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,090
died inside the police office.

56
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,370
If this gets out,

57
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,020
it will surely become a joke.

58
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,930
This is the result Night God wants.

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
And you

60
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,650
are just a pawn.

61
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,860
All of this

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,930
is not just my deduction.

63
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,370
Because we

64
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,900
have caught the person who gave you
the orders.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
Nonsense!

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,090
That's impossible.

67
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,500
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Guys.

69
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,350
Bring him in.

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,580
You're fooling me.

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,640
Do you think I'm an idiot?

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,670
Do you think you can deceive me

73
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,810
with any random person?

74
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,390
Take off his hood.

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,010
Deputy Commander.

76
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,470
Deputy Commander.

77
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Speak up.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,320
Stop resisting.

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,130
We've already known everything
we need to know.

80
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,810
If you confess voluntarily,

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,500
Captain Song promises you

82
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,150
at least

83
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,040
you can still see

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,370
your blind mother.

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,540
Is that true?

86
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,980
Speak up.

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,130
Who taught you these methods?

88
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,220
Who is the Deputy Commander?

89
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,980
And who is Night God?

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,500
It's Night God.

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
It's...

92
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,930
Who is Night God?

93
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,510
Night God.

94
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,830
Night God is someone

95
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,230
who can change the fate of Jiangzhou.

96
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,420
I am willing to follow him.

97
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,540
I can follow him forever.

98
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Now

99
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,450
tell me his true identity.

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,980
True identity...

101
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,500
True...

102
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
No.

103
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
No.

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
I can't say.

105
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,120
I can't say.

106
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,640
- Don't be afraid.
- I can't say.

107
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,480
Take your time.

108
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,370
I can't say.

109
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,390
I can't.

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
I can't.

111
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,200
- Don't be afraid.
- Move.

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
I can't.

113
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,930
Say it, who is Night God?

114
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,480
- And who is the Deputy Commander?
- I can't say.

115
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,400
Speak up.

116
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,300
Speak up.

117
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,450
I will never tell you.

118
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,340
(Night God Society. Whoever chases
shadows is a shadow himself.)

119
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,980
Shall we try again?

120
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,370
Hypnotizing Ding Mao was already
a stroke of luck.

121
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,710
Moreover,

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,660
he is now on guard against us.

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,100
He will never give us another chance.

124
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,890
I'm so sorry.

125
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
I just

126
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,860
really wanted to catch the mastermind.

127
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,250
Even if you didn't interrupt it,

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,930
he wouldn't reveal the true identity
of Night God.

129
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,790
Because of his worship and fear

130
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,630
of Night God,

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,660
he has built a psychological defense.

132
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,890
It's very hard to break through.

133
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,180
So what should we do now?

134
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,450
There is another way,

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
but

136
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,770
I'm afraid you might not agree.

137
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,930
If you don't tell me, how would
you know I won't agree?

138
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Alright.

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,810
When will my wanted notice be lifted?

140
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,550
The culprit has been caught.

141
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,230
It just needs Director Xu's signature.

142
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,270
- No need.
- I'll do it right away.

143
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,500
- What do you mean?
- Jiangzhou Prison.

144
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,680
What?

145
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,770
Hypnosis.

146
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,670
No one can master it without a teacher.

147
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,630
Ding Mao is no exception.

148
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,470
You put me in prison,

149
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,860
And I'll investigate it from the inside

150
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,010
to expose Night God.

151
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,400
Are you crazy?

152
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,640
That's tampering with records.

153
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,570
You know that.

154
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,920
The secret force has already
infiltrated Jiangzhou Prison.

155
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
If I put you in now,

156
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,550
you could die, okay?

157
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,590
Nothing venture, nothing have.

158
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,660
Stop talking nonsense.

159
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,470
If someone has to go,

160
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,860
it's gonna be me.

161
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,370
As long as I'm here,

162
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,980
you don't get to play the hero.

163
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
Song He,

164
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,120
only if I go to prison now

165
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,310
will it not arouse suspicion.

166
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,110
Moreover, Night God is good at
psychology.

167
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,670
Only I have a chance to contend
with him.

168
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,560
So it has to be me.

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,540
Absolutely no.

170
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,060
Right, you can't.

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,540
It's really too dangerous.

172
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,010
You can't go.

173
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,500
Do we have any other options now?

174
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,470
Night God

175
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,830
has already attempted to assassinate

176
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,310
Director Xu at the office.

177
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,360
What if next time they aim to kill
Commander Lei?

178
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
He wants the entire Jiangzhou.

179
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,790
By that time,

180
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,060
how do we stop him?

181
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,770
I am just like you.

182
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,940
I was born here.

183
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,340
I love this place.

184
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,050
I want to protect it.

185
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,700
That's why I became a police officer.

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Mr. Qin.

187
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,350
Dad.

188
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,650
Thank you, Captain Song.

189
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,940
Didn't you promise

190
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,820
to come back to me safely?

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,390
The case has been closed.

192
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,620
Why are you in prison now?

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,640
Dad,

194
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,820
please don't worry.

195
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,580
Actually, I go to prison

196
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,700
to complete a mission.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
Complete a mission?

198
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,070
What mission?

199
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,410
I can't tell you now.

200
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,290
But I need your help.

201
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,050
I remember a mentor of yours

202
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,370
is a senior reformist.

203
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,770
Mr. Guan Boling?

204
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
What about him?

205
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,710
Can he

206
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,620
handle it alone?

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,980
Everyone has their own duties.

208
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,040
Just like Commander Lei.

209
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
He needs to lead Lei's Army

210
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,650
to resist Chen Biao's forces.

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,980
We must also capture Night God

212
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,550
and uproot

213
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,650
the secret force

214
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,740
lurking in Jiangzhou.

215
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,350
Let's work together.

216
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,470
Is that okay, Dad?

217
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,410
If you are willing to help me,

218
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,640
just nod your head.

219
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,980
If you are not willing,

220
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,860
I will find another way.

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
I can

222
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,800
help you,

223
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,220
but you must promise

224
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,860
to come home safely.

225
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
I promise.

226
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,560
You are not going to a market.

227
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,740
It's a prison

228
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,460
that accommodates all kinds of people.

229
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,250
I don't know if you can endure it.

230
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,700
You're too reckless.

231
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,390
Don't lecture me.

232
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,720
When I was abroad,

233
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,170
the outstanding Lawyer Qin

234
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,530
also did many reckless things.

235
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
The first thing I did when I returned

236
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,220
was to get you out of prison.

237
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Now look at you,

238
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,280
you've thrown away

239
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,010
your responsibilities completely.

240
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,600
The people in Jiangzhou have said

241
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,480
that it's a pity

242
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,740
Lawyer Qin doesn't take cases anymore.

243
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,290
How can that be the same?

244
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,560
I stopped taking cases

245
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,600
because I felt like what I did

246
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,770
was just a drop in the bucket.

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,620
You're different.

248
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
You have a promising future.

249
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
Dad,

250
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
my future

251
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,340
lies on this land.

252
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,400
Alright.

253
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,460
I will fulfill

254
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
what I promised you.

255
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,050
You also have to finish

256
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,400
what you promised me.

257
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Two words.

258
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,130
Go home.

259
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,470
Okay.

260
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,250
- Xiaofan.
- Come in.

261
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,710
Someone is looking for you.

262
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,440
Zou Jing,

263
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
why are you here?

264
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,600
Miss, it's already late.

265
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
The Commander is worried about you.

266
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
He ordered me to bring you back
to the mansion.

267
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,910
It's early.

268
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,870
Besides, if my father wants me
to go back,

269
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,120
he can just call me.

270
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,680
There's no need for you to come.

271
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,770
The Commander asked me

272
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,340
to personally bring you back.

273
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,370
Did something happen at home?

274
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,640
No, nothing.

275
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,910
The Commander is worried
that you are overworked,

276
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,130
and Jiangzhou has been unstable recently.

277
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,700
He ordered me to protect you.

278
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,700
My father is really

279
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
making a fuss over me.

280
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
Xiaofan,

281
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
why don't you go back?

282
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,030
Don't let Commander Lei worry.

283
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,170
Then I'll leave first.

284
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,070
Go.

285
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,540
(Governor's Mansion)

286
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,530
Father, aunt.

287
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,520
I'm back.

288
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,530
What happened?

289
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,740
Sweetie,

290
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,410
half an hour ago,

291
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,960
Chen Biao's troops

292
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,650
invaded Ningcheng.

293
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
Jiangzhou

294
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,500
will be his next target.

295
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,870
Xiaofan,

296
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,320
this is why your father

297
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,050
had Lieutenant Zou bring you back.

298
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,740
What do you mean?

299
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Your father

300
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,740
wants to send you away from Jiangzhou.

301
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,980
Father!

302
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,350
Sweetie,

303
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,620
once Chen Biao

304
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,200
starts the war,

305
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,910
I won't be able to ensure your safety.

306
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,990
So I'll send someone

307
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,130
to take you to Shanghai.

308
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,720
Hurry up and eat,

309
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,250
then pack your things quickly

310
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,250
and leave tonight.

311
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
No, I won't go.

312
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,370
Xiaofan, be good.

313
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,630
This time, Chen Biao is coming on strong.

314
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,760
My father stays in our hometown

315
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,860
to fight the enemy to the death.

316
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,220
My friends and colleagues

317
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,630
are all fighting to protect Jiangzhou.

318
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,620
Should I just

319
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,650
leave you all behind and go?

320
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,720
Do I still deserve
to be Lei Hai's daughter?

321
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,560
Good.

322
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,370
That's my girl.

323
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,530
But today, you must leave.

324
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,040
Father.

325
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,440
Xiaofan.

326
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,870
You must understand. Your father
only has one daughter.

327
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,770
And I only have one father.

328
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
My dear girl,

329
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,560
sit down.

330
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
Sit down and listen to me.

331
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,160
Sit.

332
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,200
As long as you're safe,

333
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,460
I won't lose.

334
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,250
Once I deal with that rat,

335
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,340
I'll immediately send someone
to bring you back.

336
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Be good.

337
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,830
Father.

338
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,220
I'll listen to you.

339
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,860
But I can't leave tonight.

340
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,640
Three days.

341
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,340
You must leave in three days.

342
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,740
These days,

343
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,290
don't go to the police station.

344
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Stay home with me

345
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,130
and talk with your aunt.

346
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,110
Let's have dinner.

347
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,060
