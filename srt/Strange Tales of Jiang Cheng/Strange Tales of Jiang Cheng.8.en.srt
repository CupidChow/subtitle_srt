=Episode 8=

2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,220
(Jushangfang)

3
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,350
Steamed buns.

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,450
Freshly baked steamed buns.

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,170
Why is it you again?

6
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,520
Are you trying to make advances

7
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,360
on our boss again?

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,320
It's really a misunderstanding.

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm here to apologize today.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,490
There's no need for that.

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,550
Please leave.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
Xiaoliu,

13
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,410
let the guest come up.

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,470
Yes, Sister Yun.

15
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,950
Captain Chen,

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,490
I wonder if it's okay,

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,200
I'd like to talk to Lawyer Qin alone.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,160
I'll wait for you outside.

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,400
Regarding your case,

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,960
we have new clues.

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Captain Song,

22
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,200
I don't quite understand.

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,590
You were the one

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,080
who personally arrested me back then.

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,870
Why are you now so eager

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,520
to overturn my case

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,450
with Huole?

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,800
Because arresting you

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,870
was not my real goal.

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,960
Catching the real culprit is.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
We have discovered that

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
the human clock

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,990
was originally painted with isinglass,

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,850
and then applied with the white paint.

35
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,290
It seems you're not interested.

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,150
It doesn't matter.

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,590
Huole has already traced the source
of the isinglass.

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,800
He is on his way there now,

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,770
and should have results soon.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,640
Where did Huole go?

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,570
Why are you in such a hurry?

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
Go find him now and tell him

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
that I am the culprit.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,480
Tell him to leave Jiangzhou immediately,

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
and never interfere with it again.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,730
What are you afraid of?

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,830
Jushangfang?

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,360
Or the boss of Jushangfang?

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,110
Stop talking.

50
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,950
Go quickly,

51
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,360
or it will be too late.

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,010
Hurry up!

53
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,860
(Jushangfang)

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,460
(Fragrance wafts far.)

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:55,100
(Closed)

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Sir, what brings you here today?

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,960
If I don't see you,

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,330
will you force your way in again?

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
For my dad.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
What? Do I know your dad?

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't you?

62
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,050
So it was you.

63
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,860
Come to have a look.

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,490
We met before?

65
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,640
Five years ago,

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,050
you stayed at Lawyer Qin's house,

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
right?

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
So, you are...

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,800
Qin Weilian's son,

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,170
Qin Huole.

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,610
I've dealt with

72
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,800
most of the notable figures
in Jiangzhou.

73
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,440
But it was all just for fun.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,800
I am not familiar with your father.

75
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,320
No matter what you ask,

76
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm afraid you've got the wrong person.

77
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,630
Not familiar?

78
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,910
Would a man take the blame
for a stranger?

79
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,520
Even if he's about to be executed,

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
he still protects the culprit.

81
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,600
Lady,

82
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,600
you just watched all this happen.

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,920
Isn't that too heartless and ungrateful?

84
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,530
I don't understand what you're saying.

85
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,480
How did you drive?

86
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,440
Song He?

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,280
Why are you here?

88
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,170
Xiaofan?

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,730
Quick, take me to Jushangfang.

90
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,000
Fat Jin, Zhu Gengsheng,

91
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,090
and Xiao Qiance,

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,990
all were killed
with a single fatal blow.

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,550
There were no other wounds
on their bodies.

94
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,470
This indicates the culprit's knife skills
are precise.

95
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,360
And your knife skills are very proficient,

96
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,730
with great strength.

97
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm a cook.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,350
Am I not supposed to be so?

99
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,360
But the isinglass

100
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,440
is only sold at Jushangfang.

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,210
Jushangfang has been open for so long

102
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,210
and has sold a lot of isinglass.

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Who knows

104
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,680
where the culprit got it from?

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,610
Now I understand

106
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,760
why you were so nervous

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,090
when we came to check the isinglass,

108
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,920
and even lied deliberately.

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,440
You are good at telling stories,

110
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,320
but it's all your imagination.

111
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,500
All the clues point to you.

112
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,680
You cannot escape your connection

113
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
to this case.

114
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,750
And my dad,

115
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,730
the person he protected with his life,

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,040
is you.

117
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,210
The police station has already concluded,

118
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,530
that Qin Weilian is the real culprit.

119
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,190
Why do you keep saying

120
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,320
he was covering for someone else?

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,410
Is it just because he is your dad?

122
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,290
You killed so many people.

123
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,090
Yet the police have never come after you.

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Do you know why?

125
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,000
Because my father

126
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,910
always used white paint

127
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,210
to cover your isinglass.

128
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,680
Come back with me and turn yourself in.

129
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
You can't escape.

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
When did I ever say I was going to run?

131
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,490
Do you know?

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,560
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

133
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
We have no personal grudge.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
But you are Qin Weilian's son.

135
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,360
Qin Weilian is hiding in prison.

136
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,410
I can't kill him.

137
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,970
So you will pay the debt
for your father.

138
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,870
I...

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,170
I only have one question.

140
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,670
When did you meet my dad?

141
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,760
What kind of grudge is there?

142
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,870
And

143
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,870
those people,

144
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,560
why did you kill them?

145
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,090
That's not just one question.

146
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,730
Anyway, I'm going to die.

147
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
I would rather know the truth.

148
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,310
Could it be

149
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,350
that my dad abandoned you?

150
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,120
If you keep talking nonsense,
I'll kill you right now!

151
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Alright, I won't say anymore.

152
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,170
You want to know the truth?

153
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,410
Then I'll tell you.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Back then,

155
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
Tuo Hailin, Master Tuo,

156
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,640
also known as bandit
Little Ghost Chaser,

157
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,800
brought his butler Jin Pang,

158
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,100
(Su Residence)
to my home,

159
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,520
wanting to forcefully marry me.

160
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,570
I wanted a proper marriage.

161
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
(Tuo Hailin. Jin Pang.)
Don't be ungrateful.

162
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,270
Master Tuo,

163
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,590
please show mercy,

164
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,790
and spare us.

165
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,520
Besides, Jiangyun has already

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,970
(Father Su)
gone studying in Wuhan.

167
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,600
She can't be back now.

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,760
Can't be back?

169
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,040
I've already set the date.

170
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,520
The invitations have been sent out.

171
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,450
Are you trying to embarrass me?

172
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,400
Master Tuo,

173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,570
this marriage

174
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,210
is indeed inappropriate.

175
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,110
You...

176
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,480
Since you don't want

177
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,040
to marry me,

178
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,240
then let's become enemies.

179
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,640
Fat Jin!

180
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,720
- Here.
- Do it!

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,570
Alright, guys, do it!

182
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,630
Do it!

183
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,490
Xiaoliu and I went to the police.

184
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,270
At that time, Xiao Qiance,
the presiding judge,

185
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,760
he promised to help me seek justice.

186
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,000
He had Xiaoliu stay there
to record the statement.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
But he took me to his own home.

188
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
He told me,

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,190
if Little Ghost Chaser knew

190
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,280
that I was still alive,

191
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,850
he would definitely kill me.

192
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
He suggested I stay at his house.

193
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,840
(Xiao Residence)

194
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
At that time, I thought

195
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,090
I had met an honest official.

196
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,730
I was really too naive.

197
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,900
(Xiao Qiance, presiding judge)

198
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,320
Mr. Xiao,

199
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,790
what are you doing?

200
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,630
Get up.

201
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
Let go of me!

202
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,630
Mr. Xiao,

203
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,120
Miss Jiangyun,

204
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,450
why can't you think it through?

205
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,280
As long as you become my woman,

206
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,810
I will definitely seek revenge for you.

207
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,120
Mr. Xiao, don't do this.

208
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Don't come closer.

209
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,790
Miss Jiangyun,

210
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,730
just be my woman.

211
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,400
Ungrateful woman.

212
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,450
What bad luck.

213
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,450
To tell you the truth,

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,120
the Master Tuo you want to accuse

215
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,610
is an old friend of mine.

216
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,160
How could I help you overturn the case?

217
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,110
Dream on it.

218
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
Maybe it was my family

219
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,120
protecting me from above.

220
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,610
I didn't die.

221
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,330
After regaining consciousness, I escaped
from Xiao Qiance's house overnight.

222
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,210
Xiao Qiance is a scoundrel.

223
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,880
He deserves to die a thousand times.

224
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,030
Later,

225
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,760
I tried every possible way

226
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,120
to report the case
to Mayor Zhu Gengsheng.

227
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,550
He was the highest official
in Jiangzhou at that time.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,190
After hearing my story,

229
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,090
he immediately arrested
Little Ghost Chaser.

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
I thought this time,

231
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,310
the injustice my family suffered

232
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,970
would finally be redressed.

233
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,880
But...

234
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,930
Miss Jiangyun,

235
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,840
(Zhu Gengsheng, mayor)
although we caught him,

236
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,490
we caught the wrong person.

237
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,640
What did you say?

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
Master Tuo

239
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,330
did not kill your family.

240
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,400
Xiaoliu and I saw him
kill my entire family with our own eyes.

241
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,000
Even if he were reduced to ashes,

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,280
I would still recognize him.

243
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,360
You are the family member of the victim.

244
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,400
Xiaoliu is your household servant.

245
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,970
The testimonies of you two.

246
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,640
(Presiding judge)

247
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
How can I make a judgment?

248
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,880
On the day of the incident,

249
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,110
Master Tuo was at home,

250
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,400
playing chess with a friend.

251
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
He did not step out of
the study room even once.

252
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,450
Then who can testify for him?

253
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,510
Me.

254
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,000
I can testify.

255
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,880
The one playing chess with him that day,

256
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
was exactly me.

257
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,120
I met Zhu Gengsheng before.

258
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,760
He is a kind-looking elder.

259
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
I didn't expect
he was also bribed by Master Tuo.

260
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,210
He is truly a hypocrite.

261
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,840
Your father, Qin Weilian,

262
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,910
is the top hypocrite

263
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,210
in Jiangzhou.

264
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,910
Lawyer Qin.

265
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,550
What are you doing?

266
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,760
Let me finish speaking.

267
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,280
Everyone says you are the best lawyer

268
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,610
in Jiangzhou,

269
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,570
fearless of power, only for justice.

270
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,810
Those people are utterly heartless.

271
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,120
I beg you,

272
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,950
please help me.

273
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,000
Please help me!

274
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,930
Get up, please.

275
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,280
Get up.

276
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,490
Let the culprit receive legal punishment,

277
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,210
and let the victim receive justice.

278
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,850
This is what a lawyer should do.

279
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,810
I will

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
take your case.

281
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,570
You should be able to guess

282
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,520
what happened next.

283
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,000
My dad would never be like those people.

284
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,550
He said he would help you,

285
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,520
and he definitely will.

286
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,240
Of course, he is different.

287
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,210
Because he is even more detestable!

288
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,610
I heard,

289
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
Qin Weilian is an overseas doctor.

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,190
The legal fees for a lawsuit,

291
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,120
are very expensive.

292
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,570
At that time, I was penniless.

293
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,850
Since I've come this far,

294
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,930
I decided to offer myself.

295
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,180
(Plaintiff: Su Jiangyun, Xiaoliu)

296
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,420
(Defendants: Tuo Hailin, Xiao Qiance,
Zhu Gengsheng. Lawyer: Qin Weilian)

297
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Lawyer Qin.

298
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,630
You...

299
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,360
I know it is not easy.

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
I have nothing

301
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,850
to thank you for.

302
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,160
I am willing to offer myself to you.

303
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,490
Miss Jiangyun.

304
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
What are you doing?

305
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,880
What do you take me for?

306
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,280
I am helping you seek justice.

307
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,450
That comes from the conscience
of a lawyer.

308
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,850
Everyone will experience misfortune.

309
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,360
But the most important thing

310
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,360
is to learn to cherish yourself.

311
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,450
I kept you at home

312
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,950
just to protect

313
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,790
your personal safety.

314
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,160
I had no other intentions.

315
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,810
If you want to seek justice
for your families,

316
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,610
you must not do this again.

317
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
So that's how it is.

318
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
It seems I misunderstood him.

319
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
But my dad is a good person.

320
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,880
Why do you hate him so much?

321
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,790
When I was in my most desperate moment,

322
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,880
he gave me hope.

323
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,720
He made me

324
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,490
have one last fantasy about this world.

325
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,640
Then he shattered

326
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,570
my hope.

327
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,920
He made me feel like

328
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,810
I was the most foolish person.

329
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,210
He is the most detestable one.

330
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,660
