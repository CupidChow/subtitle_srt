=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 4=

2
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,990
Don't be afraid.

3
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,530
I can even handle
the pressure ignition device.

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,740
This is no big deal.

5
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,300
Captain Song told me

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
you are very brave.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Captain.

8
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,940
I, I'm not afraid.

9
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,300
This guy is spying on us.

10
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,140
Somewhere in the corner
opposite the window.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Don't move.

12
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,920
Don't look outside the window.

13
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,580
Don't let him notice.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,530
Mao Shuai, Chen Zheng.

15
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,870
Yes!

16
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,100
You do have some skills.

17
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,310
Captain Song.

18
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,020
You can go catch him now.

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,220
It's best not to leave
through the front door.

20
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,390
Remember.

21
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,970
Be very careful.

22
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,110
You all be careful too.

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,690
Help me hold the bomb.

24
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,180
I've already disarmed it.

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Trust me.

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,290
Don't be nervous.

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,660
Don't touch the fuse.

28
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
Okay.

29
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,110
Relax.

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Relax.

31
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Succeed.

32
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,060
(Walking for the Innocent)

33
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,250
At the police station,

34
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,180
he escaped again.

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,290
He already predicted the outcome.

36
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,710
Captain.

37
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
How is it?

38
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
Captain.

39
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,610
Wu found a suspect

40
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,000
in the small white building

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,610
based on Detective Qin's analysis.

42
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,960
His name is Ma Xiaonian.

43
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,200
He used to be a worker
at the suburban cotton mill.

44
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,030
A few years ago, because he stole

45
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,350
a few rolls of yarn from the factory.

46
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,230
He was reported and caught by the squad.

47
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,660
This wasn't a big deal.

48
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,790
Cheng Tianlang and his gang.

49
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,080
The gang's habitual thieves

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,700
are caught and released.

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,050
But this kid was unlucky.

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,250
He happened to run into

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,350
Commander Lei was cracking down

54
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,370
on crime at that time.

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,710
As a result, he was put on a prison cart

56
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,440
parading through the streets
of Jiangzhou.

57
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,340
So many criminals.

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,730
Why chose him?

59
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,490
Because this kid is an orphan.

60
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,560
His adoptive father was an executioner
in the Qing Dynasty,

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,680
who killed many people in his lifetime.

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,530
In Jiangzhou,

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,220
reputation is very important.

64
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,020
We just need a criminal.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,530
He just got caught up in it.

66
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,660
Later, he came to the police station
to make trouble.

67
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,900
But no one paid attention.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,610
Initiate a citywide manhunt immediately.

69
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,670
Yes!

70
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,260
He was just here a moment ago

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
watching us

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,050
fall into his trap step by step.

73
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,880
He wants to see us

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,170
blown to pieces.

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,970
This beast!

76
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,190
Do you know

77
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,960
the biggest difference between us

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,370
and the criminals?

79
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,630
What are you trying to say?

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,960
Crime

81
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,900
is their whole life.

82
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,990
But we

83
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,930
have our own lives.

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,460
My life

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,100
is to catch these criminals

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,100
and make sure
there is no more injustice.

87
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,870
Captain.

88
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,550
What's wrong?

89
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
- A letter.
- What letter?

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Ma Xiaonian.

91
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,200
Ma Xiaonian?

92
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,870
How was it delivered?

93
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,140
A little beggar gave it to me.

94
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,430
Horrid man!

95
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,370
If you want to see me,

96
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,760
let that pretty female forensic doctor

97
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,260
come to Wuyi Lane at 8 p.m. tonight.

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,700
If she doesn't show up,

99
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,520
I'll find another fun place

100
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,390
to test

101
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,530
my new bomb.

102
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,170
She can't go.

103
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
It's too dangerous.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,600
No.

105
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
I'll go.

106
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,510
I want to go.

107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,320
I want to catch him myself.

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,710
And end this crisis in Jiangzhou.

109
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,800
If you don't agree,

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,780
I'll report to the director.

111
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,600
I believe that he will agree

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,440
with me.

113
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,310
Alright.

114
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,580
I know you don't want me
to take the risk.

115
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,580
But we have no other choice now.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,460
Ma Xiaonian is ruthless

117
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,020
and meticulous.

118
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,530
Neither Captain Song nor I
are completely confident.

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,340
If anything goes wrong,

120
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,700
you might lose your life.

121
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Look,

122
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,460
I have anesthetics in here.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,020
If Ma Xiaonian encounters me,

124
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,230
he will only be unlucky.

125
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,640
Why don't we think of another way?

126
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,020
I know it's difficult for you.

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,820
You're afraid that
if you don't agree with Ma Xiaonian,

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,710
he will go on an explosion again.

129
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,200
But if Xiaofan gets hurt,

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,490
or falls into Ma Xiaonian's hands,

131
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,410
that's also something
we don't want to see.

132
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
I understand Xiaofan.

133
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,020
Standing behind us,

134
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,320
are the unarmed civilians of Jiangzhou.

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,610
Even if we have to sacrifice our lives,

136
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,530
we must protect their safety.

137
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,020
This is my lifelong pursuit,

138
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,140
and ideal.

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,410
As soon as Ma Xiaonian shows up,

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
shoot immediately.

141
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,230
Don't worry.

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
Let's go.

143
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,990
Speak up.

144
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,430
What is your plan?

145
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,850
I found Commander Lei's lieutenant
Zou Jin,

146
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,420
and borrowed some men.

147
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,890
There's an operation tonight

148
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,180
at Wuyi Lane.

149
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,440
Lend me a few soldiers.

150
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,490
I need some new faces.

151
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,200
The commander is at Yuan Lake tonight
to offer sacrifices to the river god,

152
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,410
praying for the people of Jiangzhou.

153
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,100
The entire area within ten miles
will be sealed off.

154
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,950
I can't help you with this.

155
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,830
I don't have the manpower.

156
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,250
You must lend me those soldiers.

157
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,990
Wait a minute.

158
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,600
You just said Commander Lei
is offering sacrifices to the river god.

159
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,040
when is that?

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,540
- What's wrong?
- What time?

161
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,670
Eight o'clock.

162
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,550
Eight o'clock?

163
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,730
If you want to see me,

164
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,350
let that pretty female forensic doctor,

165
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,730
come to Wuyi Lane
at eight o'clock tonight.

166
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,820
Ma Xiaonian also set the meeting
with us at eight o'clock.

167
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,890
I suspect Ma Xiaonian's

168
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,710
real target is Commander Lei.

169
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,130
Because of Commander Lei's
order back then,

170
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,960
Ma Xiaonian was paraded
through the streets.

171
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,010
This is a diversion.

172
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,300
So he's not here at all.

173
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,650
He's at Yuan Lake.

174
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,180
It's already 7:50 now.

175
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,460
You two, quickly go after Xiaofan

176
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,960
and bring her to Yuan Lake to meet us.

177
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,800
Yes!

178
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,780
(Yuan Lake)

179
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,940
(Lei)

180
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,460
(Lei Hai, Commander of Jiangzhou)

181
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,230
- Stop!
- Stop! Stop!

182
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,110
- Zou Jin.
- Who's there?

183
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,950
Put it down.

184
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,350
Why are you here?

185
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,220
Aren't you supposed
to be protecting Xiao Fan at Wuyi Lane?

186
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,300
Commander Lei is in danger.

187
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,110
I can't explain it all to you right now.

188
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,950
I need to see him.

189
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,550
No way.

190
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,320
The commander is very concerned
about this ceremony.

191
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
If we disturb him,

192
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,350
not only you but even my head
won't be safe.

193
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,540
That guy is a maniac.

194
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,960
He has a grudge
against Commander Lei.

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
He's here for revenge.

196
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,450
Calm down first.

197
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,150
I'll take responsibility
for the commander's safety.

198
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,080
(Zou Jin, Lei Hai's lieutenant)
You go back and protect Xiaofan.

199
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
If anything happens to her,

200
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,060
I'll hold you accountable.

201
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,420
What are you doing?

202
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,010
I'm telling you, Song He,

203
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,490
don't make things difficult for me.

204
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,460
Don't shoot. He's my friend.

205
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,670
Trust me.

206
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,370
I wouldn't joke
about Commander's life.

207
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
Trust me.

208
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,340
Put the gun down.

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,010
Don't disturb the river god.

210
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,760
Then what should we do?

211
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,730
- Chase him.
- Yes!

212
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,510
Team one, follow me.

213
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,350
Yes!

214
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,710
Remember,

215
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,970
based on my analysis of Ma Xiaonian,

216
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,700
he will definitely be waiting
near Yuan Lake

217
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,480
to personally watch the bomb explosion.

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,420
Commander Lei, hello.

219
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,800
I didn't expect

220
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
to meet you under such circumstances.

221
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,040
My name is Qin Huole.

222
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,970
Qin Huole?

223
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,970
Never heard of you.

224
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,060
I'm just a small figure.

225
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,700
You surely haven't heard of me.

226
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,830
But,

227
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm here to save you today.

228
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,970
We are hunting a bomb maniac,

229
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,630
but he has escaped multiple times.

230
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,680
I just analyzed that

231
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,350
he will retaliate against you tonight.

232
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,370
The bomb is on this boat.

233
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,890
But it's too late to find it now.

234
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,440
You must jump into the water
and leave immediately.

235
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,250
I know it's hard to believe
what I just said,

236
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,300
but there's no time to explain now.

237
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,970
Because this concerns your life.

238
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,950
No.

239
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,650
I believe

240
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,250
what you said,

241
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,650
but I don't trust you.

242
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
I am the most reasonable person.

243
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
For my safety,

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,940
how about we do this?

245
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,420
I shoot

246
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,640
and kill you.

247
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,940
Commander, I...

248
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,340
- Commander!
- Commander!

249
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Commander!

250
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,220
- Commander!
- Commander!

251
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,040
Move aside.

252
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,730
Lieutenant Zou, where is my father?

253
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,460
