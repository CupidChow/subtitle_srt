2
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,940
The incense sticks

3
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,660
were probably lit by that person just now.

4
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,100
The purpose is

5
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,660
to create a sight obstruction for us,

6
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,700
making it easier for him

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,060
to assassinate one of us.

8
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,380
Are you saying

9
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,500
that he wants to kill one of us,

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,060
but didn't expect there to be
three of us?

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,900
Right.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,820
Where is Miss Huanyang?

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,460
She doesn't know anyone in Jiangzhou.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,260
The talisman was only half drawn.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,100
It's obvious

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,540
that she met something urgent.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,580
Could she be kidnapped?

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,580
Probably not.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,900
Why?

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,140
If she were kidnapped,

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,500
how could the brush pen

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,900
be neatly placed on the inkstone?

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,740
Besides,

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,940
even if it were a kidnapping,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,500
it would likely be done
by someone she knows.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,740
Right, it makes sense.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,020
I get it.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,620
By the way,

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,940
have you seen this before?

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,660
This looks like

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
a feather from some bird.

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,220
Let's check the bird market.

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,180
I'll go. I'm familiar
with all walks of life.

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,820
I'll go to the bird market.

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,580
Gentlemen.

36
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,220
As soon as I get any information,

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,180
I'll tell you immediately.

38
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,820
Thank you for today.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,540
Goodbye.

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,300
This Gu Sui is quite interesting.

41
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,980
His skills are indeed impressive.

42
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,860
But if I was to have a proper match
with him,

43
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,220
I definitely wouldn't lose to him.

44
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,220
Yes, yes.

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Our Captain Song

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,780
is the most brave and mighty.

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,700
Why don't we start with Zhuang Si

48
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,540
to find a breakthrough?

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,780
I gave him

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,700
a good scare today

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,980
to lure him out of his hole,

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,100
so that he goes to meet with the killer.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,020
It's a plan.

54
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,620
But given Zhuang Si's status,

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,300
he might not meet him personally again.

56
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
So what should we do?

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,380
Gu Sui has said

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,140
that the killer had a mole
on his right cheek

59
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,980
and wore a silver ring
on the left pinkie finger.

60
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,140
So,

61
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,780
let's go to the gambling house.

62
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,980
Gambling house?

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,980
Right.

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
From a superstitious perspective,

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,620
people wear rings their pinkie fingers

66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,900
to prevent financial loss.

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,300
Only gamblers

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,380
would care about this, right?

69
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,220
How do you know everything?

70
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,940
Don't forget. I am

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,100
- Detective Qin.
- Alright, Detective Qin.

72
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,500
If you're so capable,

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,980
how come you didn't foresee
Cheng Tianlang

74
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,380
almost broke your arm today?

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,620
I'm a mind reader,

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,540
not a fortune teller.

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,060
I think they are the same.

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,940
(Youlong Gambling House)

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,700
This is the last one
in the north of the city.

80
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm sure

81
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,620
we'll find something here.

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,780
(Youlong Gambling House)

83
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,260
Alright, alright, raise your hand.

84
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
Small, small.

85
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,700
Bet big.

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,100
Bet big.

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,580
Why is it big again?

88
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,420
Yeah.

89
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,820
- Small.
- Big, big!

90
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,500
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

91
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,020
- Open.
- Come on.

92
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,980
Five points. It's small.

93
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,740
You're here.

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,140
Sorry, wrong person.

95
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,350
Small? I'm betting big.

96
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,560
- Come on, here you are.
- Give me the money.

97
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,900
- Yours.
- It must be big.

98
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,740
This is yours.

99
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,100
Let's go for another round.

100
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,980
Place your bets.

101
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,380
Place your bets.

102
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,180
Anyone else wants to place a bet?

103
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,500
- Small.
- Place your bets.

104
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,740
Place your bets.

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Open.

106
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,180
- Big.
- Open.

107
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,460
Small.

108
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,620
Small.

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,020
- Good, good!
- Small.

110
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,260
Small.

111
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,380
Twelve points. It's big.

112
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,220
Come on, give me the money.

113
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,900
Place your bets.

114
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,740
Small.

115
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,740
- Small.
- Big.

116
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,820
- Small.
- Fifteen points. It's big.

117
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,100
Come on, give me the money.

118
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,060
Small.

119
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,220
Sixteen points.

120
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,220
It's big.

121
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,740
You have really good luck.

122
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,180
Here, this is yours.

123
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,380
This is yours.

124
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,500
This gentleman,

125
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,020
you not only look good,

126
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,340
but also have good luck.

127
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,820
Come on, let's go again.

128
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,100
Place your bets.

129
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,180
Place your bets now.

130
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,420
Big or small?

131
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,380
Anyone else?

132
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,780
Place your bets.

133
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,820
Place your bets now.

134
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,900
All in on small.

135
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
Alright.

136
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,060
Open.

137
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
Small, small.

138
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,780
- Small.
- Thirteen points. It's big.

139
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,830
You got to be kidding.

140
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,580
Congratulations.

141
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,010
Darn it.

142
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,420
Here, this is yours.

143
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Why didn't you let me catch him?

144
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,780
Because he is a killer.

145
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,020
I'm worried about your safety.

146
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,700
- But...
- What I mean is,

147
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,420
without using force,

148
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,980
I have a way to solve the problem.

149
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Otherwise,

150
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,260
I wouldn't have wasted my time

151
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,460
playing with him for so long.

152
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,480
Now, bread, cheese,

153
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,580
condensed milk and vegetables

154
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,420
are all ready.

155
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,780
I should make you a sandwich.

156
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,820
You've wasted enough time. Let's go.

157
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,620
I don't like eating leftovers.

158
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,220
(Youlong Gambling House)

159
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,060
Stop looking around.

160
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,540
He must not have gone far.

161
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,820
Don't blow our cover.

162
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,100
Friend.

163
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,140
Gambling is just for fun.

164
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,740
Winning or losing is just luck.

165
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
No need to do this.

166
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,860
Alright, shut up.

167
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,020
We all have two shoulders

168
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,060
and one head.

169
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,940
Why did you always win

170
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,780
whatever you bet on?

171
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,980
Is that all?

172
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,460
I told you.

173
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,580
It's luck.

174
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,060
I don't believe it.

175
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
You must have some secret.

176
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,900
I can tell you.

177
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,380
How much will you pay?

178
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,460
I knew

179
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,220
there must be a trick.

180
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,540
How about this?

181
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,940
Just tell me the method

182
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
and you can name your price.

183
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,620
Name my price?

184
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,260
Do you think you own a bank?

185
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,820
What?

186
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,260
Want to fight?

187
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,660
No.

188
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
What I mean is,

189
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,740
just tell me the method

190
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,020
and you can cut off

191
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,140
any part of my body

192
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,220
as you want.

193
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,100
I won't make a sound.

194
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,460
Alright.

195
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,500
You are straightforward.

196
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,140
Just for your persistence,

197
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,660
I can give it to you.

198
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,620
Give me what?

199
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,100
A talisman?

200
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,060
Is there really such a talisman
in this world?

201
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,700
I always thought charlatans made it up.

202
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,980
Most of them are fake.

203
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,420
But this one is genuine.

204
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,660
You just saw it.

205
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,900
I win every round.

206
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,700
Name your price.

207
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,820
I can do that.

208
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,140
But there's a problem.

209
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,060
What problem? Speak.

210
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,140
This talisman

211
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,220
is dedicated to Immortal Lyu.

212
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,780
He has a very peculiar temper.

213
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,180
He only helps

214
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,220
those who respect him

215
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,620
from their hearts.

216
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,700
So, I need to test you first.

217
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,700
We need to make an agreement first.

218
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,220
If Immortal Lyu doesn't recognize you,

219
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,460
even if you give me a gold mountain,

220
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,380
I won't sell it to you.

221
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,820
Understood. Ask away.

222
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,940
Right now, my mind

223
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,780
is full of respect.

224
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,620
Alright.

225
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,100
I won't make it difficult for you.

226
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Just a few casual questions.

227
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,340
Tonight,

228
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,300
how many gambling houses did you go?

229
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,540
Immortal Lyu, two.

230
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,980
The other one is
in the west of the city,

231
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,140
called Changsheng Gambling House.

232
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,260
What about last night?

233
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,780
I didn't go to any gambling house
last night.

234
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,620
You didn't?

235
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,540
Impossible.

236
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,340
I swear to Immortal Lyu.

237
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,260
I really didn't go.

238
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,060
Then where did you go?

239
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,050
Huanyinglou.

240
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,900
Which girl did you see?

241
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,900
I didn't see any girl.

242
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,020
You didn't?

243
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,580
Did you hear that?

244
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,620
Someone went to Huanyinglou

245
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,060
but didn't see any girl.
Do you believe that?

246
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,500
I really didn't see any girl.

247
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,020
I took a business deal last night.

248
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,620
I wasn't there for a girl at all.

249
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,460
Did the deal go through?

250
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,340
Don't mention it.

251
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,700
It was a good deal,

252
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,060
but I was unlucky.

253
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,420
Someone else snatched it away.

254
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,750
Unlucky me.

255
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,620
Are you saying
when you went to kill Xu Shenxing,

256
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,500
he was already dead?

257
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,580
Exactly.

258
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,140
When I pushed the door open,

259
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,100
Xu Shenxing just...

260
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,820
I never mentioned Xu Shenxing.

261
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,980
Who are you?

262
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,580
Stay here. I'll go take a look.

263
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,700
Stop!

264
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,540
Golden eagle.

265
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,100
Yes.

266
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,420
I've checked it.

267
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,820
According to the experienced bird keepers,

268
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,340
this eagle can sense danger

269
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,620
from a hundred miles away,

270
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,260
and make a screech.

271
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,780
Moreover, they also told me

272
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,540
that just a month and a half ago,

273
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,900
the butler of the Zhuang Residence

274
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,460
spent a large sum of money to buy one.

275
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,820
If you have something to say,
just say it.

276
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,100
I was just thinking

277
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,660
the killer hired by Zhuang Si said

278
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,980
that when he was about to make his move,

279
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,460
Xu Shenxing was already dead.

280
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,980
Then he was shot dead.

281
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,780
What was the motive of the person
who killed him?

282
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,740
There are only two possibilities.

283
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,420
First, he saw the real murderer.

284
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,980
Second, even if he didn't
see the murderer,

285
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,780
he knew some details about the case.

286
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,340
If we know such details,

287
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,860
we may identify the murderer.

288
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Anyway, I think

289
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,260
Zhuang Si is highly suspicious.

290
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,220
It's possible

291
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,860
that besides hiring this killer,

292
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,900
he also hired someone else.

293
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,940
I agree.

294
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,180
This feather appeared at the old house
in the southern suburbs.

295
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,420
It is quite strange.

296
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,860
We should check

297
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,580
the Zhuang Residence thoroughly.

298
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,820
Come on,

299
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,980
do you want to investigate
the Zhuang Residence at night?

300
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,180
(Zhuang Residence)

301
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,340
Captain Song,

302
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,820
what are you hesitating about?

303
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,820
I was thinking,

304
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,340
with such a large mansion,

305
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,220
how many guards will it have?

306
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,140
If we get discovered,

307
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,420
how do we escape?

308
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,220
Don't worry about that.

309
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,580
If we get discovered,

310
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,180
I'll distract the guards for you.

311
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,300
You just need to escape.

312
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,140
That won't do.

313
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,140
Police never abandon their comrades.

314
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,980
What's wrong?

315
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,380
I just remembered.

316
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,740
I lost track of the person who killed

317
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,140
at the gambling house entrance
right here.

318
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,300
So are you saying

319
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,700
the person is inside here?

320
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,580
It seems he was indeed sent
by Zhuang Si.

321
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,900
Then what are we waiting for?

322
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,500
Let's go.

323
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,460
Is this some new way
of cracking the case?

324
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,140
Where are the others?

325
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,620
I'm just brainstorming a bit.

326
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,800
Song He and Gu Sui

327
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,260
go to investigate
the Zhuang Residence.

328
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,180
Mao Shuai and Chen Zheng.

329
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,780
have other secret missions.

330
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,020
How's it going?

331
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,860
I still have many questions.

332
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Why did Shen Yuan and Huanyang

333
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,620
suddenly disappear?

334
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,980
Especially Shen Yuan.

335
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,900
What role is he playing?

336
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,660
I still have no clue.

337
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Don't worry.

338
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,900
I believe you will figure it out.

339
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,220
Nothing can stump our Detective Qin.

340
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,540
I'm not as omnipotent as you say.

341
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,540
Really?

342
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,020
But from the very beginning,

343
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,060
I thought so.

344
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,940
That's because from the very beginning

345
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,300
you have had preconceptions

346
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
and have overestimated me.

347
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,980
No.

348
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,020
At that time, I just thought

349
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,780
your theory was very innovative.

350
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,100
Huole?

351
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,420
Preconceptions.

352
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,260
Huole?

353
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:06,900
I got it.

354
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
It's because we had preconceptions
from the beginning

355
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,780
and went in the wrong direction.

356
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,200
I need to go check
Xu Shenxing's body again.

357
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,660
It really is a rare
and precious golden eagle.

358
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,620
It's truly different.

359
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,620
In this lifetime,

360
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
I feel content now.

361
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,300
You and I are old friends.

362
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,340
I won't hide it from you.

363
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,460
This is an insurance

364
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,020
for my opium business.

365
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,100
You know,

366
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
such a business

367
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,500
is a life-risking venture.

368
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,820
This golden eagle can sense danger

369
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,900
from a hundred miles away.

370
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,380
The annoying thing is,

371
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,220
once my ship of treasures

372
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,500
entered Jiangzhou,

373
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,860
it was thrown into the river

374
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,700
by Xu Shenxing.

375
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,700
Whenever I speak of this,

376
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,060
I feel hatred.

377
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,060
What is this?

378
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,860
What is this smell?

379
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,380
When Xu Shenxing was alive,

380
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,980
