=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 38=

2
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,600
Where is this place?

3
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Do you like it?

4
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,980
It's specially prepared for you.

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,350
If it weren't for someone

6
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,730
ruining my plans in the last two times,

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,100
you would have been here long ago.

8
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,600
But,

9
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,060
good things are worth the wait.

10
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,420
For the meat I should eat,

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,810
I will eat it sooner or later.

12
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,070
Well,

13
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,150
why are you laughing?

14
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,500
How much gambling debt have you owed?

15
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,450
We don't have any major grudges.

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,640
Why do you keep

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
coming after me?

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,090
In my world,

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,460
I have only one rule:

20
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,090
I always avenge my grudges.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,090
Come on.

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,180
I've told you before.

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,990
If you want revenge,

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,180
you should go for Song He.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,790
You went through all this trouble
to get me here

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,130
for other reasons, right?

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Stop pretending.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,460
You can't lie to me.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Go bring me the stuff.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,740
Get the money early

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,110
and stop this early.

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Bring what?

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,740
Paper and pen.

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,610
If I don't write something down,
what will you send to my dad?

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,250
But let me tell you this first.

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,950
My dad has been retired for many years.

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,790
He doesn't have much money.

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,090
If you ask for too much,

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,650
you might as well kill me now.

40
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
I'm telling you,

41
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,240
if I weren't

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
desperate now,

43
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,830
I wouldn't do such a shameful thing

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,900
even if I were to die.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,390
The principle of the Flying Wheel Gang?

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,230
My principle.

47
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,880
Don't mention the gang to me.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,810
I am at odds with them.

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
I only stole with them

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,670
twice

51
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,790
and both times I got caught by you.

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,090
That's so unlucky.

53
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,070
I'm done with them.

54
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,090
That's more like it.

55
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,080
See? Unintentionally,

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,550
I'm saving a misguided young man.

57
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,650
Stop talking nonsense with me.

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,210
You usually caught me stealing,

59
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,090
but now you're in my hands.

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,690
If you play any tricks,

61
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,110
I'll really stab you.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,020
Alright, give me the pen.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040
Why is it

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
in a foreign language?

65
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,250
If I don't write in a foreign language,

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,300
how will my dad know it's me?

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,740
I bet you wouldn't dare to play
any tricks.

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,740
Qin Huole?

69
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,160
This Qin Huole

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,880
seems to be the son
of Lawyer Qin Weilian.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,720
No way.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,200
I heard he's also the mind-reading detective

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,330
of the police station.

74
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,930
How did he end up being wanted?

75
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
Exactly.

76
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,340
(Notice No. 10 of Jiangzhou Police Station
Criminal Qin Huole)

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Stop!

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Turn around.

79
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,630
Sir.

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,930
Raise your hands above your head.

81
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,830
Sir.

82
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,840
Is this necessary?

83
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
Shut up.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,060
As long as you remain a thief,

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,810
I'll make sure you never have peace.

86
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,830
Why are you taking this down?

87
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,080
It says right here.

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,920
Bounty.

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
I thought if I had any clues,

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
I'd notify the detective squad
immediately.

91
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,150
What's this?

92
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
Foreign language.

93
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,030
I'm learning it.

94
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,870
You haven't even mastered Chinese.

95
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,360
Why would you want to learn a foreign language?

96
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,550
Come on, sir,

97
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,200
it isn't illegal to learn
a foreign language, is it?

98
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,390
No, it's not,

99
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,690
but it's disrespectful to your ancestors.

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
Take a good look

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,010
and remember this face.

102
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,670
You wander around every day.

103
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,510
If you happen to see him,

104
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,770
report to us immediately.

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Get lost.

106
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,930
You're done already?

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,420
Don't bring it up. You're in trouble.

108
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,390
I know.

109
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
Are you surprised?

110
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,230
That's not what I'm talking about.

111
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,620
(Notice No. 10 of Jiangzhou Police Station)

112
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,590
Well,

113
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,590
you're bold.

114
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,030
Did you really kill Master Long

115
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,870
and Master Du?

116
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,590
Hey man,

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,520
once I left Youlong Gambling House last night,

118
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,450
you brought me here.

119
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,060
Did I have time to go
to Master Du's house?

120
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,630
Exactly.

121
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,880
But now, your wanted notice

122
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,740
is all over Jiangzhou.

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
Just now, when I came back,

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,100
I even ran into a few police officers
looking for you.

125
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,880
Untie me.

126
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,110
You come with me to the police station.

127
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,100
You can prove my innocence.

128
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,420
Where? The police station?

129
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,430
Are you crazy? I'm not going there.

130
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,750
I can prove your innocence indeed,

131
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,890
but can I even get out?

132
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,540
Yes, you can.

133
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,250
Don't you need money?

134
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,300
Look, there's a bounty on this notice.

135
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,570
You take me to the police station.

136
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,790
Then you can openly

137
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,810
claim this bounty.

138
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,250
This way, you can pay off
your gambling debt.

139
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,240
Right?

140
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,390
It makes sense.

141
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,150
So now,

142
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,470
am I the only one

143
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,660
who can prove your innocence?

144
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,370
Alright, I get it.

145
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,080
Anyway, I need to pay you ransom money.

146
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,860
The rest will be a generous gift.

147
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,130
Come, I'll write you a note.

148
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,360
Cool.

149
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,660
(Qin Huole)

150
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,990
Hold it tight. If you lose it,
I won't admit it.

151
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,830
Don't worry.

152
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,280
Don't make a sound. It might be
the police.

153
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
I'll handle it.

154
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,450
If you get caught now,

155
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,670
I won't get the bounty

156
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,040
and they'll suspect I'm your accomplice.

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
That would be even worse.

158
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,060
(Qin Huole)

159
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,420
(Where exactly are you?)

160
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,300
(Why are you involved)

161
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,890
(in both cases?)

162
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,450
(This is so baffling.)

163
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,740
(What is the truth?)

164
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,830
(Who will be the killer's)

165
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,670
(next target?)

166
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,160
Among the three tigers of Jiangzhou,

167
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,130
now only the Great Master
of Huanyinglou is alive.

168
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,270
Sir.

169
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,140
Come in and have fun.

170
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,460
(Huanyinglou)
Take care.

171
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,450
See you next time.

172
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,510
Alright.

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,040
Long time no see.

174
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,880
Please come in.

175
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,930
Please come in, sir.

176
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,930
Please come in.

177
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,530
- Please come in.
- Welcome.

178
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,200
Juta has already taken people
to search for him.

179
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,230
We have 300 rickshaw pullers

180
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,720
in Jiangzhou.

181
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,290
I believe there will be news soon.

182
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,940
It's okay.

183
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,290
If the son runs away,

184
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,050
there's still the father.

185
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,580
The father pays off his son's debt.

186
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,820
(Great Master, Huanyinglou's owner)
It is only natural.

187
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,130
Great Master, rest assured.

188
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,370
I'll avenge my father

189
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,370
and Master Long's death no matter what.

190
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,170
Qin Huole

191
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,980
used some sinister methods

192
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,620
to kill Master Long and your father.

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,460
There must be

194
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,290
some secrets behind this.

195
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,750
Once you catch him,

196
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,870
bring him to me first.

197
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
Understood.

198
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,980
Great Master,

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
there is a troublemaker at Huanyinglou.

200
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,890
He has beaten up some girls

201
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,410
and even Madame Rong was beaten.

202
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,280
Why are you

203
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,410
telling me this?

204
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,980
Are those guards just freeloaders?

205
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,940
The troublemaker is a veteran.

206
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,650
None of them are his match.

207
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,050
If only Gu Sui were here.

208
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,250
They are

209
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,620
all useless.

210
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,520
Great Master.

211
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,070
Do you really need

212
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,130
to handle this personally?

213
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,340
I'm here.

214
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,400
I'll go meet him.

215
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Let's go.

216
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,070
Listen.

217
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,290
Keep a close watch here.

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,680
No one is allowed to approach.

219
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,650
Not even a fly.

220
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
Understood.

221
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,680
Young Master Jingtian.

222
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
You must stand up

223
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,800
for us.

224
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,870
Huanyinglou

225
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,290
is about to be torn apart.

226
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
Madame Rong.

227
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,340
You have gone through a lot.

228
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,530
Why are you shouting?

229
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,910
You don't know.

230
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,230
This is a tough one.

231
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,070
A tough one?

232
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,710
Go quickly.

233
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,280
Friend.

234
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,130
Where are you from?

235
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,650
It won't hurt to tell me your name.

236
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,890
Maybe we can be friends, right?

237
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,860
My surname is Ding.

238
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,220
You can

239
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,820
call me Ding Mao.

240
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Are you from Jiangzhou?

241
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,070
I'm just passing by.

242
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,700
If things go well,

243
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,250
I might stay here permanently.

244
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,130
Then I'll be straightforward.

245
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,580
Jiangzhou

246
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,390
is not a big city,

247
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,890
but it's not small either.

248
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,650
But as long as you mention
the three tigers of Jiangzhou,

249
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,130
no one would dare not show you some respect.

250
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
I know.

251
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,290
Great Master of Huanyinglou,

252
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,250
Master Long of Youlong Gambling House,

253
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,350
and

254
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,890
Master Du of Du's Rickshaw Company.

255
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,530
Master Du

256
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,050
is my father.

257
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,130
I wonder how they offended you.

258
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,030
How about giving me a favor

259
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,150
and letting it go?

260
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,200
I think

261
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,700
you're quite good at martial arts too.

262
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,740
You can finish your business first.

263
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,410
After it's done,

264
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,220
come and work for me.

265
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,890
Help me out.

266
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,820
Man, the wine...

267
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,740
It spills.

268
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,010
You are

269
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,170
Qin Huole, the wanted man.

270
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,400
That's right.

271
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,960
I can't believe you are hiding here.

272
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,860
Tell me, why did you kill my father?

273
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,960
I was also following orders.

274
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,800
From whom?

275
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,820
Your father's good friend.

276
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,640
You, you mean...

277
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,480
Yes.

278
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,860
It's Great Master.

279
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,620
He ordered me to kill your father
and Master Long,

280
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,740
so that he could dominate here alone.

281
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,050
No, impossible.

282
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,230
This is impossible.

283
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,590
This...

284
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,110
Now go.

285
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,410
Kill him

286
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,940
and avenge your father and Master Long.

287
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,100
Kill him.

288
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,170
Kill him.

289
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,840
He's coming out.

290
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
He's out.

291
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,410
Young Master Jingtian, how is it?

292
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,960
Young Master Jingtian, you...

293
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,800
Young Master Jingtian.

294
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,380
(Huanyinglou)
See you.

295
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,010
- Alright.
- Take care.

296
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,070
See you.

297
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,700
Here, sir.

298
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,340
Is Hongyan here?

299
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,270
She's waiting for you inside.

300
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,410
- Sir, come and have fun.
- Go up quickly.

301
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,170
Any new girls recently?

302
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,440
Yes, I'll introduce them to you.

303
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,050
Alright, let me introduce them to you.

304
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,400
- Sorry.
- Come in and have fun.

305
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,670
Everyone, come in and have fun.

306
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,700
- Please come in.
- Welcome.

307
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,100
Sir, please come inside.

308
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm Song He from the detective squad.

309
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,750
I'm looking for Du Jingtian.

310
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,680
He is not here.

311
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,710
Then I'll see Great Master.

312
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,680
My boss said

313
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,750
no one is allowed to approach.

314
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,980
They said no visitors.

315
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,340
It's not peaceful today.

316
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,070
Jingtian.

317
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Go and check

318
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,870
what's going on.

319
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,440
Kid.

320
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,410
I watched you grow up.

321
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,170
You killed my father.

322
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,250
You killed my father.

323
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,340
