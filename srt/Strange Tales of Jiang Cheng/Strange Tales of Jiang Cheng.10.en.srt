=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 10=

2
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,990
Today, the feud between Qin Weilian and me

3
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,160
must be settled,

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,960
or I will burn this place down,

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,040
and we will die together.

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,080
No. Don't.

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,160
Let's settle it.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Alright.

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm here. Come on.

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,200
How do you want to settle it?

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,360
I won't resist.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
Lawyer Qin.

13
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,310
Captain Song.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
This is between

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,280
Miss Jiangyun and me.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
Please don't get involved.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,410
You're a good girl.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,560
I know we've come down to this

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,970
for many reasons.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,590
And I also know

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,200
you will release Huole and Xiaofan,
right?

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,410
Shut up!

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,080
Qin Weilian.

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,360
I want you to watch

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,920
your son die in front of you.

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,960
No!

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,610
Director Xu, quickly find someone

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,490
to save them.

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,710
Someone!

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
Song He.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,800
We're here!

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
Dad, we're here!

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,950
Over there!

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,730
- We're fine.
- We're fine.

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Oh no.

36
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,200
Will we die here today?

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
No, we won't.

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,520
There must be a way out.

39
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,110
Let me think about it.

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,550
There must be a way out.

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,150
Let me think about it.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
In detective novels,

43
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,170
most secret rooms are set underground.

44
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,920
Trying to trap people in an attic,

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,640
isn't that nonsense?

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,730
Miss Jiangyun.

47
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,080
My life

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
is too bitter.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,040
Take her away.

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,260
(One month later)

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,820
(Where should one dwell?
How should one subdue the mind?)

52
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,450
The judicial trial is unchangeable.

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,730
Murder is an unforgivable felony.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
But all of them

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,520
have received the punishment
they deserve.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,490
Maybe this will give you some comfort.

57
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,870
Can you

58
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,400
believe him now?

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,760
No.

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
You don't dare to believe?

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,200
You don't understand.

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Actually,

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,450
you really liked him, didn't you?

64
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,320
That's why when you were betrayed,

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
you were so angry.

66
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,290
I have something to give you.

67
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,340
(Property Deed)

68
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,170
The property deed of my house?

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
I found it in my dad's study room.

70
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,850
I checked his bank transactions.

71
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,990
Five years ago,

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
my dad withdrew

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,090
60 silver dollars.

74
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,550
And that day,

75
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,170
your house was sold.

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
But the broker

77
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,530
didn't mention who bought the house.

78
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,880
That was a haunted house.

79
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,650
Four people died there in one day.

80
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,880
Except for my dad,

81
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
who would be foolish enough to buy it?

82
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,830
If I had those 60 silver dollars,

83
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,000
I could live more comfortably

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,320
in the United Kingdom.

85
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,980
(Property Deed)

86
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
What is this?

87
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,960
This is written by the buyer.

88
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,050
Who knows what it is?

89
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,440
Though I've learned all the laws,

90
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,680
I still feel it's like a dream and an illusion.

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,530
Why did he...

92
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,170
You should ask him about that

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
if

94
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,760
you can meet him again.

95
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
Miss Jiangyun.

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,850
Hatred cannot punish others.

97
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,290
It only brings pain and destruction.

98
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,320
Live for yourself.

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,480
The former prisoner held in this cell

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,360
was Lawyer Qin.

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,800
I asked Captain Chen

102
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,360
to lock you in this prison cell.

103
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,530
Because I thought

104
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
maybe in this way,

105
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,490
you could be closer to each other.

106
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,860
(Though I've learned...)

107
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,560
Where should one dwell?

108
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,440
How should one subdue the mind?

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Though I've learned all the laws,

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,290
I still feel it's like a dream and an illusion.

111
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,320
So, what are your plans next?

112
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,650
Well, about that,

113
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,760
I should ask you instead.

114
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,850
The court sentenced me

115
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,800
to do volunteer work

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,410
here for a year.

117
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,760
Three hours a day.

118
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,210
Actually, it's good.

119
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,760
I can help the prisoners here.

120
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,320
It's better than staying idle

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
at home.

122
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,160
Are you really planning

123
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,050
to quit lawyering?

124
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,070
No.

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,730
But I can't do it in Jiangzhou.

126
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,510
By the way,

127
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,920
you haven't answered my question yet.

128
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
My plan?

129
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,650
I want to stay here with you.

130
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,730
With me?

131
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,050
Don't I know you well enough?

132
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,440
Ever since you solved

133
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,870
that bomb case,

134
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,190
your mind

135
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,830
has been entirely
on the detective squad.

136
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,670
Isn't that right?

137
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,490
A father knows his son best.

138
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,510
Well then,

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,920
I won't interfere

140
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,510
with your investigations,

141
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,210
but don't cause any trouble,

142
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,450
and make sure to stay safe.

143
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,030
Got it, Dad.

144
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,190
Thank you for your understanding.

145
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,150
Alright, go back now.

146
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,470
Stop lingering around here.

147
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,870
Okay.

148
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,320
Bye, Dad.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,330
How is Lawyer Qin doing?

150
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,090
He's doing great, full of energy.

151
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,910
Next,

152
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,640
we should go find Song He.

153
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,510
Why do we need to find him?

154
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,990
Are you planning to...

155
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,110
Yes,

156
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
I can't wait.

157
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,060
(Walking for the Innocent)

158
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,280
Captain, this plaque is a gift
from the people of Jiangzhou.

159
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,590
Captain, you said you would
keep this plaque

160
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,680
for your future son.

161
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Shut up.

162
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,990
I'm a man

163
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
of my word.

164
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,910
Captain Song,

165
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,610
if you can't bear to chop it,
just say so.

166
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,430
You've been hesitating for so long.

167
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,790
Are you going to chop it or not?

168
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,240
If not, we're leaving.

169
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,450
Our butts are sore from sitting.

170
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,750
You...

171
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,990
Alright, alright.

172
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,570
Mr. Qin is just joking with you.

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Have you had enough fun?

174
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,790
Forget it.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,490
The people worked so hard on this,

176
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,950
and the calligraphy is so elegant.

177
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,690
It would be a pity to chop it.

178
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
How about this?

179
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,880
You two take it back

180
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,110
and hang it in my office.

181
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
What did he say?

182
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,690
His office?

183
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,260
(Walking for the Innocent)

184
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,400
Mao Shuai, lift your side a bit higher.

185
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Okay.

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Detective Qin,

187
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,730
your coffee is the best.

188
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,040
Oh my,

189
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,520
I really love it

190
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,640
when you call me Detective Qin.

191
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Xiaofan, say it a few more times.

192
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,930
Detective Qin.

193
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Detective Qin.

194
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
Stop it!

195
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,680
Can someone explain it to me?

196
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,760
What's going on here?

197
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,600
Why did Director Xu give special approval

198
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,930
for Qin Huole to join our police station

199
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,450
and even set up

200
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,120
a separate
psychological analysis department?

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,960
And he doesn't report to me.

202
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,030
Through psychological analysis,

203
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,070
Mr. Qin solved the bomb case

204
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,970
and the human clock case.

205
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,760
Now everyone in the office

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,850
is very interested
in his case-solving methods.

207
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,930
I think it's great.

208
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,240
Our station

209
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,790
should embrace such new technologies,

210
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,630
shouldn't we?

211
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,030
Tell me,

212
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,460
what kind of tricks did you use?

213
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,360
Didn't Commander Lei say
he wanted to repay me?

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,850
I didn't accept it,

215
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,110
but

216
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,250
I asked him for another favor.

217
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,190
(Special approval for Qin Huole
to join the police station.)

218
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,030
Join the police station.

219
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,240
Who told you to put this here?

220
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,680
Move it over.

221
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,090
Are you not listening to me anymore?

222
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,150
This is an order!

223
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
Yes, sir.

224
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,110
Wait.

225
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,250
Are you trying to get away with it like this?

226
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,360
I don't agree.

227
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,040
It's easy to handle this.

228
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,760
Put it in my place first.

229
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,360
I'll keep it for you.

230
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,550
A year from today,

231
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,600
we'll evaluate

232
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,520
your achievements,

233
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,790
and then we'll know

234
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,840
where to put it.

235
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
How about that?

236
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,600
Deal.

237
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,510
Deal.

238
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,080
Captain Song.

239
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,790
I joined the police station

240
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,850
to become a good police officer
who seeks the truth.

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
In this regard,

242
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,190
I believe our goals

243
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,030
are the same.

244
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,850
Welcome to the police force.

245
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,850
We'll see who prevails in the future.

246
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,500
(Dexian Teahouse)

247
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,790
Dad.

248
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,390
Why are you here?

249
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,790
Just passing by after work.

250
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,630
By the way,

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,360
who were you chatting with just now?

252
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,690
Mr. Che Jingwen
from Sicun Middle School.

253
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Is he your friend?

254
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,430
Mr. Che doesn't make friends.

255
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,360
He came to see me

256
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,930
specifically for Jushangfang.

257
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,090
He thinks Jushangfang is a good place

258
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,930
and shouldn't just disappear.

259
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,400
We should find a capable person

260
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,810
to reopen it.

261
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,210
Mr. Che makes a good point.

262
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,910
But

263
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,360
where can we find

264
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
another Su Jiangyun in your heart?

265
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,850
- You...
- Just kidding, Dad.

266
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
Just kidding.

267
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,000
Slick.

268
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,590
Was there nothing else

269
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,720
Mr. Che wanted to discuss with you?

270
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,270
He...

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,880
You kid.

272
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,490
You speak more and more like a police officer.

273
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,190
Are you questioning me like a criminal?

274
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,930
No, I'm just curious.

275
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,120
Let's go home.

276
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,680
Walk properly.

277
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,690
Don't put your arm around my shoulders.

278
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,760
(Could it be some treasure?)

279
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,870
Help!

280
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,970
Help!

281
