=Episode 24=

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,890
I'm

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,220
sorry.

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,850
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,890
I'm sorry, Wu Bing.

6
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,130
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,540
(Mend Your Ways)

8
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,130
Song He!

9
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,550
Where is he?

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,270
Doctor Fan, stop shouting.

11
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,110
They all went out.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Went out? When? Where did they go?

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,170
About 15 minutes ago.

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,250
Just after they released Wu Bing.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,480
They released Wu Bing?

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,080
That sinful man deserves to be shot.

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,130
But he wouldn't confess.

18
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,550
Now the kid is gone too.

19
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,250
There's no evidence to accuse him.

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,730
I've never seen

21
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,170
Captain so angry.

22
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,410
Sweetie, is it tasty?

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,640
If you like it, I will buy you more.

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,730
It's tasty.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,170
- Thank you, Father.
- Look how you spoil your daughter.

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,940
It's me!

27
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,290
Why are you following me?

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,450
I know why you deliberately let him go.

29
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,240
Have you considered
the consequences of doing this?

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,760
Have you considered
the consequences of letting him go?

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,660
I let him go.

32
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,400
When he commits another crime,

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,480
I'll catch him again, right?

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,560
This is lynching. We can't do that.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
You understand this better than I do.

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Then what's your idea?

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,040
Justice

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,170
is to protect the safety of the people.

39
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,130
If we can't achieve this,

40
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,060
no injustice in the world
would be an empty promise.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
We will

42
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,700
bring Wu Bing to justice.

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,140
But we can't do it this way
to show justice.

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Trust me.

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,700
You are the police.

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
If you shoot,

47
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,340
how are you different
from someone like me?

48
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,660
Haven't you heard?

49
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,050
If I don't do it, who will?

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,730
Where is Qin Huole?

51
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,190
Oh no.

52
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,140
You scared me to death.

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
Don't worry.

54
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,360
I know what I'm doing.

55
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,390
Can I leave now?

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,230
Sir.

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,760
If you fool with a good citizen like me

58
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,970
in this way again,

59
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,160
I will go to the police station

60
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,450
to demand an explanation.

61
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,520
How can a murderer

62
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,780
be a good citizen?

63
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,100
Murderer?

64
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,630
Where is he?

65
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,790
Are you talking about the detective

66
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,020
who almost shot me just now?

67
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,580
Niannian is not dead.

68
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,870
Really?

69
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,990
Impossible.

70
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,670
Niannian has been sent to Anping Hospital.

71
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,000
She just inhaled a lot of smoke,

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,970
which caused her to pass out.

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,340
She's fine now.

74
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,290
What exactly happened?

75
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,170
Song He asked me to inform the fire brigade.

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,900
When I ran out of the Temple of Guan Yu...

77
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,200
Xiaofan.

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,320
I found a really interesting place.

79
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,260
I'll take you there.

80
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,900
Let me tell you,

81
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,700
this temple was haunted before.

82
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
I was so curious,
so I came to check it out.

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,220
I found a secret passage

84
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,290
that leads to a hidden chamber below.

85
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,930
Then I better not go.

86
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,440
Don't worry. Just follow me closely.

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,280
You'll be fine.

88
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,550
Alright.

89
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,780
Yinyin.

90
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,610
Niannian, Niannian!

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Niannian.

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,270
It was an emergency.

93
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,490
So I sent her to the hospital first.

94
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,340
Fortunately, she is stable now.

95
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,910
After I notified Uncle He,

96
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,930
I came to find you immediately.

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,190
That's great.

98
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,490
It's good that Niannian is okay.

99
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
Stop right there!

100
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,610
Listen to me carefully.

101
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,390
Whether you are Wu Jia,

102
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,460
Wu Yi, or Wu Bing,

103
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,340
you cannot escape the law's punishment.

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
Niannian.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,840
Niannian.

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
Don't be afraid.

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,780
Father and Mother are here.

108
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
Don't be afraid.

109
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,700
- Niannian.
- Mother.

110
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,490
- Father.
- Niannian.

111
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
Captain.

112
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,900
Don't worry, leave it to us.

113
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,450
We will take care of him.

114
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,270
Wu Bing.

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,410
I won

116
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,750
our bet.

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,240
- Go.
- Go.

118
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,090
It's great to bring Wu Bing

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
to justice.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,290
Actually, we should thank Xiaofan the most.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
Without her,

122
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,930
Niannian wouldn't have come back alive.

123
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,690
I feel that somehow,

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,140
Yinyin was helping us.

125
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,450
Captain Song, thank you so much

126
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,380
for bringing Niannian back to us safely.

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes.

128
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,780
We will remember your great kindness

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,780
for the rest of our lives.

130
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,550
Please don't say that.

131
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,540
This is what we should do.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,540
Besides, it was actually Xiaofan
who saved Niannian.

133
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,140
She's good at flying a kite.

134
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,140
Do you know why a kite flies?

135
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,020
Because it wants to go far away.

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,620
Is this also from Yinyin?

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Yes.

138
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,570
She was a very lovely little girl,

139
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,290
full of whimsical ideas.

140
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,810
Do you know

141
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,450
what I want to tell you now?

142
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,740
I can't read minds.

143
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,380
How would I know?

144
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,980
Xiaofan,

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,140
we shouldn't keep blaming ourselves

146
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,220
for what happened in the past.

147
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,860
Rather, we need to focus on the current

148
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,860
and the future.

149
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,900
Captain Song,

150
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,660
do you also have something to tell me?

151
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,580
In the future,

152
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,900
we will work together

153
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,340
to overcome difficulties

154
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,300
and find the truth.

155
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,540
Xiaofan, my kite.

156
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,820
It has gone further away.

157
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,340
It's free now.

158
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,180
Yinyin.

159
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,100
Yinyin.

160
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,580
You're back.

161
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,420
Xiaofan,

162
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,660
I'm here to say goodbye.

163
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,100
Don't go.

164
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,420
I shouldn't have left you alone.

167
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,340
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,340
If you feel guilty

169
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,340
and want to do something,

170
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,500
then try to help

171
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,900
other people in need.

172
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,900
Try your best to help them.

173
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,860
Sir, take care.

174
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
Do come again, sir.

175
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,580
Mr. Zhao, it's been a long time.

176
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,460
This way, please.

177
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,020
Mr. Xu has arrived.

178
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,660
- Hello, Mr. Xu.
- Hello, Mr. Xu.

179
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
Mr. Xu.

180
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,780
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Xu.

181
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,460
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Xu.

182
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,460
(Xu Shenxing)

183
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,780
A silver dollar.

184
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,860
Thank you, Mr. Xu, for your generosity.

185
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,140
(Huanyinglou)

186
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,500
It's been a long time.

187
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,740
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Xu.

188
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,340
I've been waiting eagerly

189
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,380
for you to come.

190
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,580
It's been a long time
since you came last time.

191
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,500
My girls

192
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,340
have all been missing you dearly.

193
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,060
(Madam Rong of Huanyinglou)
We thought

194
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,780
you were upset with Huanyinglou.

195
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,340
Is the room I requested ready?

196
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,280
Don't worry.

197
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,820
It's been ready for you.

198
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,300
I'll have Yinshuang take you there.

199
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,540
As usual,

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,420
all the girls in the house

201
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,660
will receive a reward tonight.

202
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,900
Mr. Xu.

203
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,700
The food and drinks are ready.

204
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,620
Thank you, Mr. Xu, for your generosity.

205
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,740
Thank you, Mr. Xu, for your generosity.

206
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,300
Mr. Xu.

207
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Let's drink.

208
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,180
Mr. Xu.

209
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,060
Have you missed me lately?

210
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,980
Yes, I have.

211
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,260
(Yinshuang, singing girl of Huanyinglou)
Yes.

212
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,740
I wanted to ask you

213
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,860
how she is doing.

214
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,340
I thought

215
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,900
you were missing me.

216
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,900
As for her,

217
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,980
there's been no news for a long time.

218
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,860
Please come inside, sir.

219
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,660
Take care, sir.

220
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,980
Cheers.

221
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Welcome back.

222
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,420
I will definitely come back.

223
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,220
(Huanyinglou)

224
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,660
Let's go in separately.

225
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,740
I'll go in first.

226
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,200
Don't draw too much attention.

227
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,500
When it's time to act,
I'll give you a signal.

228
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Do you see that person?

229
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,380
You need to be careful with him.

230
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,660
He is Gu Sui, a guard of Huanyinglou.

231
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,020
He may be young,

232
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
but he's a veteran

233
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,420
and a tough man.

234
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,340
Mr. Xu.

235
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,660
If you are missing Huanyang,

236
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,020
I can help you

237
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,420
find out some news.

238
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,580
Forget it.

239
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,740
I have let Huanyang down.

240
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,980
Sir, what amusing things
were you talking about?

241
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,620
You were not even listening to my song.

242
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,460
We were talking about...

243
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,140
Mr. Zhuang.

244
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,180
(Zhuang Si, general manager
of Zhuang's Trading Company)

245
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,940
Let's go.

246
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,620
Take care, sir.

247
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Welcome.

248
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,340
Please come inside.

249
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,380
Welcome.

250
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,940
Take care.

251
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,980
(Gu Sui, a guard of Huanyinglou)

252
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,940
Hurry up.

253
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,140
Shenxing.

254
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,100
How long have we been business partners?

255
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,460
Three or four years, right?

256
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,060
Three years and eight months.

257
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,180
And before we started doing business,

258
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,740
how long had we known each other?

259
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
The two of us

260
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,740
were childhood playmates.

261
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,100
What do you think?

262
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,140
You still remember it.

263
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,220
But what have you done to your best friend?

264
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,000
