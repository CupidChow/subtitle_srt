=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 41=

2
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,840
A few days ago, did you go

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,710
to Youlong Gambling House

4
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,550
to find Master Long?

5
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,850
Why? Huole is not the murderer?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,210
As a woman,

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,540
if I didn't have some skills
in reading people,

8
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,950
how could I manage Jushangfang

9
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,780
where the noted figures gather?

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,950
If Qin Huole

11
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,040
were the murderer,

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,040
why would you come to me

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,370
to ask about Master Long?

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
What?

15
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,540
Did my father really want to recruit them?

16
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,640
You know what kind of people they are,

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
don't you?

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
They are just a bunch

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,180
of thugs and hooligans.

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,560
With them in the Lei's Army,

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
doesn't my father worry about his reputation?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Miss,

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,370
the Commander is well aware of this,

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,590
but once the war starts,

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,000
he urgently needs more manpower.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,710
You're knowledgeable so you must
have heard

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,760
that one general's success is built
on the bones of thousands.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,400
Sacrificing them

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,670
is better than sacrificing those
who have followed the Commander

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,960
through life and death for many years.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,740
So my father

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,460
wanted Master Long's people

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,020
to die for the Lei's Army.

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,830
Miss,

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,410
I know you are kind-hearted,

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,830
but in war,

37
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,370
someone always has to be the vanguard.

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
What did you just say?

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,810
"Once the war starts"?

40
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,370
Is My father going to war again?

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,160
I need to ask him.

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,990
Youlong Gambling House

43
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,780
is located in a prime spot.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Particularly, it's close to Qianjiang River.

45
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,300
The view is great.

46
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,740
It's a pity

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,810
not to open a restaurant

48
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,210
in such a good location.

49
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,950
So I want to use that place

50
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,900
to open a branch.

51
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,500
Did you go to discuss with Master Long

52
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,500
to let him give up the house to you?

53
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,350
What?

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,970
Do you think I'm bold

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,690
to dare ask Master Long for a place?

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,990
Actually, in business,

57
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,810
transactions bring money.

58
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,690
Master Long knew it better than I do.

59
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,410
As long as I can offer enough money,

60
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,930
even if he refuses,

61
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,180
he won't be angry.

62
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,830
Besides,

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,210
I am determined to open this branch.

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,530
Even if I can't take over
Youlong Gambling House,

65
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,690
I will acquire other shops.

66
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,740
Who else knew about this?

67
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,830
Those shops

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
in the north of the city

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,740
- all knew it.
- Which shops?

70
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,860
Hengyitai Teahouse,

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,950
Taicang Rice Shop,

72
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,210
Dasixi Silk Shop,

73
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,370
and Heyoutang Pharmacy.

74
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,740
Father, are you going to war again?

75
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,130
Who told you that?

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Be honest.

77
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,350
Yes.

78
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,580
Why?

79
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,790
Didn't you promise

80
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,760
to govern Jiangzhou well

81
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,810
and not go to war anymore?

82
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,340
Why are you breaking your word?

83
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,510
When my mother died,

84
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,650
what did you promise me?

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,020
Sweetie,

86
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,780
I am the most reasonable person.

87
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,760
Originally, I wanted to settle down

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,160
and be the governor of Jiangzhou.

89
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,690
But they won't let me.

90
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,990
They want to destroy me.

91
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,550
If I don't want to be destroyed,
what can I do?

92
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,740
I have to resist.

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
Sweetie.

94
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,390
Sweetie,

95
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,210
listen to me.

96
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,950
Chen Biao

97
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,230
has led his troops

98
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,630
to the outskirts of Ningcheng.

99
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,550
They are ready to move.

100
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,370
They might attack Jiangzhou any day now.

101
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,660
I just got the intelligence.

102
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,740
What do you want me to do?

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,890
But once the war starts,

104
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,860
there will be no mercy
on the battlefield.

105
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,230
I've already

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,300
lost my mother to war.

107
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,010
I don't want to lose you too.

108
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,620
Didn't you always say

109
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,620
that I'm a great hero

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,330
and that I'm invincible?

111
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,510
It's okay.

112
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,080
But once you step

113
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,570
into this mess,

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,890
you can't get out.

115
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,370
I have already

116
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,250
stepped into the mess.

117
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,660
I have to.

118
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,780
(Relationship Diagram
of related figures)

119
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,360
Huole.

120
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,470
What did you find?

121
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,540
I have already figured it out

122
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,190
why Zou Jing went
to Youlong Gambling House.

123
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,450
My father sent him.

124
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,250
To recruit Master Long, Juta and their gang.

125
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,250
What did you get from Jushangfang?

126
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,450
Nothing special at the moment.

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,880
We still need more investigation.

128
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,010
Captain, we have figured out
the murderer's situation.

129
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,080
- Speak up.
- Those shoes are specially designed

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,270
for prisoners by Jiangzhou Prison.

131
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,860
They are afraid that prisoners may use

132
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,990
the shoelaces from regular shoes

133
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,680
to commit suicide.

134
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,420
The murderer is an escaped prisoner?

135
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,220
No, he was released
after serving his sentence.

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
His name is Ding Mao.

137
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,550
I retrieved all his files

138
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,390
from the prison.

139
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,510
By the way,

140
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,770
you guys go to these places

141
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,690
to check if Qingyao,
the boss of Jushangfang,

142
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,500
has discussed any shop transfer issues
with them.

143
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,280
Make sure to clarify the exact time.

144
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,420
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,740
Come on, let's sort out
the known information.

146
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,600
(Abao was hypnotized.
Du Jingtian was hypnotized.)

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,060
Ding Mao, 28 years old,

148
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,690
from Nanxiawa of Jiangzhou.

149
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,920
He lost his father at an early age

150
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,250
and was imprisoned six years ago.

151
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,070
The reason

152
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,000
was that he couldn't bear to see
his mother being humiliated.

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,230
- Miss, have fun with me.
- See you next time.

154
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,840
Sir,

155
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,680
did you get hurt?

156
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,690
Be careful.

157
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,130
Get away.

158
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,510
Get away.

159
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,930
How dare you make me fall?

160
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,250
You have to compensate me.

161
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,060
I'll beat you to death.

162
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,150
I'll kill you.

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,750
That rich young man pulled a few strings

164
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,540
and got Ding Mao a six-year imprisonment.

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,920
During his imprisonment,

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,860
he showed no bad behavior.

167
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,180
On the fifth of this month,

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
he was released.

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,990
It was the day before the murder

170
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,890
at Youlong Gambling House.

171
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,330
He is a filial son.

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,190
But why did he want to kill someone

173
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,750
right after being released from prison?

174
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,630
He and the victims

175
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,540
didn't know each other at all.

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,690
Perhaps he was hired by someone.

177
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,100
Then why did this person

178
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,370
hire a contract killer

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,680
and what is their motive?

180
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,030
Collapse.

181
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,830
Collapse?

182
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,710
A contract killing is

183
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,620
to ensure the target is killed.

184
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,590
However, in this case,

185
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,060
the focus is on the killing method.

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
This murderer

187
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,810
used hypnosis

188
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,930
to entice the victim's close relative

189
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
to kill the victim.

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,300
When the three tigers of Jiangzhou have died,

191
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,570
the gangs are leaderless,

192
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,100
which will inevitably cause chaos.

193
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,890
In such turbulent waters, they can fish
for benefits.

194
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,690
And they can move to their next steps.

195
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Therefore,

196
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,280
this is

197
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,440
the employer's true intention.

198
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,370
Jushangfang's manager

199
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,470
Qingyao

200
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,010
wanted to take over
Youlong Gambling House

201
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,690
and open a branch of Jushangfang,

202
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,980
but was rejected by Master Long.

203
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,420
She has a motive for committing
the crime.

204
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,130
Zou Jing

205
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,550
was ordered by Commander Lei

206
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,860
to recruit Master Long's team,

207
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,130
but was also rejected by Master Long.

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,660
However, if Master Long died,

209
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,660
it might have been different.

210
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,810
To find a breakthrough,

211
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,300
we must start with Ding Mao.

212
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,420
(Mrs. Ding)

213
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,770
Tomorrow is his mother's birthday.

214
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,940
(Nanxiawa Map)
Nanxiawa

215
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,410
is an early settlement of refugees.

216
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,750
It's lack of planning,

217
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,990
so the terrain is very complex.

218
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,890
Ding Mao's home is located
in the central area.

219
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,290
The surrounding alleys are crisscrossed,

220
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,620
making it hard to deploy our men there.

221
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,740
This case involves the three tigers
of Jiangzhou.

222
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,050
They had many minions.

223
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,460
The city must not fall into chaos.

224
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
If it does,

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,940
the people will suffer.

226
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,200
We must catch the murderer,

227
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,130
and the sooner, the better.

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,620
Therefore, I request you

229
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,980
to give me strong support.

230
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,600
When is Ding Mao's mother's birthday?

231
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,440
Tomorrow.

232
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,820
So from tonight,

233
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,100
Ding Mao is very likely to appear.

234
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,380
Alright,

235
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,720
I will put all available personnel

236
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,030
in the police station

237
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,890
under your command.

238
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,110
If that's still not enough,

239
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,320
I can also

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,410
join the battle.

241
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
Thank you, Director.

242
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,150
With your support,

243
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,700
I will definitely capture Ding Mao.

244
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Wait a moment.

245
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
Song He.

246
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,290
Are you so sure

247
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,100
that Ding Mao will appear?

248
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,940
He is not an ordinary criminal.

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,250
Ding Mao is a filial son.

250
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,750
Back then,

251
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,510
he went to prison

252
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,450
for protecting his mother.

253
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,350
For so many years,

254
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,100
he hasn't seen his mother even once.

255
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,070
So Huole believed

256
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,770
that he would definitely make this trip.

257
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,290
I trust his deduction.

258
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,500
I told you this morning

259
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,040
Qin Huole

260
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,410
is in a special situation now.

261
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Understood.

262
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,590
Qin Huole

263
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,890
will stay at the police office.

264
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,890
- Go and get ready.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,990
- Hello?
- Master,

266
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,150
Young Master is hospitalized.

267
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,770
What? Is he alright?

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
(Be quiet. Nurse Station.)
He hasn't woken up yet.

269
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,520
The doctor said

270
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,080
he drank too much.

271
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,030
If it goes on like this,

272
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,250
he will ruin his health sooner or later.

273
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,740
Master, you need to think
of a solution quickly.

274
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,500
We can't let Young Master continue
like this.

275
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,710
Now, Young Master

276
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,580
gets himself drunk every day

277
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,130
He always mutters Huanyang's name.

278
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,500
This useless fool.

279
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,040
Tell him

280
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,250
to stay in the hospital obediently.

281
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,150
Without my permission,
he is not allowed to be discharged.

282
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,470
- Understood.
- Did you hear that?

283
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,520
Yes, Master.

284
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

285
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
(Ward Six)

286
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:49,020
(Changing Room)

287
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,950
Doctor.

288
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,040
Doctor.

289
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,220
Please take a look at him quickly.

290
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,130
How is he doing?

291
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
Don't worry.

292
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
Let me check.

293
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,220
Huanyang.

294
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,070
Who is Huanyang?

295
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,580
Don't even mention it.

296
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,150
She was

297
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,080
our Young Master's fiancée.

298
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
But she was killed in an accident.

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,820
Our Young Master

300
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,340
has never forgotten her.

301
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,250
He drank too much.

302
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,350
He needs to throw up immediately.

303
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,580
You go buy some porridge.

304
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,050
I'll give him an emetic.

305
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,150
After he's thrown up,

306
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,620
some porridge will be good for him.

307
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
What are you waiting for?

308
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,990
Hurry up and go.

309
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,500
Xu Shenxing,

310
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,770
wake up.

311
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,940
Do you want to know who killed Huanyang?

312
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,820
Xu Shenxing.

313
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,650
Xu Shenxing.

314
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,410
Open your eyes.

315
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,860
Look who I am.

316
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,990
Shenxing.

317
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,750
Huanyang.

318
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,530
Xu Shenxing.

319
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,250
Xu Shenxing.

320
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,520
Who are you?

321
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,370
I am here to help you.

322
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,400
Let's go.

323
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,920
Where to?

324
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
Isn't it the Director's order?

325
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,430
We put down our work

326
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,700
and support the arrest at your command.

327
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,920
Except you.

328
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,650
Why?

329
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,890
Because you are a doctor,
not a police officer.

330
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,990
Besides,

331
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,620
Ding Mao's martial arts
are not inferior to mine.

332
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,890
It would be dangerous for you to go.

333
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,320
- But, you...
- Xiaofan.

334
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,750
Listen to Song He.

335
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,960
We will stay in the office.

336
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,980
There are other tasks to do.

337
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,830
Really?

338
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,220
Really.

339
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,750
After I leave, Huole will tell you.

340
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,770
Be careful.

341
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,900
What task?

342
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,700
(General Office)

343
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,780
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

344
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
Any movement?

345
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,800
The old lady has been using jute twine

346
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,290
to make shoe soles since noon.

347
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,860
She hasn't stopped yet.

348
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Tell Chen Zheng

349
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,400
to keep a close watch.

350
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,690
- Don't be careless.
- Yes, sir.

351
