=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 36=

2
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,540
(Illusion maze. It's easy to forget
night but to remember daytime.)

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
(No way.)

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,100
(I must figure out)

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,220
(what exactly this tattoo represents.)

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,980
(Xingyuan Hotel)

7
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,060
(Youlong Gambling House)

8
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,420
(Youlong Gambling House)

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,040
Master Long.

10
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,430
Thank you.

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,970
Youlan.

12
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,900
Be nice.

13
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,740
(Youlan, from Youlong Gambling House)

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Hello, Master Long.

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,900
(Master Long, owner of Youlong Gambling House)

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,220
You are

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,010
Qin Weilian's son who studied abroad?

18
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,500
Yes, my name is Qin Huole

19
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,600
Please sit.

20
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,430
Master Long.

21
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,060
It's a Western gadget.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,410
What's the matter? Speak up.

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,220
Nothing.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,730
I just got back.

25
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,620
But I've heard people say,

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,680
in Jiangzhou

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
we can't mess with

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,220
the three tigers of Jiangzhou the most.

29
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,080
They're Great Master,

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,970
the owner of Huanyinglou,

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,000
Master Du,

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,340
the head of Du's Rickshaw Company,

33
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,590
and the one who ranks second in line.

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,410
That's you, Master Long,

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,990
the boss of Youlong Gambling House.

36
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
They say

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
in Jiangzhou,

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
there's nothing

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,100
that can escape your notice.

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,730
If a silver needle is lost at midnight,

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,990
you'll know whom it belongs to

42
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,450
by early morning the next day.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,540
I've also heard

44
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,710
that you

45
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,970
are the most warm-hearted man.

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,110
You love

47
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,780
helping people so much,

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,920
just like the Timely Rain Song Jiang

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,250
of Liangshan outlaws.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
In The Outlaws of the Marsh,

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,250
I hate Song Jiang the most.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,540
Save

53
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,780
the flattery.

54
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,660
What's the matter? Just speak up.

55
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,670
Well.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,620
Since you said so,

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,990
I'll get straight to the point.

58
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,370
Master Long, have you seen this before?

59
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,100
Why are you asking about this?

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,610
This tattoo

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,170
is related to a murder case.

62
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,900
I must get to the bottom of it.

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,810
Detective Qin, right?

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Yes.

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,100
Let me give you some advice.

66
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,170
You've already shown yourself off.

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,660
Now it's time to stop.

68
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,260
Even if you want to die early,

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,340
I don't

70
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,220
want to die with you.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Master Long, don't!

72
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,510
Master Long.

73
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
Remember,

74
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,370
from now on, if anyone asks about it,

75
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,140
you must insist

76
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,460
that we didn't meet

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,490
tonight.

78
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,260
Why are you in a daze?

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,050
How's it going?

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,490
It's a close throatcut with one slash.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,830
Judging from the wound,

82
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,140
the killer should be left-handed.

83
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,000
There is no fighting in the room.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,100
Master Long was a veteran.

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,100
A close-range attack.

86
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,370
It should be some acquaintance.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
What's the time of death?

88
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,950
It should be

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,370
at 10:00 to 11:00 last night.

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,080
Captain, Master Long's subordinate Juta

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,260
is outside demanding to see you.

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Let him in.

93
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,550
Do you come for me?

94
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,850
What are you all standing here for?

95
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,200
(Juta, from Youlong Gambling House)
Go and arrest Youlan quickly.

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
I will kill her personally

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,410
to avenge Master Long.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,020
Do you mean

99
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,150
Youlan is highly suspicious?

100
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,990
Of course.

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,460
Who else could it be?

102
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,440
When did Youlan

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,410
follow Master Long?

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,360
Earlier than me.

105
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,340
She is Master Long's goddaughter.

106
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,710
After Master Long got killed,

107
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,580
she disappeared.

108
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,850
It must be her.

109
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,990
Have you seen this?

110
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,270
Isn't this what foreigners use
to light cigarettes?

111
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,260
I'm asking you, is this Master Long's?

112
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,050
Master Long never used
these foreign gadgets.

113
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,790
Last night, around 10:00 to 11:00,

114
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,630
who did Master Long meet?

115
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,660
Last night,

116
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,260
Master Long only met one person.

117
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Exactly.

118
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,370
He's also from your police station.

119
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,750
He said

120
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,490
he was Qin Weilian's son.

121
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,700
His name is

122
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,920
Huole.

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,340
When did he leave?

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
At 10:30.

125
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,360
How can you be so sure?

126
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,460
It was a coincidence.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Mr. Juta.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
What's up?

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,340
Is the thief Cheng Tianlang here?

130
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,550
No, he's not.

131
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,000
That trash.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,390
Didn't he say he would come
to repay the debt

133
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,100
before 8:00 tonight?

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,280
What time is it now?

135
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
It was 10:30.

136
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Afterwards,

137
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,810
I took my men

138
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,800
to collect the debt.

139
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,460
It took us all night

140
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,510
and we returned at dawn.

141
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,990
Unexpectedly,

142
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,340
Master Long...

143
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,110
Mr. Juta.

144
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,370
Call the men

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,840
to follow me.

146
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Hold on.

147
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,190
Captain Song,

148
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,610
I will fully cooperate with you

149
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,780
to catch the criminals,

150
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,970
but we

151
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,460
also have our own rules.

152
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,780
It's best if we don't interfere
with each other.

153
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,800
Remember,

154
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,120
no matter what you plan to do,

155
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,410
here is Jiangzhou.

156
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,320
You can't break the law.

157
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,970
A murderer should be brought to justice.

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,700
If you use lynching,

159
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,050
you're no different from the murderer.

160
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,700
I won't let you go.

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,410
Mao, Chen.

162
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,920
- Captain.
- Did Huole

163
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,220
go to the police station this morning?

164
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,450
I don't think so.

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
Go and keep an eye on Juta.

166
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,680
Youlan

167
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,620
can't fall into their hands.

168
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,390
Yes, sir.

169
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,790
There they are.

170
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,840
- Get her.
- Stop.

171
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,050
- Stop.
- Stop.

172
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,410
- Stay there.
- Stop.

173
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,300
Stop.

174
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
Stop.

175
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,180
Stop!

176
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,180
Where are you running?

177
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,900
It's a dead end.

178
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,700
Come back with me.

179
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,260
I'll make sure to leave you
a whole corpse.

180
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,260
You won't listen, huh?

181
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,460
Guys.

182
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,300
She killed Master Long.

183
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,700
Hack her to death

184
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,660
to avenge Master Long.

185
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,820
Go after her!

186
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,700
Yes.

187
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,220
He went to see Master Long yesterday.

188
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,700
I know about this.

189
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,100
Then where is he?

190
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,700
He's probably

191
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,660
still sleeping.

192
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,380
Master,

193
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,660
I just went to Young Master's room.

194
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Last night,

195
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,940
he didn't seem to come back.

196
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
This child...

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,940
Master Long was killed

198
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,300
between 10:00 and 11:00

199
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,420
last night.

200
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,940
Captain Song,

201
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,980
are you suspecting Huole?

202
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,980
No, no.

203
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,500
I'm worried about him.

204
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,820
Mr. Qin,

205
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,700
did Huole ever tell you

206
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,940
why he went to see Master Long?

207
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,940
Master.

208
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,900
No, he didn't.

209
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,500
This kid really thinks of himself
as a detective.

210
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,940
His mind is full of cases.

211
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,220
And he met Master Long.

212
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
It probably isn't for something simple.

213
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,140
You are with him all day long.

214
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Didn't you notice any signs?

215
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,980
Mr. Qin, can I take a look at his room?

216
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,140
Sure.

217
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,740
Uncle Fu,

218
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,580
quickly,

219
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,820
take Captain Song there.

220
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,860
Thank you.

221
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,740
Please.

222
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,780
(Collection of Xu Shenxing Case)

223
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,220
(Collection of Xu Shenxing Case)

224
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,700
I still haven't figured out

225
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,180
the mystery behind this case.

226
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,700
Captain Song,

227
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,180
is the Young Master alright?

228
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,820
Uncle Fu, if Huole comes back,

229
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,540
tell him to call the detective squad
immediately.

230
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,900
Don't worry, Captain Song.

231
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,780
I will tell him.

232
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,740
Deputy Commander.

233
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,660
Is everything going well?

234
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,060
Please report to the Night God.

235
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,180
According to his request,

236
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,900
(Ding Mao, from Night God Society)
Master Long and Master Du

237
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,380
have both been killed by me.

238
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,420
Now, among the three tigers of Jiangzhou,

239
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,420
only the Great Master of Huanyinglou

240
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,540
is alive.

241
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,280
You need to get rid of all three tigers
of Jiangzhou,

242
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,460
but more importantly,

243
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,780
you should make everyone believe

244
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,200
that Qin Huole is the culprit.

245
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,500
Rest assured,

246
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,740
my work

247
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,660
is flawless.

248
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,980
Night God commands

249
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,940
that Qin Huole must

250
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,620
disappear from Jiangzhou immediately

251
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,740
to make sure the detective squad

252
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,220
has no chance to turn the tables.

253
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,500
But now there's a problem.

254
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,780
The man has disappeared.

255
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,940
Are you saying

256
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,060
besides our people,

257
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,900
there are others interested in him?

258
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,300
Leave this matter to me.

259
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,060
You focus on dealing with him.

260
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,700
Night God thinks highly of you.

261
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,500
Don't let him down.

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,660
After getting rid of the three tigers
of Jiangzhou,

263
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,820
the next target

264
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,340
will be someone more significant.

265
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,780
If you do it well,

266
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
I will recommend to Night God

267
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,100
to give you more missions.

268
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,020
Thank you for your guidance.

269
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,300
I am

270
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
deeply grateful.

271
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,180
Be cautious in everything.

272
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,700
Don't be careless.

273
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,260
Name?

274
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,300
Captain Song.

275
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,780
I know what you want to ask.

276
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
Yes,

277
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,620
I killed Master Long.

278
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,900
As far as I know, Master Long has
treated you well.

279
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,780
You were the person he trusted the most.

280
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,780
- Yes.
- Why did you kill him?
