00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,820
(Fuxiang Silk Store)

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
Miss Huanyang.

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,520
Miss Huanyang.

5
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,770
Detective Qin.

6
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,750
What a coincidence.

7
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,920
Are you here to buy cloth?

8
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,750
My wedding with Shenxing is scheduled

9
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,590
for a closer date.

10
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,300
There are many things to prepare.

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,410
Could I take a bit of your time?

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
There are a few important things

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
I want to ask you about.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
Please enjoy.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,800
Thank you.

16
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,050
Detective Qin.

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,890
You can be frank with me.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,660
I will tell you everything I know.

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,990
Miss Huanyang,

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,390
I want to know

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,070
why you deliberately

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,060
got close to Xu Shenxing.

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,850
What is your true intention?

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,130
What do you mean by that?

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,920
Can't you understand

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,690
the feelings between Shenxing and me, either?

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
It's true

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,500
that I am a singing girl.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,130
- But I have been...
- Gu Sui is dead.

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
How could that be?

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,820
You are not surprised at all.

32
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,730
I don't understand what you are saying.

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,470
When a person receives shocking news,

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,640
they will stop all activities

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,900
at the first moment.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
They will look up,

37
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,450
widen their eyes,

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,900
raise their eyebrows,

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,450
and slightly open their mouth.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,450
This moment is very brief.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,910
You just deliberately

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,100
made a surprised expression.

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,220
It was quite convincing.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,640
But

45
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,010
it lasted too long.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,640
Detective Qin.

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,820
I don't understand what you are saying.

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,780
I have to leave, excuse me.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,170
I have been thinking

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,340
why this whole situation
is so awkward.

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,970
What role did Gu Sui

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,620
play in this case?

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,450
It's very obscure.

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,940
I kept speculating

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,450
in this direction.

56
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,450
Do you know what I realized?

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,380
So far,

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,520
you are the biggest beneficiary

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
in all this.

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,220
When you left Huanyinglou,

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,960
you wanted to return

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,130
to Xu Shenxing's side so much.

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,850
That's why you filled your house
with talismans.

64
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,900
Gu Sui saw you were so obsessed

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,500
and finally couldn't hold back anymore.

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,940
I like you too.

67
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,130
Shenxing.

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,060
Look who I am.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,820
Xu Shenxing.

70
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,060
You keep calling Xu Shenxing.

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100
Since you can't forget him,

72
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,780
I'll kill him with my own hands.

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,170
I'll make you hate me for a lifetime.

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,050
I want you to remember me
for a lifetime.

75
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,270
You were going to Huanyinglou

76
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,140
to stop Gu Sui,

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,710
but you met Shen Yuan

78
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,660
halfway.

79
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,610
Perhaps Shen Yuan told you

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,970
that Zhuang Si also wanted
to assassinate Xu Shenxing.

81
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,020
That changed your mind.

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,640
You decided to make good use

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,120
of Gu Sui's action this time

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,290
to rescue Xu Shenxing

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,260
and complete your final plan.

86
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,970
You know Shen Yuan
is a soft-hearted person.

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,340
So you begged him

88
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,260
to help Xu Shenxing.

89
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,700
Shen Yuan knew
he had an infectious lung disease

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,930
and he wouldn't live much longer.

91
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,340
So he agreed to your request.

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,670
Besides dying

93
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,810
for Xu Shenxing,

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,560
Shen Yuan had a more important task.

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
I think

96
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,170
that was the reason

97
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,870
why Gu Sui

98
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,410
suddenly changed his mind that night.

99
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,640
Everyone in this world

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,170
always wants a reward

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,170
for everything they do.

102
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,150
How could anyone

103
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,710
be willing to sacrifice their life

104
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,970
for someone else?

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,780
Shen Yuan's letter

106
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,200
was not to warn Xu Shenxing,

107
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
but to extort his money.

108
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,050
He agreed to my proposal

109
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,290
because I promised him

110
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,140
a sum of money to buy his life

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,170
and to mail it to his mother
in his hometown.

112
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,170
What did you make Shen Yuan do?

113
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,820
(Huanyang)
Gu Sui.

114
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,730
With me here, you can't kill Shenxing.

115
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,050
I can stop you once

116
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,490
and I can stop you again.

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,670
If you try to hurt him again,

118
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,800
I'll accompany him to hell

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,140
to become a ghost couple.

120
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,020
You knew Gu Sui well

121
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,850
and used his obsessive love for you

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,260
to trigger his abnormal mentality.

123
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,290
At that moment, he felt humiliated
and angry.

124
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,400
He decided not to let Xu Shenxing

125
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
die so easily.

126
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,050
Instead, he wanted you

127
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,880
to watch his life

128
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,710
drain away bit by bit

129
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,810
helplessly.

130
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,400
At the same time,

131
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,580
he peeled off Shen Yuan's face

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,140
to mislead everyone into thinking
Xu Shenxing was dead.

133
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,630
By doing so,

134
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,750
he aimed to stop us from investigating

135
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,850
Xu Shenxing's whereabouts.

136
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,540
But more importantly,

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,850
he was venting his anger.

138
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,990
He couldn't afford
to lose in this assassination.

139
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,280
So,

140
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,200
he couldn't wait to confirm

141
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,610
the news of Xu Shenxing's death.

142
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,870
I have to say

143
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,190
this move

144
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,050
was so risky.

145
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,490
Miss Huanyang,

146
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,020
the human heart is the hardest to predict.

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
You dared to do this,

148
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,410
either because you knew Gu Sui well

149
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,750
or

150
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,290
you had someone else behind you.

151
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Detective Qin,

152
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,520
you're known as a mind-reading detective

153
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,490
for a good reason.

154
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
That's right.

155
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,410
I used Gu Sui

156
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,350
to create an opportunity

157
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,440
for me to show my true feelings

158
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,970
for Xu Shenxing in a dire situation.

159
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,830
Only in this way

160
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,930
could Xu Shenxing accept me again

161
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,700
and even marry me.

162
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,710
Now my goal

163
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,780
has been achieved.

164
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,560
I will soon

165
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,220
become Mrs. Xu.

166
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,990
And you

167
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,150
will never be able

168
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,410
to prove your hypothesis.

169
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,340
You should congratulate me,

170
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,720
and I

171
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,850
can only say sorry to you.

172
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,700
You haven't answered my first question.

173
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,970
Why did you

174
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,900
approach Xu Shenxing?

175
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,100
Of course, it was for love.

176
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
Love?

177
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,610
If you truly love someone,

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,220
how could you bear to gamble
with his life?

179
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,340
Gu Sui's love for you
was extreme indeed.

180
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,810
But he never intended to harm you.

181
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,660
Believe it or not,

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,290
that's all I can say.

183
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
Qin Huole.

184
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,020
In the end, I still have to thank you.

185
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,690
After all,

186
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,900
you all are the most essential part

187
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,170
(Sugarcane Juice)
in this story.

188
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,790
Huanyang.

189
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,750
Huanyang.

190
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,450
- The one with the black scarf. Go after him.
- Miss.

191
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,790
Miss.

192
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,630
Song He.

193
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,560
Song He.

194
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Wake up, Song He.

195
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Wake up.

196
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,990
Are you alright?

197
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,750
Be careful.

198
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,780
Only the dead can keep secrets.

199
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,450
Lately, I always have the feeling

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,230
that a secret force

201
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,070
is lurking in Jiangcheng.

202
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,930
Same here.

203
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
I suspect

204
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,020
that Huanyang is one of them.

205
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,760
They have been scheming
so meticulously

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,790
to get close to Xu Shenxing.

207
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,140
Their target is Director Xu,

208
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,450
that is, the Jiangzhou Police Station.

209
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,330
The enemy is in the dark,

210
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,780
while we are in the light.

211
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,380
We need to be more cautious.

212
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,540
(Theater panic. The desert is beautiful
because somewhere it hides a well.)

213
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,000
Extra! Extra!

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,470
Chunshou Troupe is coming south
to perform.

215
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,310
Give me a copy.

216
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,880
Tickets to Mantangchun Theater
are hard to get.

217
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,930
Great operas starts at eight tonight.

218
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,620
(Mantangchun Theater)

219
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,210
Xiaofan, operas?

220
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,090
Yes, it's rare for Chunshou Troupe
to come.

221
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,720
The tickets were sold out long ago.

222
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,400
I got the tickets

223
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
thanks to my dad's mistress.

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,640
I know Xu Shenxing's case was closed.

225
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,540
But these past few days,

226
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,400
you've been investigating
the organization behind it

227
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,240
but had no leads so far.

228
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,360
Why not watch some operas and relax?

229
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
It's work-life balance.

230
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,210
Is this The Peony Pavilion

231
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,600
about the story of Du Liniang

232
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,660
and Liu Mengmei?

233
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,930
It seems quite interesting.

234
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,990
What do you think, Captain Song?

235
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,270
Let's go.

236
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,780
Great, then it's settled.

237
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,040
Let's meet after work

238
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,070
at the gate of the police office.

239
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,910
Don't be late.

240
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,300
(Governor's Mansion)

241
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,500
Going out with women is always a hassle.

242
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,090
They always make you wait for long.

243
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,420
(The Third Lady
of Governor's Mansion)

244
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,380
Honey.

245
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,810
What a star performer.

246
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,860
You are getting more and more beautiful.

247
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,020
It's because you dote on me.

248
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
In this world,

249
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,780
only you remember my birthday.

250
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,920
If you didn't

251
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,900
marry me,

252
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,990
the star performer
on the Mantangchun Theater stage tonight

253
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,090
would be you.

254
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,780
Do you regret it?

255
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,140
What are you talking about?

256
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,260
Being able to marry you

257
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,020
is my blessing.

258
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,900
You think

259
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,660
I don't know about your little thoughts?

260
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,860
You still haven't been able

261
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,410
to throw your opera costumes away.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
But don't worry.

263
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
Someday I'll have my men

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,260
talk to the opera troupe

265
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,410
and have the Chunshou Troupe
stay a few more days.

266
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,450
So you can have fun saying operas with them.

267
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,660
Really?

268
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Really.

269
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,440
Please.

270
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,740
Let's go.

271
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,700
(Mantangchun Theater)

272
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,100
(The Peony Pavilion. Du Xiaohe.
Cheng Zhiyuan. Zhao Xuanxue.)

273
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,780
Turn right.

274
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,540
Father, ma'am.

275
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,040
Xiaofan, the opera is about to start.

276
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,800
Why did you come so late?

277
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,900
- Hello, Commander.
- Commander Lei.

278
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,910
You three are always together.

279
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,540
Don't you get tired of each other?

280
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Then you are always with her.

281
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,810
Don't you get tired of her?

282
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,780
Look at this girl, she doesn't
even spare her own father.

283
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,330
She learned that from you.

284
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,740
She got it from you.

285
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,810
That's not bad either.

286
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,980
Captain Song. Detective Qin.

287
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,500
Sorry for the bickering.

288
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,540
Xiaofan mentions you two a lot.

289
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,620
Meeting you now,

290
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,980
I can tell you're good.

291
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,030
Ma'am,

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
happy birthday.

293
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,740
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

294
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,860
This is a brooch from Wanbao Store.

295
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,810
It's said to be the latest style
from Shanghai.

296
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,790
We two

297
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,410
seem to have forgotten it again.

298
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,020
It's okay. Commander Lei didn't
prepare anything either.

299
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,550
That's right.

300
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,600
Xiaofan is so considerate.

301
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,140
She remembered to prepare a gift for me.

302
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,110
The operas are about to start.

303
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
Let's go inside.

304
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,170
This play surely won't be
as good as your performance.

305
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,290
This place is so beautiful.

306
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,030
This is my first time at the theater.

307
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,450
Really, I'm so happy.

308
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,500
They say it's really good.

309
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,740
But previously,

310
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,430
when I was studying in Great Britain,

311
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,120
I performed in Little Women on stage.

312
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,290
I played four roles by myself.

313
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,030
Really.

314
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Even the famous playwright Mr. Maugham

315
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,900
praised me highly.

316
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,390
Four roles?

317
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,930
I think you mean you were
flat on your back.

318
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,980
Why don't you believe me?

319
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:51,910
It's beginning.

320
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,450
(Zhao Xuanxu from Chunshou Troupe)
Warbler's singing

321
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
- woke me up from my dream.
- Nice.

322
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,330
- Bravo!
- Nice.

323
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,620
Beautiful spring scenery is around.

324
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,600
What's he doing?

325
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,390
What's wrong?

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,760
This isn't the plot.

327
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,570
Liu Mengmei shouldn't appear
at this moment.

328
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,330
What's going on?

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,950
He comes on stage now.

330
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,790
What's happening?

331
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,900
Sis.

332
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,020
Since you are well-versed
in poetry and books...

333
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,190
How can Du Liniang

334
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,520
respond to Liu Mengmei now?

335
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,310
Why not compose a poem...

336
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,150
What do you mean?

337
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,120
...to appreciate this willow branch?

338
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,960
Bro,

339
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,570
I know you two have a date,

340
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,380
but isn't this a bit too hasty?

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,690
- Yes.
- Exactly.

342
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,540
Too early.

343
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,940
