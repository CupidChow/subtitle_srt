=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 9=

2
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,920
But my dad is a good person.

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,490
Why do you hate him so much?

4
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,440
When I was in my most desperate moment,

5
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,490
he gave me hope

6
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,360
and one last fantasy

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,080
about this world.

8
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,320
Then he shattered

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,250
my hope.

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,520
He made me feel like

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,410
I was the most foolish person.

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,800
He is the most detestable one.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,410
I don't agree with you.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,240
My dad is different from those people.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,410
There's no difference.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,640
The year Qin Weilian lost the lawsuit

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
for me,

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,000
I sold my property

19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,330
and left Jiangzhou.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,530
I was gone for four years.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,920
(Property Deed)
A year ago,

22
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,690
(Jushangfang)
I returned to Jiangzhou

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,640
and opened this restaurant.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,890
Welcome.

25
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,430
- This way, please.
- Recently, I heard

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,890
a new restaurant opened in Jiangzhou.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,060
Yes.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,830
The boss is a beautiful lady.

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,670
Today,

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,490
I will have a good look.

31
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,550
Please.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,040
Master Tuo.

33
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,400
Please come inside.

34
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,570
Why does she dress like this?

35
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,670
Master Tuo,

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,150
our boss

37
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,610
wants to make a living in Jiangzhou,

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,960
so she must pay her respects to you.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Therefore,

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,920
she invited you to try something new.

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
Good,

42
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,080
this is exciting.

43
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,400
I like it.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,640
Please take a seat.

45
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,960
Master Tuo has arrived.

46
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,270
Quickly, fill his cup with wine.

47
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,890
Good wine.

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
You're no longer needed. Go.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,870
Have a good time.

50
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,240
- Hurry up.
- Enjoy.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
- Watch the door.
- Okay.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,570
You're so impatient, my bride.

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,240
Well, your groom

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
won't let you down.

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,960
It's you.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
It's me,

57
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,850
the vengeful ghost who's gonna take your life.

58
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,120
The wine was poisoned.

59
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,680
The four lives of my family

60
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,170
are too much for you to repay.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Your butler Fat Jin,

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,120
Xiao Qiance,

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,000
and Zhu Gengsheng

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,920
have all paid their price.

65
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,190
I didn't expect

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,610
I would fall into your hands.

67
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,090
Don't forget.

68
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,000
The lawyer you hired.

69
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
Qin Weilian.

70
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,880
He also took my money.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,910
Say that again!

72
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,760
Why do you think

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,760
you lost the lawsuit?

74
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,610
Qin Weilian was bribed by me.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,730
He was on our side.

76
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,560
You were played fool by us.

77
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,310
Do you still think

78
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,320
I should spare Qin Weilian?

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,650
I think I understand now.

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,290
I guarantee you

81
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:41,650
that my dad

82
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,350
would never take
Little Ghost Chaser's money.

83
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,610
With what?

84
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you think I would still believe

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,090
you and your father?

86
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,170
The last time when I came,
I saw a back door.

87
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
It's here.

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
Look.

89
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,000
Sister Yun, there's noise downstairs.

90
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,110
I'll go check it out.

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
Don't move.

92
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,610
Sister Yun, someone is going upstairs!

93
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,110
Xiaofan.

94
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,430
Oh no.

95
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
It's tung oil.

96
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,050
Xiaoliu, let him come up.

97
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,110
Don't move.

98
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,160
Put the gun down.

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,720
What are you doing?

100
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,510
Qin Weilian's son

101
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,050
and that girl are in the attic.

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
If you dare to shoot,

103
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,200
I'll light this oil

104
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,050
and burn them to death.

105
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't be impulsive.

106
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,920
You can't escape.

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,040
Captain Song.

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,350
Please go to Jiangzhou prison

109
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,880
and bring Qin Weilian here.

110
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,160
Tell him

111
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm going to burn his precious son
to death.

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't be impulsive.

113
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
I can bring him here.

114
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,590
But you must ensure their safety.

115
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,410
You have no leverage
to negotiate with me.

116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,200
Go keep an eye on them.

117
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Miss Jiangyun.

118
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,850
I know you're down there.

119
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,570
This has nothing to do with Xiaofan.

120
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,480
It's a grudge between you
and my father and me.

121
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Let Xiaofan go, and you still have me.

122
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,200
Miss Jiangyun.

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,240
Miss Jiangyun.

124
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,110
- Miss...
- Stop shouting.

125
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,570
She probably won't listen to you.

126
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,640
Song He is downstairs.

127
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
He will find a way to save us.

128
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,610
Su Jiangyun is not easy to deal with.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm afraid

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,690
she might have an even bigger plan.

131
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,780
(First famous restaurant)

132
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,920
Let's go and see what's happening.

133
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,990
This must be something big.

134
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,830
The police are here.

135
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,520
Yes, so many police.

136
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,760
Who could it be?

137
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
No idea.

138
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
Is Xiaofan inside?

139
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,880
Lady Gluttony, listen up.

140
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,680
I am the Director
of Jiangzhou Police Station,

141
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
Xu Wuwen.

142
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,820
I order you
to release the hostages immediately.

143
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,040
I can spare your life.

144
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,500
(The fragrance wafts far.)

145
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,910
Sister Yun doesn't

146
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,280
want anyone else to approach.

147
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,360
Let Qin Weilian come in alone.

148
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,670
Otherwise, we'll set it on fire right now.

149
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,510
How dare you!

150
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,360
No, no.

151
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,160
They have hostages.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Captain Song.

153
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,320
Take me in.

154
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,190
Sir.

155
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,040
Lady Gluttony
is emotionally unstable now.

156
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
If we act rashly,

157
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,520
she might hurt the hostages.

158
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,400
Let me take Lawyer Qin in.

159
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,880
I promise

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,990
to bring everyone back safely.

161
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Song He.

162
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,910
You are

163
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,930
the best police officer.

164
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,560
Don't let me down.

165
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,910
Yes, sir!

166
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,040
I've brought Qin Weilian here.

167
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,850
We've shown enough sincerity.

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,240
Now,

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,850
show us your sincerity in return.

170
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,240
Let her come out and talk.

171
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,630
Captain Song.

172
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,870
Please,

173
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,570
don't hurt Miss Jiangyun.

174
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
Alright.

175
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
It's better to go out.

176
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
Could this be a trap?

177
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,550
Don't we have two more barrels of tung oil?

178
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,390
Use them.

179
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,320
Alright.

180
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,270
Someone's out.

181
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,950
It's oil.

182
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,030
What's this? Oil?

183
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,090
What are they doing?

184
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,270
Miss Jiangyun.

185
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,000
Little Ghost Chaser, Fat Jin,

186
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,390
Xiao Qiance,

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,280
and Zhu Gengsheng were already dead.

188
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,730
I was also in prison.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,160
Three days later, I will be executed.

190
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,570
Your enmity will be avenged.

191
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
Why don't you leave

192
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
and start a new life?

193
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
Wouldn't that be better?

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,970
A new life?

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,810
I've almost forgotten.

196
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,930
I am not called Lady Gluttony.

197
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,450
My name is Su Jiangyun.

198
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
That's right.

199
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,760
I killed those people.

200
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,360
You knew it was me.

201
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,330
So you found a way to hide in prison.

202
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
The law in Jiangzhou is a joke.

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,120
You collude with each other.

204
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,520
Who knows if you'll find someone
to die in your place?

205
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,870
Qin Weilian.

206
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,150
If I don't kill you with my own hands,

207
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,330
how can I be at ease?

208
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,690
Do you hate me that much?

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,810
So you are the real killer.

210
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,400
You fabricated the clock murder case

211
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,450
and framed Lawyer Qin.

212
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,690
You were all deceived by him.

213
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
You're an extreme example

214
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,640
of hypocrisy.

215
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,760
You took money from Little Ghost Chaser

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
Meanwhile, you pretended

217
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,610
to defend me in court.

218
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,810
Do you even deserve to be a lawyer?

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,280
At that time, I trusted you so much.

220
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,850
In my most desperate moment,

221
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
I thought I met a good person,

222
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,040
and I could believe in you.

223
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,500
(Presiding Judge)

224
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,880
But you were just like them.

225
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,000
You all were birds of a feather.

226
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
You were even more cruel than they were.

227
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,920
You put on a good show

228
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,090
in front of me.

229
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,610
You took money from Little Ghost Chaser

230
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,090
and pretended to help me sincerely.

231
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,330
I always thought

232
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,330
you hated me

233
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,450
because I failed you

234
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,160
and lost the lawsuit.

235
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,760
But I never took Little Ghost Chaser's money.

236
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,330
This is a gift from Master Tuo.

237
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,400
There's no need to appeal anymore.

238
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,630
Look,

239
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,360
you know who Master Tuo is.

240
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,400
He is Little Ghost Chaser.

241
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,600
We both know

242
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,690
how many lives he has taken.

243
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,570
He is still living well now, isn't he?

244
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,310
There are plenty of pretty girls.

245
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,690
Why did you have to help her
and get yourself in trouble?

246
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,630
Zhu Gengsheng,

247
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,150
from now on,

248
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,150
we are not friends anymore.

249
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,990
Get out.

250
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,990
Qin Weilian,

251
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,880
I'd leave it here.

252
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,730
You can make the decision.

253
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,110
Liar.

254
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,760
When I was at your house,

255
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
I saw Zhu Gengsheng.

256
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,190
I asked you about it

257
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,160
and you lied to me.

258
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,690
Who was that person just now?

259
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,450
He looked familiar.

260
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,990
It's someone who came to me for a lawsuit.

261
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,520
Zhu Gengsheng is dead.

262
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Whatever you say now,

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,090
there's no way to refute it.

264
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,690
After the lawsuit failed,

265
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,520
you quietly left my house.

266
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,640
I thought you were blaming me.

267
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,990
I was even worried
you might do something foolish.

268
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,910
When I heard you sold your house

269
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,850
and left for another place,

270
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,280
I felt somewhat relieved.

271
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,570
At least you
weren't in any mortal danger.

272
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,240
Until a few months ago.

273
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,000
Sir, today's newspaper.

274
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,520
Until that day, I saw in the newspaper

275
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,000
that Little Ghost Chaser was arranged

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,090
in the form of a human body clock.

277
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,040
I knew it was you.

278
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,970
You were taking revenge on me.

279
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,730
During that time,

280
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,880
there were two major news stories
in Jiangzhou.

281
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,000
One was the human clock case

282
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,240
in the Governor's Mansion.

283
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,080
The other

284
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,450
was the boss of the new Jushangfang,

285
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
who was a stunning

286
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
and beautiful chef.

287
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,960
Somehow,

288
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,910
I felt there was
an inexplicable connection

289
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,330
between these two events.

290
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,810
So I secretly came here.

291
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:38,810
(First famous restaurant.
The fragrance wafts far.)

292
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
None of your murders

293
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
escaped Lawyer Qin's eyes.

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
If he didn't

295
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
cover up

296
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,880
your isinglass with white paint,

297
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,120
I would have traced it

298
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,210
to Jushangfang long ago.

299
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,600
But,

300
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,850
at the first crime scene,

301
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,760
who moved the wall base?

302
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,270
It was me.

303
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,070
I secretly joined the construction team,

304
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,270
transported

305
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,790
Little Ghost Chaser's body inside,

306
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,120
and made it look like a human body clock.

307
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,270
Then,

308
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,640
I did something to the screen wall,

309
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,330
so that it would crack sooner.

310
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,000
Why bother spending so much effort?

311
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Miss Jiangyun.

312
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,570
I don't know why Little Ghost Chaser

313
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,330
slandered me before he died.

314
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,360
But everything I did

315
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,640
was not for myself.

316
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,680
I hoped

317
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,600
that you could be free.

318
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,520
I don't believe it.

319
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,450
Not a single word.

320
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,720
Today, the feud
between Qin Weilian and me

321
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,730
must be settled,

322
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,720
or I will burn this place down,

323
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,810
and we will die together.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,420
