=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,500
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

3
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,770
The murderer killed someone
right in front of the police.

4
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,740
This is a blatant provocation.

5
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,100
Compared to the first preview,

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,460
the time,

7
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,590
the content,

8
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,750
and the book has all changed,

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,660
but only the writing style remains the same.

10
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,580
Before the murderer engaged with us,

11
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,540
he had already calculated every step

12
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,300
very precisely.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,840
Even the appearance of corpse miasma

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,740
at Panlong Hill

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,460
was part of his plan.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,970
All these indicate

17
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,840
that the murderer's criminal behavior

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,100
is highly systematic.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
He has keen insight,

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,050
and exceptional intelligence.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,300
The ways he punished the victims

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,590
are evident that he is engaging

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,430
in a game with the police.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,380
I agree with Mr. Qin's analysis.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,380
I checked the almanac just now.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,170
Yesterday was Grain Rain Day.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,830
With the arrival of this solar term,

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,670
everything revives

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,540
and corpse miasma is bound to occur.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,340
A man chooses to commit a crime

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,150
because his inner desires

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,100
are not satisfied.

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,850
Some do it for money,

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,500
some for revenge,

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,250
and some to vent their emotions.

36
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,870
In short,

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,910
once they embark

38
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,750
on the path of crime,

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,270
their desires

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,760
will become apparent.

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,940
But the murderer in this case

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,280
has not yet shown

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,120
his desires.

44
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,170
This is the biggest challenge.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,690
Without desires,

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,340
there is no breakthrough point.

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,680
Does the murderer just want us

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
to be spectators?

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Let's split into two teams.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
On team

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,030
find outs the clues left by the murderer.

52
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,870
The other team finds out

53
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,100
why the victim was Han Da.

54
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,400
Han Da and Che Jingwen

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
must be related

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,150
somehow

57
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,030
unlike they showed.

58
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,800
We need to find the connection
between the two.

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,640
Captain Song,

60
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,540
I request to handle this part myself.

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,780
Let Chen and the others do it.

62
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,900
I am more familiar with Mr. Che.

63
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,990
It would be better

64
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,830
for me to investigate it.

65
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,290
The murderer is so brutal.

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
If something happens to you,

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,970
how can I explain it to Commander Lei?

68
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,380
Yes. Dr. Fan,

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,850
let us handle it.

70
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,010
I think we can let Xiaofan try.

71
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Xiaofan,

72
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,710
aren't you good friends
with Lieutenant Zou?

73
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,550
Ask him for help.

74
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,250
Lei's Army has many soldiers.

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,690
They can turn Jiangzhou upside down.

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
There must be some clues.

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
That's right.

78
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Mr. Qin,

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,730
thank you for helping me just now.

80
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,710
It's nothing.

81
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,830
But you have to promise me,

82
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,030
you must take Zou Jing with you

83
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,010
and protect your own safety.

84
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,270
Don't worry.

85
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,360
Recently, I visited
all the major tea houses in Jiangzhou

86
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,410
and bought a lot of tea leaves.

87
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,640
After comparison, it was confirmed

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,310
that the tea you drank
at Che Jingwen's house

89
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,400
came from Wuyuxuan.

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,710
That tea house

91
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,690
was owned by the victim Han Da.

92
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,100
(Wuyuxuan)

93
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,310
On the day you went outfor a walk,

94
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,450
you went to find this?

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,870
I see.

96
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,200
I will proceed

97
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
with this clue.

98
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,170
Okay, waiting for your good news.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,970
Mr. Huo,

100
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,950
you should be writing your novel
at home.

101
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,960
Why are you following me?

102
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
What are you up to?

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
Miss Fan, you misunderstand me.

104
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,040
How dare I have any intentions

105
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,140
to hurt you?

106
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,310
To be honest,

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,370
I have been excited all morning.

108
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,960
The incident at Panlong Hill

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
suddenly inspired me.

110
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,880
I plan to use this case as a blueprint

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
to create a new novel.

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,170
If nothing unexpected happens,

113
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,520
this work

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
will become a significant piece

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
in my writing career.

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,540
Alright, do as you please.

117
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,790
You can follow me.

118
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,970
But let me tell you,

119
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,270
you cannot interfere
with my investigation.

120
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,160
Rest assured, Miss Fan.

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,470
I promise to be so well-behaved

122
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,710
that you will forget

123
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm even here.

124
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,820
(Wuyuxuan Teahouse)

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,370
That rat,

126
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,680
I thought he was held up

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,260
by some girl from Huanyinglou.

128
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,710
I was even planning

129
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,780
to confront him when he returned,

130
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,410
but he...

131
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,290
he would never come back.

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,100
Don't you and Mr. Han

133
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,490
have any children?

134
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
Then may I ask,

135
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,100
did Mr. Han ever mention

136
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Che Jingwen to you

137
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,460
when he was alive?

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
Who?

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,020
Che Jingwen.

140
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,850
Before Mr. Han disappeared,

141
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,930
did he have any unusual behavior,

142
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,790
or did anyone

143
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,730
frequently come to see him?

144
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,070
Or,

145
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,320
did he mention someone

146
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,260
to you multiple times?

147
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,050
I really can't remember anything.

148
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,510
Miss Fan,

149
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,950
(Wuyuxuan Teahouse)
where are we going next?

150
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,920
It's almost mealtime.

151
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,520
I want to treat you to a meal.

152
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,610
I can't allow you to investigate
on an empty stomach.

153
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
I heard Jushangfang has reopened.

154
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,880
The new boss, Qingyao,

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,440
is also a great cook.

156
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,370
How about I treat you to a taste?

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,610
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

158
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,940
(Jushangfang)

159
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,540
(Jushangfang Reopens)

160
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,930
You must be Qingyao.

161
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,230
My father told me

162
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,520
that Miss Jiangyun's Jushangfang

163
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,470
has reopened

164
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,310
thanks to you.

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,540
Lawyer Qin helped me before.

166
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,930
He asked me a favor.

167
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,970
I couldn't turn him down.

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,810
Your cooking skills are
as good as Miss Jiangyun's.

169
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,470
Thank you for the compliment, Miss Fan.

170
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,320
The meal is on the house.

171
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,150
Please enjoy it.

172
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,370
That won't do.

173
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Mr. Huo said

174
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,730
he's paying the bill today.

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,520
Yes. I said I would pay the bill.

176
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,020
These dishes are nothing.

177
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,700
Just give me a discount.

178
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,340
Alright, then I won't disturb you two.

179
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
Enjoy your meal.

180
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,460
Miss Fan, please sit.

181
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,560
Miss Fan, you've worked hard on the case.

182
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,540
Eat more.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,850
I'm willing to be at your service.

184
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,270
If you need my help,

185
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,340
just let me know.

186
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,900
In the future,

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
if there's an opportunity,

188
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,590
please speak well of me

189
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,910
in front of the Commander.

190
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,030
Maybe write a preface for my new book.

191
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,870
I would be

192
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,260
so grateful.

193
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,520
So grateful.

194
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,360
Mr. Huo,

195
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,710
I have a question
that I've been curious about.

196
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,640
I hope you can enlighten me.

197
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,520
Miss Fan,

198
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,050
just call me Huo.

199
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,790
Feel free to ask any questions.

200
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,050
I will tell you everything I know.

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Huo,

202
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
in your opinion,

203
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,080
what else could

204
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Mr. Che and Han Da

205
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,020
have in common?

206
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,140
Well,

207
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,370
Che Jingwen has no friends.

208
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,900
It seems like

209
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,620
he doesn't need friends either.

210
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,690
I don't know

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,210
why he chose to live like a monk.

212
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,050
My debut work,

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,780
The Death Lantern,

214
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,430
wouldn't have been published

215
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,170
without his help.

216
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,570
But even so,

217
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,210
I never felt that Jingwen

218
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,900
truly opened up to me.

219
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,400
So the only time

220
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,450
he and Han Da could meet

221
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,140
is probably

222
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,090
when they went to Wuyuxuan to buy tea.

223
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,680
It seems

224
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,170
I don't really know Mr. Che at all.

225
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,570
Given Mr. Che Jingwen's character,

226
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,050
what he considered precious

227
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,690
is certainly not precious
in the worldly sense.

228
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,150
That tea

229
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,900
must have special meaning to him.

230
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,740
You mean,

231
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,870
there is such a person

232
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,950
who is particularly important

233
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,790
to Che Jingwen.

234
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,270
He once bought tea at Wuyuxuan Teahouse,

235
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,480
and then gave it to Che Jingwen.

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,320
Is it right?

237
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,740
We cannot rule out this possibility.

238
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,790
This person who is very important
to Che Jingwen

239
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,900
is the key to this case.

240
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,270
That's right.

241
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,900
You go to Che Jingwen's house now.

242
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,150
No matter what,

243
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I think this person

244
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,450
must have appeared in his life before.

245
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,980
According to
Locard's Exchange Principle,

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,810
whether it's a person or an object,

247
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,450
when the two meet,

248
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,540
there are only two results:

249
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,110
First,

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,500
something is left behind.

251
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,630
Second,

252
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,410
something is taken away.

253
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,090
Alright, I'll go now.

254
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,090
Aren't you coming with me?

255
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,380
You go to Mr. Che's house.

256
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll stay here
and read Huo Qingxin's third novel

257
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,840
to look for clues.

258
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,240
The two of us

259
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,760
are the best partners.

260
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,600
Miss Fan,

261
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,140
I just thought of something.

262
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,140
- Quickly, tell me.
- At that time,

263
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
the novel The Death Lantern

264
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,810
sold very well.

265
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,980
So the publishing house asked me
to write a sequel,

266
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,170
still with Cheng Sen as the protagonist.

267
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,760
But the first few paragraphs

268
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,170
were challenging to me.

269
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,570
So I asked

270
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,050
Jingwen for some advice.

271
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,910
Jingwen,

272
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,120
please help me.

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,520
Look, I've been troubled by it

274
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,360
for several days now.

275
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
If you don't help me,

276
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,330
what am I going to do?

277
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,790
I'm afraid I can't today.

278
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,980
I have to go to Nu Mountain.

279
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,020
Jingwen, please be kind.

280
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm really sorry, Qingxin.

281
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,110
I have an appointment
early in the morning

282
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,280
with Monk Chenhai from Xiyin Temple.

283
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,000
I absolutely cannot miss it.

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,580
When I have time,
I will definitely help you.

285
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,240
Jingwen.

286
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,980
This Monk Chenhai

287
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
was probably

288
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,810
Jingwen's only...

289
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,150
Friend?

290
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Hard to say.

291
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,050
But maybe

292
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,260
it's someone he cares about.

293
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,500
Miss Fan, where are you going?

294
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,120
What are you still standing there for?

295
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,400
Let's go to Xiyin Temple now

296
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
and meet Monk Chenhai.

297
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,910
It's a long way to Xiyin Temple.

298
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,810
We need to solve
the transportation issue first.

299
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,760
Miss Fan, I can take you there.

300
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,640
But you need to tell me

301
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,900
why you are going to Xiyin Temple.

302
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,360
Commander already scolded me

303
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,500
for what happened at Panlong Hill.

304
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,860
You shouldn't have told him.

305
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,120
But I must tell him.

306
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,210
Are you going or not?

307
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,810
Lieutenant Zou.

308
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,020
Lieutenant Zou, we meet again.

309
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,980
Mr. Huo, what are you doing here?

310
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,190
Lieutenant Zou.

311
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,450
It's a long story.

312
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,150
I'm here for my next novel.

313
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,030
Alright.

314
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,930
Stop wasting time with him.

315
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,600
The situation is urgent now.

316
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,930
We must leave immediately.

317
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,600
Lieutenant Zou

318
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,190
must be busy with official duties.

319
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,030
How about

320
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,380
I go with you, Miss Fan?

321
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,000
I can drive.

322
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
No need.

323
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,550
Xiyin Temple is in a remote location.

324
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,030
It's safer if I take Miss Fan there.

325
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,930
So tedious.

326
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,050
I really can drive.

327
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,870
Mao Shuai.

328
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
Uh...

329
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,090
It's okay.

330
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,170
- Sorry, I...
- It's okay.

331
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,480
Thank you.

332
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,820
(Cheng Sen felt a sudden jolt.
This Haunted House has been eerie.)

333
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,750
Look at this part.

334
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,910
Cheng Sen felt a sudden jolt.

335
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,620
This Parrot Tomb has been eerie.

336
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
Cheng Sen felt a sudden jolt.

337
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,290
This Haunted House has been eerie.

338
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,480
Except for changing Parrot Tomb

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,640
to Haunted House,

340
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,930
everything else remains unchanged.

341
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,110
That's right.

342
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,190
I understand.

343
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,030
That means

344
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
the third target

345
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,740
might be hidden in the Haunted House.

346
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,620
It's not like that.

347
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,150
Because the Haunted House
at the end of the book

348
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,140
was completely burned down by a fire.

349
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,240
Doesn't this exactly correspond to

350
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,930
"I couldn't extinguish that flame"?

351
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,080
Yes,

352
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,140
the two paragraphs are exactly the same.

353
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,280
(Cheng Sen felt a sudden jolt.
This Haunted House has been eerie.)

354
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,580
(Cheng Sen's heart skipped a beat.
This Parrot Tomb has always been eerie.)

355
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,430
(Haunted House. Parrot Tomb.)

356
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,760
The Haunted House was burned down,

357
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,860
leaving only the Parrot Tomb.

358
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
So,

359
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,570
the murderer's third target

360
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,930
is still at Panlong Hill.

361
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,340
(Panlong Hill)

362
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,340
(This work's exclusive right to
