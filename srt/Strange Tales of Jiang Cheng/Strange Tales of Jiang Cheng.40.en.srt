=Episode 40=

2
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,680
Got hit?

3
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,990
Not yet.

4
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,350
Don't just stand there.

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,200
Let's go home.

6
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,630
Stop right there.

7
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,930
You take Xiaofan back
to the station first.

8
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,270
What about you?

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
I'll do some exercise.

10
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,910
Catch him.

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,760
My house is nearby. Let's go there.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,670
I'll ask my father to send troops
to rescue Song He.

13
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,510
Alright.

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
Run.

15
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,110
Go.

16
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,110
Come on.

17
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,340
Why did we circle back?

18
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm really not familiar with Jiangzhou.

19
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,180
They are after you.

20
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,620
They won't do anything to me.

21
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,500
I'll find a way to stall them.

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,480
You take the chance to escape.

23
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,320
I won't leave you behind.

24
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,100
A police officer never leaves
his comrade behind.

25
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,830
- Go.
- Go.

26
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,510
You're here.

27
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,670
Miss, are you alright?

28
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,180
I'm fine. Except for a sprained ankle.

29
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,740
Quick, go save Song He.

30
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
- Qingmang, stay here to protect Miss.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,090
Everyone, follow me.

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,930
Song He,

33
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,320
seriously,

34
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,550
who the heck

35
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,390
are you?

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,500
You're so good.

37
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,390
Come on.

38
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,300
I'll fight you to the end.

39
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,950
Song He.

40
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Come here.

41
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
Lieutenant Zou.

42
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,150
What are you doing?

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Get lost.

44
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,950
Mr. Juta.

45
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,250
We can't fight bullets.

46
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,470
Let's retreat.

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Go.

48
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,630
Retreat.

49
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
Where's Xiaofan?

50
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,370
Where are Xiaofan and Huole?

51
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
Qingmang's there.

52
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,180
That's impressive.

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,660
How about joining Lei's Army?

54
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,580
(Qin Residence)

55
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,930
Who exactly are you?

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,250
Young Master, you're awake.

57
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,890
Master, Young Master is awake.

58
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,980
Young Master.

59
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,250
You have no idea.

60
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,360
The Master was so worried

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,740
when he saw your wanted notice

62
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,250
all over the streets and alleys.

63
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,400
Yesterday, the Master told me

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,750
if there's no news of you soon,

65
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,550
he will sell this house

66
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,570
for silver dollars to find you

67
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,960
until you're found.

68
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
Uncle Fu.

69
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
You may leave.

70
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,100
I'll go make you something delicious.

71
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm leaving.

72
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,910
Dad.

73
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,420
Do you know how I've been
these past two days?

74
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,370
If something had really happened to you,

75
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,810
what should I do?

76
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,030
Dad,

77
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,860
I'm home now, aren't I?

78
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,370
I'll be more careful.

79
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,250
I've heard

80
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,100
if it weren't for Song He and Xiaofan,

81
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,560
you would have...

82
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,270
Dad.

83
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,180
Dad, I promise you.

84
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,930
I'll spend more time at home with you.

85
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,590
Really?

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,420
No more going to the police station?

87
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,980
I can apply for a leave.

88
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,220
You...

89
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,590
Dad,

90
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,890
being a detective is my dream.

91
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,570
How can I give up so easily?

92
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,010
You probably heard as well.

93
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,110
This time the murderer is extraordinary.

94
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,960
No one can handle it but me.

95
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,100
How do you know no one else
can handle it but you?

96
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,630
I've never expected you

97
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,180
to achieve anything remarkable.

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,810
Whether I sent you to study abroad

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,250
or agreed to let you stay in Jiangzhou,

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
I just hoped you could

101
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,220
be safe and happy.

102
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,370
But I am very happy now.

103
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,570
I'm just like you.

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,370
We both believe in justice
and law deep down.

105
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,500
I believe you can understand me.

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,430
Otherwise,

107
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,310
why would you have studied overseas in law

108
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,180
and become a revered lawyer?

109
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,770
Dad, I promise you.

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,110
No matter what,

111
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,500
I will come back safely.

112
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,510
Pinky swear.

113
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,950
Promise me

114
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,500
to take a break.

115
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,590
Alright.

116
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,580
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
Detective Qin.

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,440
Detective Qin.

119
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,130
I've missed you so much.

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,990
Detective Qin, it's so great
that you came back safely.

121
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,490
We all believe

122
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,910
that you are definitely
not the murderer.

123
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,450
- Yes, yes.
- Exactly.

124
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,040
- Definitely not the murderer.
- I believe in you too.

125
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,390
- Definitely not.
- We all believe in you.

126
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,230
Thank you, everyone.

127
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Detective Qin.

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,820
I didn't give out a single one

129
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,130
of the wanted notices Captain gave me.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,130
Good man.

131
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,320
In that case,

132
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,770
I'll make coffee for you soon.

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,200
One cup each.

134
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,060
Nice.

135
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,170
- Nice.
- Nice!

136
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,370
Where's Captain Song?
Didn't he come to work?

137
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,500
He went to see Director Xu
as soon as he arrived today.

138
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,620
(Director's Office)

139
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,320
Your wanted notice

140
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
has not been revoked yet.

141
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,960
Why did you come to the police station?

142
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,990
Are you turning yourself in?

143
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,960
How about you arresting me

144
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,800
personally

145
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,700
to earn some merit?

146
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,340
Alright.

147
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,360
If you arrest me,

148
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
where will you find

149
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,250
such a good partner like me?

150
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,230
Besides,

151
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,900
didn't you come to see Director Xu this morning

152
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,860
to solve this issue?

153
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,620
Although there are new clues,

154
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,530
your suspicion hasn't been completely
cleared yet.

155
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,620
Director Xu only agreed for you
to assist in the investigation.

156
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,290
It is fine.

157
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
I bought breakfast.

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,860
Let's have some.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,250
Take it easy.

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,650
Does it hurt?

161
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,130
- Should I carry you?
- Get lost.

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,410
I have to say, you're quite good
at martial arts.

163
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,150
- I think.
- You don't need to say that.

164
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,990
You're better than Gu Sui.

165
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,250
Come on, let me check.

166
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,110
Get off me.

167
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,390
Early this morning,
the Captain has had people conduct

168
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,200
a thorough investigation
on this shoe print.

169
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
If we can find out where the shoes
are from,

170
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,030
then we can trace the movements

171
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,650
of the bald suspect.

172
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,620
These shoes

173
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,990
are not something

174
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,000
you can buy in ordinary markets.

175
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,050
It's because they are special

176
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,290
that they were replaced.

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,500
He should come from a special place.

178
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
This place

179
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,410
should also have
a standardized management system.

180
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,750
For example,

181
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,640
a prison.

182
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Of course,

183
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,850
it also includes the police station.

184
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,820
Mao, Chen.

185
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,980
Notify them not to waste time
on shoe stores,

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,580
and immediately change the direction.

187
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
Focus on the places

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,890
that Huole just mentioned.

189
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,100
Although I have seen you
hypnotize Gu Sui,

191
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,170
I still have some doubts.

192
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,580
In such a short time,

193
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,240
how did the murderer

194
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,340
control a stranger

195
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,340
to make him willingly commit a crime?

196
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,130
This is indeed a master.

197
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,890
Even if it were me,

198
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,410
in such a short time,

199
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,220
I might not succeed.

200
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,170
Are you saying he is a genius?

201
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,160
A genius

202
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,050
would not make such a basic mistake.

203
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
Maybe the murderer

204
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,620
knows some unknown criminal techniques.

205
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,740
There are actually some precedents

206
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,740
of a murderer using this method.

207
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,070
In the West,

208
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,840
there was a criminal genius

209
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
named Dr. Sells.

210
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,710
This person

211
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,130
was skilled at creating memory confusion

212
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,700
and blurring reality,

213
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,500
so he committed many crimes.

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,980
Was he never caught?

215
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,280
Later,

216
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
he became obsessed
with studying psychoanalysis

217
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,290
and went mad.

218
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,910
He was crazy all day long

219
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,400
and eventually died

220
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,670
in a suburban psychiatric hospital.

221
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,220
Did he always act alone?

222
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,870
You hit the nail on the head.

223
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,890
According to the police,

224
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,040
he had

225
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,680
no less than 20 disciples.

226
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,770
Over 20 disciples?

227
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,130
Even if only a third of them spread out,

228
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,220
the evil techniques he studied

229
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,770
could be widely disseminated.

230
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,080
Could the murderer in this case

231
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,100
also be one of his disciples?

232
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,410
Although he and the murderer

233
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,890
have no direct connection,

234
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,290
it's still possible.

235
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,820
No way.

236
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
You are talking about Europe,

237
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,680
but we are in Jiangzhou.

238
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,500
That's thousands of miles away.

239
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,530
In 1601,

240
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,240
the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci

241
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,620
had already been to Beijing.

242
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,600
I think the most important task

243
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
is to figure out

244
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
the murderer's motive first.

245
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
This way, we can gather more clues

246
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
and bring him to justice
as soon as possible.

247
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,100
I need to see Youlan.

248
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,820
(Interrogation Room)

249
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,110
Qin Huole, I will kill you!

250
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,950
Miss Youlan,

251
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,980
the detective squad got new clues

252
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,250
and found a new suspect.

253
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,750
Director Xu has specially approved Qin Huole

254
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,100
to assist the squad in solving the case

255
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,800
and clear his name.

256
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Miss Youlan,

257
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,460
I would like you to carefully recall

258
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,020
what happened in the seven days

259
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,990
before Master Long got killed.

260
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,950
Did he encounter anyone

261
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,790
special during that time?

262
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,500
Did anything unusual happen?

263
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,500
There are so many people
in the gambling house.

264
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,230
How can I remember clearly?

265
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,070
Alright.

266
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,890
Let me rephrase it.

267
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,150
In the seven days

268
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,990
before Master Long died,

269
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,530
were there any people who shouldn't
have been at the gambling house

270
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,680
coming to see Master Long?

271
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,830
Is that

272
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
clear now?

273
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,030
If you had said it like that earlier,

274
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,010
I would have understood.

275
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,640
Miss Youlan,

276
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,010
please think about it carefully.

277
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,620
Was there anyone who fit the description?

278
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,530
I can only think

279
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,990
of two individuals.

280
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,770
You must be Miss Qingyao.

281
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,620
Yes.

282
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,560
(Youlong Gambling House)
Master Long is waiting for you.

283
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,400
Please.

284
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,350
Thank you.

285
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,050
Qingyao from Jushangfang and Zou Jing.

286
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,130
Qingyao and Zou Jing?

287
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,680
Why would Qingyao and Zou Jing

288
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,500
get involved in the case?

289
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,820
We need to ask them.

290
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,230
I'll go and ask Zou Jing.

291
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,410
Alright, let's split up.

292
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,110
Wait.

293
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
What's wrong?

294
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,580
Your name hasn't been cleared yet.

295
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,940
It's better if you stay out of sight.

296
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,680
I'll go and ask Qingyao.

297
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,340
You wait for us at the police station.

298
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,710
Alright.

299
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,070
Let's go.

300
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,380
(Jushangfang)

301
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Thank you.

302
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,910
Captain Song.

303
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,100
Why did you come alone?

304
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,100
Isn't Huole with you?

305
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,710
Sorry,

306
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,130
I forgot he's now a suspect.

307
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,340
It's okay. I came today

308
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,890
to see you, Miss Qingyao.

309
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,560
I don't know

310
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,630
how I can

311
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,470
help you.

312
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,360
A few days ago, did you go

313
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,270
to Youlong Gambling House

314
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,110
to find Master Long?

315
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,200
Why?

316
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,530
Huole is not the murderer?

317
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,660
