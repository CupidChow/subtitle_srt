=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 47=

2
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,590
You Youyou.

3
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,950
What's going on?

4
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,940
As soon as I came in,

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,110
I saw Sanbao lying on the ground.

6
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,950
I quickly came over

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,960
to check if he was still breathing.

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,670
Just as I bent down,

9
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,610
I felt something behind me.

10
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,030
I turned my head

11
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,310
and saw a masked person darting away.

12
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,740
In the blink of an eye, he's gone.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,640
This definitely wasn't done

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,380
by someone inside our prison.

15
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,750
There's an outsider.

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,870
What do you mean?

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,530
Look at that knife wound.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,740
It's neat and swift.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,840
Although it avoided the vital organs

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,690
and wasn't fatal,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
for Sanbao to wake up,

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,100
it would take about half a month.

23
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,780
With this capability,

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,190
there's really no one in our prison

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,890
who could pull it off.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,310
You Youyou.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,020
You know the price of lying.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,720
Captain Chen.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,220
I've lived here

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,550
for way more years

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,100
than you.

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,860
Besides, in this lifetime,

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,220
I'm afraid I won't be able to leave.

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
So how would I

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,500
dare to lie to you?

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,380
(Mend Your Ways)

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,060
(Jushangfang)

38
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,340
(Bomb)

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,060
So they want to blow up the river dike.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,250
When the dike breaks, the river
will flood the city.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
By then,

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,620
Jiangzhou will become a vast ocean.

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,970
(I must inform Song He
about the situation.)

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
(Phone.)

45
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,250
(I need to find a phone.)

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,980
(Captain's Office)

47
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,300
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
There's fighting.

49
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,600
- Stop fighting.
- Hit him.

50
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,490
Everyone squat down.

51
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,480
Go.

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,520
Stop fighting.

53
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,030
Go, hit him.

54
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,870
Hit him.

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,800
What are you doing?

56
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,580
Who started this?

57
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,630
Stand properly.

58
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,190
It's this old guy.

59
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
You Youyou.

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
In the past, the warden took care of you.

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,340
Whatever you did, I turned a blind eye.

62
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,820
But let me tell you,

63
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,820
you went too far today.

64
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,900
Take him away and confine him up
for ten days.

65
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
- Move.
- Move.

67
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,600
Captain Chen,

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,610
you can't just lock me up.

69
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,700
You old man.

70
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,070
Captain,

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,270
if you lock him up for ten days,

72
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,110
I'm afraid...

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,140
I don't care if he can survive.

74
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,030
Ten days of confinement, not a day less.

75
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,340
- Take him away!
- Yes, sir.

76
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,350
- Move.
- Move.

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,610
Listen up, everyone.

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,660
No matter how things were before,

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,100
starting today,

80
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,990
if anyone dares to cause trouble again,

81
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,700
this will be your punishment.

82
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,530
Hello, detective squad?

83
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,670
Yes.

84
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,110
Who are you looking for?

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,140
Chen, it's me.

86
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,990
I'm Qin Huole. Is Song He there?

87
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,230
I guarantee not a word will be missed.

88
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,340
Officer Chen, hurry.

89
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,820
Freshly baked buns.

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,370
Eat them while they're hot.

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,800
I wasn't hungry at first,

92
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
but when I saw the food you bought,

93
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,290
my stomach started growling.

94
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,020
Follow my hand gestures

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,490
and read out the numbers.

96
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,870
This way,

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,100
the restraints on you

98
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,260
will soon be lifted.

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
One.

100
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,070
Two.

101
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,160
Two.

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,430
Three.

103
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Four.

104
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,870
Now,

105
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,050
slowly go back with me to the past.

106
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,100
(With a Clear Conscience)

107
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,110
What's going on?

108
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
I...

109
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,700
I just heard gunshots outside,

110
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,900
so I went out to check.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,260
The screwdriver fell to the ground,

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,880
and when I picked it up,

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,460
I accidentally knocked over the vase.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
Be careful.

115
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,580
Someone will bring you food later.

116
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,630
No need.

117
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,410
I don't want anyone to disturb me,

118
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,290
including you.

119
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,100
(Jushangfang)

120
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,060
(Closed)

121
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,060
(Closed)

122
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
Detective squad.

123
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,230
Is anyone here?

124
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,710
Captain, ever since Jushangfang opened,

125
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,850
I've felt something was off.

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Could it be a trap?

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,180
You stay down here.

128
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,190
I'll go up to take a look.

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,240
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,190
Captain,

131
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,550
be careful.

132
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,060
The door is open.

133
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Please come in.

134
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,470
Miss Qingyao,

135
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,830
this is a routine investigation
by the detective squad.

136
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,820
Please come downstairs.

137
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,950
I have some questions for you.

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
Captain Song.

139
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,100
I'm not afraid as a woman.

140
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,180
What are you afraid of?

141
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,200
Besides,

142
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
it's inconvenient for me to go out now.

143
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,300
If you have something to say,
please come in.

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Excuse me.

145
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,650
It's so late.

146
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,970
I wonder why you're looking for me.

147
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,350
What's the matter?

148
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,820
I want to ask you about someone.

149
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Huo Qingxin.

150
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,970
Wasn't he detained by you?

151
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,750
Yes, but today

152
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,010
he appeared in Jushangfang.

153
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
Really?

154
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,850
I don't recall that.

155
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,920
I heard

156
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,250
that he took a suitcase from you.

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,250
Captain Song,

158
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,250
are you mistaken?

159
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,580
There are many customers here.

160
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,610
It's common for people to come in
with suitcases,

161
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,770
but taking a suitcase away?

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,890
That's absolutely unheard of.

163
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,490
You really didn't see Huo Qingxin?

164
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,120
Captain Song,

165
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,820
can you do me a favor?

166
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,940
Help me get that comb.

167
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,490
It's just a comb.

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,420
If you help me get it,

169
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,370
I'll tell you

170
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,370
what you want to know.

171
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,610
Forget it.

172
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
It seems

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,610
you don't want to know either.

174
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,970
Captain Song,

175
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,300
comb my hair for me.

176
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,350
I didn't expect

177
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,370
the captain of the detective squad

178
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,340
be scared of me.

179
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,430
By the way,

180
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,370
what did you just ask me?

181
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,490
I wanted to know

182
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,370
if you saw Huo Qingxin today.

183
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,180
I already said

184
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,250
I've never seen him.

185
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,370
So it was you.

186
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,220
Yes, it was me.

187
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
Officer Mao.

188
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,950
Who?

189
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,950
Lieutenant Zou,

190
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,120
why are you here?

191
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,700
Just happened to be nearby.

192
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,670
Where's Song He?

193
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,440
It's good that you're here.

194
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,470
He is upstairs.

195
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,310
I was worried...

196
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,370
It really was you.

197
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,890
I only kill in novels.

198
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,590
Where is he?

199
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
How is it?

200
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,470
He was taken away.

201
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,800
But I shot him, and he's seriously
injured.

202
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,850
He won't be a threat to us.

203
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,830
By the way, it's about time.

204
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,750
I need to head back now.

205
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,220
Otherwise, Lei Hai will be suspicious.

206
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,250
You wait here for Chen Zou
and Ma Xiaonian,

207
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,970
and deal with him in the meantime.

208
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,300
I'll meet you at the agreed location.
Don't be late.

209
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,850
- Okay.
- Alright.

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,300
What do you want to say, Mr. Huo?

211
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,730
I can't believe

212
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,580
that your martial arts skills

213
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,340
are so remarkable.

214
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,580
Back then, my father and my brother

215
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,940
died in the chaos of war.

216
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,540
If Mr. Night God didn't take me in,

217
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,750
my best situation now

218
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,830
would be to end up

219
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,700
like those girls at Huanyinglou.

220
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,730
So I am grateful to Mr. Night God.

221
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,420
I have practiced my swordsmanship
day and night

222
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,680
to wait for such an opportunity

223
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,700
like today

224
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,060
to repay his kindness.

225
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,580
I have dealt with Song He before.

226
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,950
With his skills,

227
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,340
if you weren't capable,

228
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,730
it would be really hard to get past him.

229
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,060
It's not that I am capable,

230
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,010
but that Mr. Night God
is a good strategist.

231
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,340
Well said.

232
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,430
Mr. Huo,

233
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,080
let's deal with the body first.

234
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
Alright.

235
