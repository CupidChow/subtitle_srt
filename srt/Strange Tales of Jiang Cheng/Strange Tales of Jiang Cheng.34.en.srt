2
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,610
Zhiyuan.

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,100
Don't move. You just took your medicine.

4
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,050
Uncle Xi was...

5
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,020
I will take good care of you.

6
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,750
Uncle Xi.

7
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,020
I have always taken you as my family.

8
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,130
I know

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,580
you really want to play Du Liniang.

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,660
You are also not willing
to spend your whole life

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,540
just playing Chunxiang, right?

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,660
Zhiyuan will give me a chance.

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,300
Don't be silly.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,990
He is a murderer.

15
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,960
You don't still want to marry him,
do you?

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,660
Zhiyuan was framed.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,620
Do you want to know

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,310
who framed

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,900
Cheng Zhiyuan?

20
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,340
Who exactly was it?

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,060
No one framed him.

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,780
Everything

23
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,100
was his own intention.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,660
Zhiyuan wouldn't be so heartless.

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,150
He wouldn't.

26
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,550
Besides,

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,100
what good does it do to you

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,900
to kill Xuanxue?

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,340
Only if Zhao Xuanxue died,

30
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,850
Leader Chen's death

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,970
would make sense.

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,390
Think about it,

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,830
Leader Chen gave everything he had

34
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,290
to make Zhao Xuanxue a star performer.

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,270
And what happened?

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,820
It was all

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,780
for nothing.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,130
He couldn't take the blow

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
and committed suicide.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,540
Isn't that quite normal?

41
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,950
You...

42
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,450
You want to replace Leader Chen

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,130
and be the new leader
of the Chunshou Troupe.

44
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,850
He kindly took you in.

45
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,620
How can you do this?

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
Xiaohe,

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,570
at this point,

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,850
you are still speaking for him.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,590
You should worry

50
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,780
more about yourself.

51
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
You...

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,150
Miss Xiaohe,

53
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,900
I brought Cheng Zhiyuan to see you.

54
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,450
As for Zhao Xuanxue's death...

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Xiaohe,

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,130
I did it.

57
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,110
It's true.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,600
Xiaohe,

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,970
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,480
Zhiyuan,

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,030
why did you do it?

62
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,220
Why?

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,620
What about Du Xiaohe?

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,220
Du Xiaohe.

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,610
She is the most crucial part

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,140
of my entire plan.

67
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,970
If you find out

68
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,580
that Leader Chen's death was not a suicide,

69
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,350
then she will be

70
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,580
the most wonderful part.

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,930
Because she's the murderer

72
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,900
I chose.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,730
I even thought of the motive for her.

74
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,540
She was jealous of Zhao Xuanxue.

75
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,900
She joined the troupe earlier
than Zhao Xuanxue,

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,580
but could only play Chunxiang
all the time.

77
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,610
She longed to play Du Liniang.

78
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,200
But Leader Chen

79
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,050
was her biggest obstacle.

80
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,050
Even if Zhao Xuanxue died,

81
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,790
he still wouldn't give her a chance.

82
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,630
No need to say more.

83
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
This case

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
can be closed.

85
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,260
Xuanxue,

86
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,610
I am your good sister Xiaohe.

87
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,370
Are you there?

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,810
Without you,

89
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,260
how can I continue

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,260
to perform The Peony Pavilion?

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,370
Without Du Liniang,

92
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,810
where will Chunxiang go?

93
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,540
Sis, can you hear me?

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
She can hear you.

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
You...

96
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,040
Du Xiaohe,

97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,020
your play is good.

98
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,900
I really have to say,

99
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,850
you have already been a star performer.

100
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,260
Captain Song,

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,670
what is Detective Qin talking about?

102
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,610
I don't understand.

103
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,670
Why are you

104
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,610
being so ironic?

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,700
Haven't you seen it?

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,710
Miss Xiaohe has already put on

107
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,730
Du Liniang's makeup.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,730
I rushed over to help her
put on the costume,

109
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,070
otherwise,

110
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,140
Du Liniang would be missing something.

111
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,670
Miss Xiaohe,

112
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,520
Zhao Xuanxue's clothes

113
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,970
are now draped over you.

114
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Put them on,

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,660
and you are Du Liniang now.

116
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,660
Tell me.

117
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,170
Do I

118
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,170
look better

119
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,970
than Xuanxue

120
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,810
with this costume on?

121
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,870
To be honest,

122
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,810
this costume

123
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,480
looks better on you

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,460
than on Zhao Xuanxue.

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
Are you telling the truth?

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,140
Although I don't understand this opera,

127
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,540
from your movements just now,

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,700
even Zhao Xuanxue would have

129
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,900
to admire you.

130
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,330
Warbler's singing

131
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,140
woke me up from my dream.

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Mr. Cheng,

133
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,170
Du Liniang has already taken the stage.

134
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,220
What is Liu Mengmei still waiting for?

135
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't misunderstand.

136
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,520
Xiaohe was usually obsessed with opera.

137
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,200
Is it worth dying

138
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
for someone

139
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
who doesn't care about you?

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Don't you think

141
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,970
she is using you?

142
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,980
My mind is a clutter.

143
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,170
I couldn't clear it.

144
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,630
Uncle Xi,

145
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,620
actually, we already knew.

146
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,540
You are not the murderer.

147
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,070
Is it worth dying for someone

148
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,540
who doesn't care about you?

149
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,840
Don't you think she is using you?

150
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,680
No.

151
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,980
I am the murderer.

152
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,390
I am the murderer.

153
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,810
Haven't you already closed the case?

154
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,540
Hurry up and convict me.

155
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,910
I really am the murderer.

156
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,520
I am the murderer.

157
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,560
I don't know what your family

158
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,930
would think if they knew

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
what you did.

160
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,210
But if I were your daughter,

161
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,050
I would never forgive you.

162
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,330
Never.

163
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,200
You...

164
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
What are you doing?

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,620
Hurry up and handcuff me.

166
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,950
I really am the murderer.

167
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,170
I am the murderer.

168
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,450
Since the whole thing

169
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,170
started from this stage,

170
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,570
ending it here

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,860
might not be a bad idea.

172
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,330
What exactly are you trying to say?

173
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,680
Don't rush.

174
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,540
We will definitely catch
the right person.

175
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,600
Now,

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,410
I need to review the case
from the beginning.

177
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,090
At first,

178
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,740
I didn't understand

179
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,380
how could someone

180
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,190
be so cruel as to make the person

181
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,480
who loved her

182
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,540
kill her in public?

183
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,410
No matter what the reason is,

184
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,540
it's too cold-blooded.

185
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,930
So I developed another theory

186
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,290
and reached the only answer.

187
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,450
Why do you have to do this?

188
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,570
Zhiyuan,

189
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,690
I owe you.

190
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,900
I can only repay you in the next life.

191
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,260
After singing The Peony Pavilion
for so many years,

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,600
in the end,

193
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,050
I realized it's all about fate.

194
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,620
If I don't have the fate,

195
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,140
how can it be forced?

196
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,090
Don't worry.

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,810
I know what to do.

198
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,910
From now on,

199
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,740
we will be the best partners on stage

200
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,660
and the best friends off stage.

201
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,810
I have one more thing

202
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,090
to ask for your help.

203
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,150
What is it?

204
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,270
You know

205
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,990
I have always wanted to leave
the Chunshou Troupe.

206
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,910
In a few days,

207
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,450
we will perform in Jiangzhou.

208
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,980
On the stage,

209
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,900
I beg you

210
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,980
to stab me in public.

211
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,050
Use this knife.

212
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,620
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not.

213
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Even if I am, it's because
the leader forced me.

214
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
Keep your voice down.

215
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,980
Listen to me.

216
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,400
I will no longer let Chen Shouting

217
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,450
control my life.

218
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,150
Now,

219
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,550
Jiangzhou is
under Commander Lei's control.

220
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,020
Lei Hai's most favored mistress

221
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,780
was once a star performer on stage.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,310
So this time,

223
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,290
when we perform in Jiangzhou,

224
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,640
Lei Hai will definitely accompany her

225
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,570
to watch the performance.

226
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,560
And on the stage,

227
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,880
if anything goes wrong,

228
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Lei Hai will surely send someone
to investigate it.

229
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,240
Do you want the leader to be disgraced?

230
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,090
Wouldn't that be good?

231
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,480
By then,

232
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,500
we can put all the blame on him.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
If Commander Lei holds him accountable,

234
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,410
Chen Shouting

235
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,740
will not be able to escape.

236
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,020
This way, I can escape from him,

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,330
and you can take control
of the Chunshou Troupe.

238
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,330
Didn't he already sign the document?

239
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,330
If anything happens to him,

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,450
you will take over the Chunshou Troupe.

241
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,690
This way, you, I, and Xiaohe

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
will all be free.

243
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,260
We will all get what we want.

244
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Zhiyuan,

245
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,780
please help me.

246
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,140
The pear soup is here!

247
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
Mr. Cheng,

248
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,090
as per your instructions,

249
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,660
we used the best Cangxi pear.

250
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,270
Thank you.

251
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,210
No problem, you go ahead.

252
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,090
The moment when the poison
was mixed into the pear soup,

253
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,980
you, Uncle Xi, and Du Xiaohe

254
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,810
all knew very well

255
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,780
that Zhao Xuanxue was doomed.

256
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,380
What does it have to do with them?

257
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,720
It's because I couldn't have her,

258
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,740
so I destroyed her.

259
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,930
I have no regrets.

260
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,050
And I have nothing to say.

261
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,620
You have nothing to say,

262
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,680
but I do.

263
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,390
Cheng Zhiyuan,

264
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,840
you said you loved Zhao Xuanxue

265
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,780
and you couldn't get her,

266
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,570
so you destroyed her out of hatred,

267
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,790
right?

268
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,990
Fine.

269
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,380
Dare you to look into Xiaohe's eyes

270
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,690
and say it again?

271
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,720
Sure.

272
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,930
Xiaohe.

273
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,740
I...

274
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,330
Actually, the person you truly love

275
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,930
is not Zhao Xuanxue,

276
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,740
but Du Xiaohe.

277
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,090
Just now, Xiaofan tested you a little

278
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,410
and you got so nervous.

279
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,210
In front of the person you deeply love,

280
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,410
you can't say those words.

281
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,780
She is just my junior sister.

282
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,660
Du Xiaohe,

283
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,690
is it so important to be
a star performer?

284
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,280
So important that you used

285
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,570
Cheng Zhiyuan's love for you

286
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,410
to kill your best friend?

287
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,410
That's a human life!

288
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,750
Moreover,

289
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,500
she stayed in the Chunshou Troupe

290
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,170
because of you.

291
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,050
What are you talking about?

292
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,140
I don't understand.

293
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,270
I said

294
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,540
the person who killed Zhao Xuanxue

295
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,570
is you.

296
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,980
No, it's me.

297
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,190
Don't wrong Xiaohe.

298
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,030
Cheng Zhiyuan,

299
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,450
ask yourself.

300
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,070
Do you really think Du Xiaohe

301
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,050
is right to do this?

302
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,270
Loving someone

303
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,090
doesn't mean to let them have their own ways,

304
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,480
nor does it mean ignoring right
and wrong

305
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,260
to become their slave.

306
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,790
Other people's lives

307
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,210
should never be sacrificed for your love.

308
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,860
Du Xiaohe,

309
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,980
you are so happy

310
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,170
with so many people loving you

311
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,200
and caring for you,

312
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,210
yet you are still not satisfied,

313
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,020
and use them shamelessly.

314
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,560
Cheng Zhiyuan's love for you

315
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,570
is so clear.

316
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,450
Do you think Uncle Xi's love for you

317
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,500
is not clear enough?

318
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,390
Wu Xi,

319
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,860
tell everyone.

320
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,740
What is the relationship

321
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,450
between Du Xiaohe and Uncle Xi?

322
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,500
They are

323
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,880
father and daughter.

324
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,900
