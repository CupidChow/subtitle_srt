2
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,030
Wu Xi,

3
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,490
tell everyone.

4
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,050
What is the relationship

5
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,660
between Du Xiaohe and Uncle Xi?

6
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,830
They are

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
father and daughter.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,300
You're talking nonsense.

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,910
I came to the opera troupe alone.

10
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,910
Where do I get a daughter from?

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,750
I'm not talking nonsense.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,480
Today when Xiaohe went to your room,

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,400
I heard

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,300
what you two talked about.

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,900
(Zhicheng Hall)

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,300
I've told you many times.

17
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,020
As long as you ask,

18
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,690
I'll do anything.

19
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,690
One more step to go.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,410
Just one more step.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,760
I know.

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,660
It has been your dream.

23
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,690
Since you joined the Chunshou Troupe,

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,820
you have never given up.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,660
I saw it with my own eyes.

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,540
But if you do this...

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,500
I don't want to lose you.

28
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,780
Silly girl.

29
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,380
As long as you're happy,

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm willing to do anything.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,760
Father.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,080
Call me one more time, okay?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
Father.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
I...

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,290
The peony flower on your box

36
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,690
was carved

37
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,000
using a very special technique

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,620
in Jianchuan wood carving.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,170
Xiaohe mentioned to Captain Song

40
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,850
that she is from Jianchuan.

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,110
It's not like that.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
No.

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,450
Don't frame Xiaohe.

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,170
Wu Xi, what exactly is your purpose?

45
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,940
It's me, it's me alone.

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,780
I did it.

47
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,990
Don't frame her.

48
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,030
Don't frame her.

49
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,940
Stop crying.

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,080
I just want

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,290
to play Du Liniang for once.

52
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,540
Just once.

53
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,410
Is that wrong?

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,380
There's nothing wrong
with playing Du Liniang.

55
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,670
But you

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,590
used the wrong method.

57
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,270
Zhao Xuanxue desperately

58
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,640
wanted to get rid of it.

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,500
But I can't have it even if I've tried
so hard. Why?

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,660
I joined the troupe earlier than her.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,290
But I can only play Chunxiang.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,840
I worked harder than her

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,150
and sang better than her.

64
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,170
I should be the perfect choice
for this role.

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,280
But I can only

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,940
play the maid.

67
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,130
People saw Zhao Xuanxue,

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,250
praised her and supported her only.

69
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,690
I hate her.

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,400
I hate the leader.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,310
I even hate

72
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,360
the audience there.

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,280
Why can't they

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,010
give me a chance?

75
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,340
Just let me play the role once.

76
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,450
I can make the leader realize

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
that I

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,200
am the star performer

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,150
he has been looking for.

80
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,080
Cheng Zhiyuan helped you
kill Zhao Xuanxue.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,200
You've already had the chance.

82
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,930
Why did you still want to get rid of
Chen Shouting?

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,660
Chance?

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Leader.

85
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,560
What's wrong?

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,610
There is something

87
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,580
I have always wanted to ask you.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Don't say it.

89
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,660
I know what you want to ask.

90
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,610
It's still the same answer.

91
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,200
In this life,

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,700
you can only be Chunxiang.

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,290
If you want to play Du Liniang,

94
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,550
wait for the next life.

95
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,700
- But I...
- What?

96
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,900
You're not convinced?

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,410
Leader, take your medicine first.

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,850
The water will get cold.

99
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,170
It's not good for your stomach.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Leader.

101
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
I...

102
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,900
Are you done yet?

103
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
What's wrong, Leader?

104
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,540
I feel a bit dizzy.

105
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,580
That's right.

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,810
How come...

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,340
Didn't you say

108
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,020
if I want to play Du Liniang,

109
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,700
I have to wait for the next life?

110
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,230
Since in this life,

111
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,410
you can't fulfill my wish,

112
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,700
I can only fulfill it myself.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,610
- What?
- So Leader,

114
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,490
your life

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,370
ends here.

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
You

117
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,050
poisoned me?

118
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,540
What a pity, Leader.

119
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,050
You won't be able to see it.

120
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,700
But it's okay.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,850
In the next life,

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,050
I will play Du Liniang again.

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,340
Then you can regret it.

124
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
I...

125
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,050
I will strangle you.

126
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,780
There is something

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,220
I forgot to tell you.

128
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,220
Zhiyuan

129
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,660
doesn't like Zhao Xuanxue.

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,370
It was all part of my plan.

131
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,000
You don't even know

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,930
who Zhiyuan likes.

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,640
So you really are

134
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,050
blind to the truth.

135
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,220
Oh, my leader.

136
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,970
You dedicated your entire life
to Zhao Xuanxue.

137
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,540
But in the end,

138
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,780
it was all in vain.

139
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,140
But you won't have another chance
to turn things around.

140
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,730
Listen to my advice.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,260
End it yourself.

142
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
Otherwise,

143
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,170
you will suffer more pain.

144
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,220
Do you think

145
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,640
I should kill someone

146
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,580
as blind as him?

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,260
You killed Zhao Xuanxue

148
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,730
because her existence

149
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,790
left you no chance.

150
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,100
You killed Chen Shouting

151
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,730
because he didn't give you a chance.

152
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,070
What about Uncle Xi?

153
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,780
He is your father.

154
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,370
Can you bear to let him
be your scapegoat?

155
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,740
He is my father.

156
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,790
So

157
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,330
he is willing to take the blame for me.

158
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,500
Is there a problem with that?

159
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,290
Don't blame her anymore.

160
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,570
It was all my own choice.

161
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,570
It was all my own choice.

162
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,810
How can you say that?

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,570
Do you still have any human emotions?

164
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,090
Emotions?

165
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,090
What use are they?

166
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,500
You said my father loves me.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,240
But since I was young,

168
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,660
I was never well-fed or warmly clothed.

169
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,690
To survive,

170
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,860
I joined the troupe at a young age.

171
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,050
To practice my skills,

172
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,210
I endured countless beatings.

173
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,410
Chen Shouting was my teacher.

174
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,000
But he never

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,290
liked me.

176
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,270
It was as if

177
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,380
my existence

178
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,050
was only to highlight
his beloved Zhao Xuanxue.

179
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,270
Tell me.

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,570
What else could I do?

181
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,140
Did I want it to be this way?

182
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,620
I could only rely on myself

183
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,660
to fight for what I want.

184
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Xiaohe.

185
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,290
Zhiyuan.

186
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,860
And you.

187
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,960
I understand you.

188
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,810
We've been together for so long.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,740
I have no regrets.

190
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,620
Zhiyuan.

191
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,860
Do I look good today?

192
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,270
You look beautiful.

193
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,510
Then,

194
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,900
would you be willing

195
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,210
to perform The Peony Pavilion with me?

196
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,260
I have been waiting for this moment

197
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,050
for too long.

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,260
Liu Mengmei

199
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,210
cannot lose Du Liniang again.

200
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,500
I know

201
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,050
you are kind-hearted people.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,050
I have spent my whole life

203
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,620
waiting for this day.

204
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,500
Can you give me a chance

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,380
to perform with Zhiyuan

206
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,980
this scene from The Peony Pavilion?

207
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,570
Is that okay?

208
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,810
Sis.

209
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,090
Since you are well-versed
in poetry and literature,

210
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,330
why not compose a poem

211
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,500
to appreciate this willow branch?

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,540
That person is a stranger to me.

213
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:54,330
Why did he come here?

214
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,450
Father.

215
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,210
I also want that rattle drum.

216
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,510
Xiaohe, be good.

217
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,210
I'll buy it for you later.

218
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,620
You always say that,

219
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,330
but you never do it.

220
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,360
Why can't I own the things

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,450
that others have?

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,810
You filthy beggar.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,140
How dare you steal my thing?

224
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
Give it to me.

225
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,290
Give it to me.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,140
Filthy beggar,

227
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,290
give it to me.

228
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,290
You still won't give it to me?

229
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,900
You pushed me?

230
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,270
Father.

231
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,290
We need to change our way of living.

232
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,190
This afternoon,

233
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,120
at the entrance of Yutai Teahouse,

234
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,520
when you went to the restroom

235
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,900
I met someone.

236
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,980
He is from an opera troupe.

237
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,860
I have made an arrangement with him.

238
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,930
I will be his apprentice

239
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,140
and follow him from now on.

240
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,090
Father, don't worry.

241
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,210
I have thought it all through for you.

242
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,210
Once I get a foothold
in the opera troupe,

243
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,270
you can find a reason to come over.

244
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,740
This way, we can be together.

245
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,690
My daughter!

246
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,980
Xiaohe.

247
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,110
Xiaohe.

248
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,410
My daughter.

249
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,030
Take him away.

250
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,990
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,030
Should the poor

252
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,500
be bullied?

253
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,150
Should we kill

254
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,570
because of grievances?

255
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,680
- Go.
- Go.

256
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,140
(Mantangchun Theater)

257
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,190
They are all dead.

258
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,640
From now on, who would dare

259
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,020
to come to this theater for operas?

260
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Indeed.

261
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,540
Desires are truly terrifying.

262
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,150
They can twist a person's heart

263
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,290
so much.

264
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,690
Everyone has desires.

265
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,450
They are like a sleeping tiger

266
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,410
in our hearts.

267
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,810
Once it is awakened,

268
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,140
we will have to engage

269
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,020
in a life-and-death struggle with it.

270
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,540
But the most terrifying thing
is not desires,

271
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,740
but those accomplices

272
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,260
who are willing to sacrifice everything

273
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,260
without considering
the consequences.

274
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,680
They

275
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,260
make the apple rot faster

276
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,390
and more thoroughly.

277
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,620
I don't know about other desires,

278
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,840
but appetite

279
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,270
is absolutely uncontrollable.

280
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,950
Now that the case is closed,

281
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,310
let's go to Jushangfang for a good meal.

282
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,150
My treat.

283
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,080
Okay.

284
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Miss,

285
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,000
the Commander asked me
to get the case result.

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Just tell my father

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,990
that the case is closed and the culprit
has been identified.

288
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,160
We will write a report

289
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,280
to Director Xu

290
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,120
after we go back.

291
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,240
If he wants to know,

292
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,720
he can call Director Xu himself.

293
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Understood.

294
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,020
Miss, that day,

295
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,430
the Third Lady was frightened.

296
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,620
The Commander wants to buy her a gift,

297
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,810
- so...
- Got it.

298
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,630
Yes.

299
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I have handed the autopsy report to Mao.

300
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,570
My father needs me.

301
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,680
We'll meet another day.

302
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,790
Let's go.

303
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,930
Not going home?

304
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,450
What? Are you inviting me to a meal?

305
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Cafeteria.

306
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,500
Can you have some new ideas?

307
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,900
You can choose not to come.

308
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,860
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

309
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,860
I still haven't figured out

310
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,050
the mystery behind this case.

311
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,450
These days, I've been thinking

312
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,160
that this secret force is deliberately trying

313
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,500
to get close to Director Xu.

314
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,140
They won't give up easily.

315
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,500
And we can't face the challenge
passively.

316
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,810
I have been thinking of it for many days,

317
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,860
but I have no idea.

318
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,270
What are your plans?

319
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,330
To be honest, I don't have any.

320
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,600
Let's start by going through the files.

321
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,500
What do you need me to do?

322
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,330
Alright, tell Mao and Chen Zheng

323
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,570
to pay attention to anyone

324
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,780
with this tattoo

325
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,150
while handling cases these days.

326
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,020
If they find anyone, report it immediately.

327
