2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,380
I got kicked again for no reason.

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,850
Why am I always the unlucky one?

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Quick, change into this.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,560
It would be easier to move around

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,730
with this outfit on in the mansion.

7
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,820
(Allegiance to Lei)

8
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,500
Commander, everything is ready.

9
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,920
Commander.

10
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,530
Why are you practicing

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,800
so late at night?

12
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,050
You look as beautiful as you were

13
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,940
with this costume on.

14
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,250
I've aged.

15
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,600
In just a little while,

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,530
I already feel exhausted.

17
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,110
Commander,

18
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,410
it's almost time.

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,800
It's getting late.

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,170
You should rest early.

21
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,860
I still have some work to do.

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Please, Commander.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,010
The Commander has arrived.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Commander.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,920
- Good evening, Commander.
- Good evening, Commander.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,660
- Good evening, Commander.
- Good evening, Commander.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
Commander,

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,290
they are just some ruffians.

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,410
Please don't mind.

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,510
Commander.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,340
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,620
I want to stay with you.

33
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,730
You seem a bit off today.

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,690
What's wrong?

35
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,080
I've heard for a long time

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,990
that there's a treasure vault
in the Governor's Mansion.

37
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,940
I wanted to see

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,460
what treasures there are.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,660
Are you interested in this too?

40
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,410
Commander.

41
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,430
Alright.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,220
Let's go take a look together.

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Commander,

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,570
I think this is inappropriate.

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,480
She is not an outsider.

46
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,730
What's inappropriate about it?

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,550
Let's go.

48
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,660
What are you waiting for?

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,410
Tell your men to follow me.

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,690
Follow the Commander
to broaden your horizons.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,200
Let's see

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,960
what's inside the underground palace.
Let's go.

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,920
- Alright.
- Okay.

54
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go take a look.

55
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,010
Tianlang, darken your face

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,220
and come in with me.

57
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,670
Alright.

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,690
Xiaofan, after we go in,

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,040
gather the trustworthy soldiers

60
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,340
in the Governor's Mansion immediately

61
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,600
and wait at the door to act accordingly.

62
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,230
Please take care

63
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,660
of my father.

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Don't worry.

65
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,270
Why are you doing this?

66
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,780
Don't forget. We are partners.

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
What are those two dawdling about
back there?

68
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
Hurry to follow up.

69
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,390
I'm ready.

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,780
Where are they?

71
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,500
Come on, I've already dressed up.

72
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,940
Isn't this just a waste of effort?

73
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,900
Alright, stop nagging.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,320
Hurry and come with me
to gather the people.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,820
- Yes.
- Okay.

76
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,100
Quite a lot, huh?

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,600
How is it?

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,460
All good stuff, right?

79
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,710
(Lei)

80
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,780
With these,

81
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,390
we can definitely

82
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,840
give that scoundrel Chen Biao a hard time.

83
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,050
He wants to take over Jiangzhou,

84
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,320
but let's see

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,730
if he has the capability.

86
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,750
Commander.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,850
We can start now.

88
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,930
Guys, gather up.

89
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,460
Guys,

90
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,220
you used to follow Master Long,

91
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,630
but now

92
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,580
you're following me.

93
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,590
That's a smart choice.

94
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,610
I'm

95
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,930
a reasonable person.

96
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,830
Since we are in one team now,

97
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,610
we speak as one

98
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,970
and we share blessings and hardships
together.

99
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,020
Now, thank the Commander.

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,100
Thank you, Commander.

101
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,100
Chen Biao is already at our doorstep.

102
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,370
I have come up with a brilliant plan,

103
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,170
but whether it succeeds or not

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,260
depends on you.

105
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,930
Commander, we are simple men.

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,260
Speak plainly.

107
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,480
Alright.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Then I

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,830
won't beat around the bush.

110
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,780
I hope you will become

111
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,780
the vanguards of the Lei's Army

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,100
and launch a surprise attack
on Chen Biao's base.

113
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,120
Vanguards?

114
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,530
Won't we be walking straight to our death?

115
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,000
We're not even a regular army.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,100
Lieutenant Zou, what's the deal here?

117
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,460
Didn't I explain it clearly?

118
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,410
Juta.

119
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
Guys,

120
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,410
did you all hear that?

121
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,560
The Commander

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,510
is sending us to death.

123
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,700
Exactly right!

124
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,140
He wants you to die!

125
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,580
Zou Jing,

126
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,530
what are you trying to do?

127
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,340
This is the armory.

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,020
Be careful not to set off any weapons.

129
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,220
Has Chen Biao bought you off?

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,280
Speak!

131
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,290
I don't want to go to war
with you anymore.

132
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,920
What did you say?

133
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,170
I said I don't want to go to war
with you anymore.

134
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,070
Lei Hai.

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,460
I've had enough.

136
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,220
Because of your greed,

137
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,580
so many soldiers have died.

138
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,670
Commander,

139
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,970
did you even value our lives?

140
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,700
You didn't.

141
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,900
I've had enough of the sound of gunfire.

142
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,390
I've had enough of seeing people

143
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,340
getting shot or blown apart
right in front of me.

144
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,580
I've had enough of dreaming every night

145
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,470
about the people I've killed.

146
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,310
Lei Hai,

147
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
you are already the king of Jiangzhou.

148
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,970
Why are you still not satisfied?

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,100
But now I've figured it out.

150
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,410
As long as you die,

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,970
the Night God will rule Jiangzhou.

152
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,580
and there will be no more wars.

153
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,290
This nightmare

154
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,140
will end, Lei Hai!

155
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,660
Cut him down for me.

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
Go.

157
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,100
Lei Hai,

158
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,170
surrender now.

159
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,390
You hideous man.

160
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
Let her go.

161
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,170
If you have the guts, come at me.

162
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,610
I've had enough of being your dog.

163
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,310
Now,

164
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,020
you have three seconds

165
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,660
to get on your knees.

166
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,370
Or she will die.

167
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,230
Three.

168
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,550
Two.

169
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,780
Wait, I'll kneel.

170
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,140
Commander, don't kneel.

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,260
You are a man of iron will.

172
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,130
You can't kneel to such a traitor.

173
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,540
Commander,

174
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,460
in the next life,

175
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,370
we will still be husband and wife.

176
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
This stone door is too heavy.

177
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,880
We can't push it open.

178
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,560
Come on, we need to think of a way

179
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
to open it quickly.

180
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,010
- Find the open button quickly.
- Yes.

181
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,430
Go.

182
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,540
You go.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,370
You go.

184
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,220
I'm Song He from the detective squad.

185
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,650
If you're not afraid of death,
come at me.

186
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,850
Last time, we didn't settle the score.

187
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,300
This time, let's continue.

188
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,510
Fine.

189
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,610
Today,

190
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,960
we will settle this once and for all.

191
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Juta.

192
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,490
Qin Huole.

193
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,830
Do you really think Commander Lei

194
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,700
would fall for Zou Jing's trap?

195
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,350
Let me tell you.

196
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,890
Today is all a setup

197
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,710
just to confirm

198
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,970
the Commander's suspicions.

199
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Now,

200
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,180
heavy troops are surrounding.

201
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,300
If you surrender and turn to
the right side now,

202
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,010
I can plead with the Commander

203
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,540
to let you go.

204
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,800
What are you standing there for?

205
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,010
These men follow you

206
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,870
to enjoy a good life,

207
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,490
not to follow you to their deaths.

208
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,700
Hurry up and open the door.

209
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,160
Don't move.

210
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,460
Miss Youlan,

211
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,880
I apologize.

212
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,190
Be careful.

213
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,850
Nobody moves.

214
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
Zou Jing.

215
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,770
You really are one of Night God's men.

216
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
Lei Hai.

217
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,850
You're gonna die here tonight.

218
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,460
Juta, don't you always want revenge?

219
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
The person who killed Master Long
is right here.

220
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,970
His name is Ding Mao.

221
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,940
He hypnotized Youlan

222
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,850
to kill Master Long and framed it on me.

223
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
Juta.

224
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,300
You should know who I am.

225
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,920
I can promise you

226
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
with my life

227
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,960
that every word Qin Huole says

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
is true.

229
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,830
Master Long,

230
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,040
Great Master and Master Du

231
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,890
were all killed by him.

232
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,770
They eliminated the three tigers
of Jiangzhou

233
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,820
to control the entire city.

234
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,100
Was it really you?

235
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,830
It was me.

236
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,700
You little brat.

237
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,850
You didn't choose the right way to go.

238
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,950
Today

239
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,180
I will use your life

240
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,890
to honor Master Long's spirit in heaven.

241
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,320
Guys, kill him.

242
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,160
Juta.

243
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,640
Listen to me.

244
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
A wise man submits to circumstances.

245
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,730
Didn't Qin Huole say it?

246
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,970
They follow you

247
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,590
to enjoy a good life,

248
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,700
not to die.

249
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,830
I promise you.

250
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,100
As long as we get through tonight,

251
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,220
Youlong Gambling House,

252
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,540
Huanyinglou,

253
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,710
and Du's Rickshaw Company

254
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,550
will all be yours.

255
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,830
Bah.

256
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,970
He followed me for so many years.

257
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,580
How is he treating me now?

258
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,890
Don't you understand yet?

259
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,970
Tonight in Jiangzhou,

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,770
everything will change.

261
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,010
Deal.

262
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,490
- Mr. Night God.
- Mr. Night God.

263
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,130
Qin Weilian,

264
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,280
you are the Night God?

265
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,120
That's right.

266
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,850
I am Night God.

267
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,250
What do you want to do?

268
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,180
Dominate Jiangzhou.

269
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,180
- Dad.
- Shut up.

270
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,610
I never wanted you to be here.

271
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,180
But you still came.

272
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,300
Are you and your father
in this together?

273
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,730
- No, we're not.
- So you're Xiaofan's good friend.

274
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,920
But they're

275
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,940
a bunch of riffraff.

276
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,650
What else can they do

277
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,850
besides these underhanded tricks?

278
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,700
And you,

279
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,960
you've been with me
for so many years.

280
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,800
How come you haven't improved at all?

281
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,640
What do you know?

282
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,240
Mr. Night God

283
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,180
will create a perfect Jiangzhou.

284
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,700
But there's no need for such a big fuss.

285
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,460
You want to be the commander?

286
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,590
Just tell me.

287
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,960
I'll let you be the commander
for some days.

288
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,920
Let's see if you're capable enough.

289
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,760
Commander?

290
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,460
Do you think I care about this position?

291
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,370
Mr. Night God, don't talk to him
anymore.

292
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,350
Kill him.

293
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,340
Before you die,

294
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,580
do something for me.

295
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,370
Let's hear it.

296
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,430
Uncle Fu.

297
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,300
The Self-Condemnation Edict.

298
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,610
I am Lei Hai.

299
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
Since I led the Lei's Army

300
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,580
to take over Jiangzhou,

301
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,060
I have been extorting

302
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,250
and plundering money by force.

303
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,920
People's life has deteriorated,

304
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,160
and there's devastation everywhere.

305
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,180
This is truly a great misfortune
for Jiangzhou.

306
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,680
Recently, I was shocked to hear

307
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,130
that Chen Biao's army was coming from Yunnan.

308
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,730
I fear so much of that.

309
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,890
Moreover,

310
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,420
he listened to a sorcerer's fallacy,

311
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,540
and in order to permanently
occupy Jiangzhou,

312
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,490
he took the dike as a jinx.

313
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,890
So he blew it up

314
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,340
and flooded the city.

315
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,320
Such heinous crimes
are beyond description,

316
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,250
and cannot be fully recorded.

317
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,940
You dare not beg for the forgiveness

318
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,610
of the people of Jiangzhou,

319
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,700
so you are willing to step down.

320
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,540
The Lei's Army will also follow his orders

321
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
without defiance.

322
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,540
What Self-Condemnation Edict?

323
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,060
I'll admit to the first part,

324
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,870
but if you say I blew up the river dike,

325
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,890
I didn't do it

326
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,580
and I have never thought about it.

327
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,800
Even if you kill me,

328
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,940
I won't admit it.

329
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,650
If you don't admit it,

330
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,830
how could the people of Jiangzhou

331
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,610
hate you so much?

332
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,940
I finally understand.

333
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,100
You played a trick on me,

334
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,610
a heart-striking one.

335
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,860
