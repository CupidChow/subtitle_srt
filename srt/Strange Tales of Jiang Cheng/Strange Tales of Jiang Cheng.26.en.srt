=Episode 26=

2
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,820
(Jushangfang)

3
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,980
(Jushangfang has reopened.)

4
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,780
(Jushangfang)

5
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,340
- Captain Song.
- Miss Qingyao.

6
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,100
I am here to meet Zhuang Si
of Zhuang's Trading Company.

7
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,110
Could you please show me the way?

8
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,580
Mr. Zhuang is on the second floor.

9
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,780
But Captain Song,

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,500
it might not be a good time

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,340
for you to see him now.

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,660
Then I'll go by myself.

13
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,140
Why are you here? For investigation?

14
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,300
Is Commander Lei in?

15
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,940
Yes. I've heard about
the murder at Huanyinglou.

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,820
But the commander is meeting Mr. Zhuang.

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,860
No one is allowed to get in.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,260
If you want to find Mr. Zhuang,

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
wait until the commander leaves.

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,420
Alright.

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,500
Sit.

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,180
Commander Lei, I'm Song He. I...

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,460
What are you doing?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,380
Your temper will get you killed someday.

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,340
Do you know that?

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,500
Sorry, sorry, bro.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,620
I really have no choice.

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,060
The case can't be delayed
even for a moment.

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,380
Commander Lei, it's me, Song He.

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,740
- I need to go in.
- Stop arguing.

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,260
Let him in.

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,740
Commander.

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,460
What are you shouting for?

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,780
Sorry, Commander.

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,900
I came to see him.

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,700
Commander, Captain Song
is here to see me.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,820
Please allow me to have a word with him.

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,100
Then we can continue drinking.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,020
Okay.

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,500
Captain Song, right?

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,540
Nice to meet you.

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,380
- Come on, a toast to you.
- Mr. Zhuang.

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,940
You should know why I'm here to see you.

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,140
On the night of the 18th,

45
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,820
you brought a man to Huanyinglou.

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,380
Then, you had a big argument

47
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,340
over opium trafficking

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,460
with the victim Xu Shenxing

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,620
in the room.

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,260
After that, you left Huanyinglou.

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,660
But that person did not leave.

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,500
A few hours later,

53
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,220
Xu Shenxing was killed.

54
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,260
I didn't kill Shenxing.

55
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,980
I didn't say you killed him.

56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,940
How much did you pay
to hire that person?

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,180
I didn't bring anyone

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,460
to Huanyinglou.

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,660
I'll ask you again.

60
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,100
How much did you pay

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,420
to hire the killer?

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,460
Since we can find out

63
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,300
your relationship,

64
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,940
I can definitely find him.

65
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,460
Mr. Zhuang,

66
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,100
if you suddenly recall something,

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,620
you can come to find me
at the detective squad.

68
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,420
If you don't want to come,

69
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,100
after we find him,

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,820
we'll come to Zhuang's Trading Company
to invite you.

71
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,260
But you should think it through.

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,100
The former is to turn yourself in

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,540
but the latter is that we go to
arrest a suspect.

74
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,580
Which one is severe,

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,340
you should consider it carefully.

76
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
Wait a minute.

77
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,540
Captain Song,

78
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,260
if I'm involved

79
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,700
into opium trafficking,

80
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,180
what would you do?

81
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,500
Act according to the law.

82
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,180
Even if I have to risk my life,

83
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,580
I will stop you.

84
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,700
Good boy, you have guts.

85
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,420
I am the most reasonable man.

86
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,020
Let me tell you this.

87
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,140
As long as I am in Jiangzhou,

88
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,540
I will never allow opium

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,940
to appear on the streets in Jiangzhou.

90
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,340
Mr. Zhuang, did you hear

91
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,980
what I said clearly?

92
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,340
I will strictly follow your instructions.

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,420
Captain Song,

94
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,220
can I now discuss with Mr. Zhuang

95
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,380
how to revitalize

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,540
the commerce of Jiangzhou?

97
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,740
Yes, Commander.

98
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,700
Go to the southern suburbs, please.

99
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,900
Sir, I don't think it's the right way.

100
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,500
It's you.

101
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,180
Last time you met Zou Jin.

102
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,940
(Cheng Tianlang, thief )
You were really lucky.

103
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,860
Today,

104
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,780
I'll get even with you.

105
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,140
Can you stop using a knife?

106
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,180
Isn't the chocolate good?

107
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,060
Shut up.

108
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,260
I will never be fooled by you again.

109
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,860
I will not spare you.

110
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,660
Don't mention chocolate.

111
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,620
Even if you put a hundred silver dollars

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,460
in front of me right now,

113
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,420
I'll still break your arm.

114
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,460
How about this?

115
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,420
Give me half a year and I guarantee

116
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,100
I'll pay you back in full.

117
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,060
Half a year?

118
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,700
Half a year is over 180 days.

119
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,340
That means every day...

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
One hundred and eighty...

121
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,380
Are you trying to fool me again?

122
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,800
No, I'm not.

123
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,580
I'll break your arm today,

124
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,740
and after half a year,

125
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,300
I'll tear you into pieces.

126
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,060
Committing crimesin broad daylight?

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,940
You've got some nerve.

128
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,580
Mind your own business.

129
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,420
Who is this?

130
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,060
Captain Song.

131
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,900
I am Gu Sui from Huanyinglou.

132
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,700
I had a brief encounter

133
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,020
with Mr. Xu.

134
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,420
Thanks to his recommendation,

135
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,700
Huanyinglou hired me as a guard.

136
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,340
Now that he was murdered,

137
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,580
I was wondering

138
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,500
if I could do something for him.

139
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,820
So you went to find Huanyang?

140
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,060
Yes, when Officer Mao

141
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,900
found me,

142
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,540
I immediately recognized that the doll

143
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,580
belonged to Huanyang.

144
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,020
So I wanted to find her

145
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,260
and ask her

146
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,780
what exactly happened.

147
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,980
What exactly happened

148
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,460
between Huanyang

149
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,780
and Xu Shenxing?

150
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,460
Everyone in Jiangzhou knows

151
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,260
Xu Shenxing

152
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,260
is Director Xu's son.

153
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,820
He was born with good looks

154
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,860
and was a charming playboy.

155
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,020
Moreover,

156
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,220
how could the son of the director
of the police station

157
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,580
marry a singer as his wife?

158
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,820
But somehow, Huanyang managed

159
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,420
to enchant Mr. Xu.

160
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,220
Ever since Miss Huanyang

161
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,100
came to Huanyinglou,

162
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,740
he spent almost every day

163
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,100
with Miss Huanyang.

164
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,780
He even promised

165
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,660
to bring her into his residence.

166
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,780
If you

167
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,860
marry into the Xu Residence,

168
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,220
don't forget about me.

169
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,540
Among you girls,

170
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
I care the most

171
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,860
about you.

172
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,500
I never expected that you would be

173
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,020
the first one to leave.

174
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,740
I fully understand

175
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,220
that without your matchmaking,

176
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,820
(Huanyang, singing girl of Huanyinglou)
Shenxing and I wouldn't be together.

177
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,780
I can never repay

178
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,940
your kindness in my lifetime.

179
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,460
That's good.

180
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,060
That's good.

181
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,100
Keep dressing up yourself.

182
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,580
You will marry into the Xu Residence
as a beautiful girl.

183
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,820
Gu Sui, go and check.

184
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,420
Mr. Xu will be here soon.

185
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,100
But who is Mr. Xu?

186
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,740
(Huanyinglou)
The famous playboy in Jiangzhou.

187
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,020
So, did you see Shenxing?

188
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm asking you.

189
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,500
I saw him.

190
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,260
Then why hasn't he come yet?

191
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,380
Mr. Xu won't be coming.

192
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
What do you mean?

193
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,820
A new brothel has opened
in the north of the city.

194
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,100
Its top lady Little Anu

195
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
has kept Mr. Xu there.

196
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,380
Though Miss Huanyang

197
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,500
was waiting with her sincere heart,

198
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,620
Mr. Xu didn't show up.

199
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
She was unwilling to accept it,

200
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,540
and went off the track.

201
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,020
What did she do?

202
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,640
Miss Huanyang is not
from the Han nationality.

203
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,380
She is a foreigner
born beyond the Shanhai Pass.

204
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,260
Her people

205
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,740
are skilled in playing the Gayageum.

206
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,540
The melodies are extremely beautiful.

207
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,740
Mr. Xu was attracted by this music

208
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,620
and gradually fell for Miss Huanyang.

209
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,900
Later, through the Madam's arrangement,

210
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,220
he intended to marry Miss Huanyang.

211
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,940
But

212
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,980
Mr. Xu did not know

213
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,380
that the instrument had another use.

214
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
What use?

215
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,940
Badger enchantment.

216
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,700
What's wrong?

217
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,900
The badger enchantment

218
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,380
is nothing but putting food

219
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,060
in the bowl to feed badgers.

220
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,940
It's just a trick.

221
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,580
This is the place.

222
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,100
After the badger enchantment

223
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,940
occurred,

224
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
the girls spread the story
throughout Jiangzhou.

225
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,580
Mr. Xu never came again.

226
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,860
This made Madam Rong very angry.

227
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,260
So she ordered me to expel Huanyang,

228
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,420
and only gave her five silver dollars.

229
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,060
Miss Huanyang pleaded repeatedly.

230
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,380
Madam Rong finally agreed

231
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,900
she could take the Gayageum with her.

232
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,460
Since then,

233
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,660
she has been here all the time?

234
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,500
Yes.

235
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,220
No one in Jiangzhou

236
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,060
dared to take her in.

237
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,820
So I helped her rent this old house.

238
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,060
She has been living here ever since.

239
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Did Xu Shenxing

240
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,820
really never look for her again?

241
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,660
No.

242
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,980
Mr. Xu

243
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,140
never mentioned Huanyang again.

244
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,980
Gu Sui is more skilled than you.
Let him go.

245
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,990
Let's go inside and take a look.

246
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,060
Hey...

247
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
Gu Sui is back.

248
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,260
How is it?

249
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,340
I lost him.

250
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
Could it be Cheng Tianlang?

251
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,980
No, it's not him.

252
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,300
This person is more skilled
than an ordinary thief.

253
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,510
By the way,

254
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
did you find anything?

255
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,460
Judging by the burning incense sticks,

256
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,300
they should have been lit just now.

257
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,860
But from the unfinished writing

258
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,300
on the yellow paper talisman

259
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,420
and the brush pen placed
on the inkstone,

260
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,660
it seems that Miss Huanyang

261
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,340
has left for a long time.

262
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,620
The incense sticks

263
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,340
were probably lit by that person just now.

264
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,780
The purpose was

265
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,340
to create a sight obstruction for us,

266
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,660
making it easier for him
to assassinate one of us.

267
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,260
Are you saying

268
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,180
that he wants to kill one of us?

269
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,680
