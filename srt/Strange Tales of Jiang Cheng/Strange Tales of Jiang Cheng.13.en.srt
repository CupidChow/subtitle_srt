=Episode 13=

2
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,860
(Panlong Hill)

3
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,260
(Yu Rongshui's Grave)

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,020
The murderer used Che Jingwen's death
to set up a trap

5
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,460
and lure us here to save someone.

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,130
There must be another plan.

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,020
This chaotic burial ground

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,490
has a very complex terrain.

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,970
We are in the open.

10
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,390
If something happens,

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,460
you must stay calm.

12
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,470
It's okay.

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,390
It's a bat.

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
Don't move.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,360
Detective Qin.

16
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,380
Where are you rushing off to?

17
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,780
I was wondering who it was.

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,150
Isn't this Cheng Tianlang,

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,620
the train thief?

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,380
No stealing anymore?

21
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,660
You rob now?

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,620
Seeking revenge.

23
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,120
It's an open robbery.

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,010
No need for excuses.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,060
(Cheng Tianlang, thief)

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,900
Let me tell you, Qin Huole.

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,840
Don't think that just because you hid
in the police station,

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,970
I won't dare to touch you.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,250
I thought

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,410
the animosity between us
hadn't reached to be hatred.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
You should hate Captain Song.

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,590
After all, he beat and arrested you.

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
Between us,

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,900
it's at most a misunderstanding.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
How about this?

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,240
You can pick a few items

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,150
from the backpack

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,640
as compensation for your loss.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,480
Okay?

40
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,820
Don't mess around.
My knife doesn't have eyes.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,590
I'll find something for you.

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,430
Or you can do it yourself.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,430
This is a flashlight

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,270
for illumination.

45
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,240
That's a magnifying glass.

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
It's useless to you.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
That one is good.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,250
Yes, this one.

49
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,550
Chocolate.

50
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,570
Chocolate?

51
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,730
- What's it for?
- Snack.

52
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,870
Try it.

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,310
What's wrong?

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,570
You're so timid now.

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
Timid?

56
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,540
The word "timid" doesn't exist
in my dictionary.

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,010
Chocolate.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,480
How does it taste?

59
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,170
Sweet.

60
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
Do you like it?

61
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll get you a few more pieces.

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,380
Take a few more.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,660
Qin Huole!

64
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,100
Qin Huole!

65
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
Stop!

66
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,170
Qin Huole!

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,490
Qin Huole!

68
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,000
- Lieutenant Zou.
- Qin Huole?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm being robbed.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,100
Qin Huole!

71
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,140
Qin Huole!

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,870
Luckily, I met you today.

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,400
Otherwise, there would have been
big trouble.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,020
It's okay. Since he has run away,

75
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,100
I will take my leave now.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,280
Wait a moment.

77
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,510
Lieutenant Zou.

78
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,200
Today, I might need you to give me a ride.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,020
We are investigating a case.
Xiaofan is in danger.

80
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,930
I circled back here again.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,540
This is called Ghost Wall.

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
What?

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,220
They have already gone to Panlong Hill?

84
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,710
Wait, wait!

85
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,550
Hai, Hai!

86
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,510
Lieutenant Zou.

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,030
You are the closest confidant

88
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,150
of Commander Lei

89
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,170
and the most promising young talent
of Lei's Army.

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
It's a great honor to meet you today.

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,020
I am truly fortunate.

92
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,580
(The Death Lantern)
These are for you.

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,420
(To Lieutenant Zou Jing.
Presented by Huo Qingxin.)

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,930
The other copy is for Commander Lei.

95
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,960
Thank you.

96
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,850
Please convey my regards
to Commander Lei.

97
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,310
Take care.

98
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
Hai.

99
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,220
I don't know

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,100
what kind of luckI've had recently.

101
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,790
I even managed to make connections

102
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,660
with the closest confidant
of Commander Lei.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
Nice.

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,780
Wonderful.

105
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,700
(To Lieutenant Zou Jing.)
Lieutenant Zou, faster.

106
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,110
Okay.

107
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,140
I have a question.

108
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,920
Why do you trust

109
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,320
what Huo Qingxin said just now?

110
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,880
Maybe the Parrot Tomb he wrote about
in the book

111
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,020
is not Panlong Hill.

112
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,870
It has to be.

113
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,100
If I went alone,

114
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,220
there might be such a possibility.

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,480
But with you here,

116
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,460
such a thing will not happen.

117
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm not flattering you.

118
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,790
A famous Austrian psychologist

119
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,080
called Freud once said

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,920
that any action of a person

121
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,290
ultimately is not done without reason.

122
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,480
When I saw the handwriting
Huo Qingxin left in the book,

123
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
you will understand.

124
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,030
It shows humility in its neatness,

125
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,220
and is with a sense of reverence.

126
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,490
So how could he possibly lie to you?

127
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,670
Don't you believe it?

128
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,100
Look at his usual signature.

129
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,520
(Huo Qingxin)
It's flamboyant and cursive.

130
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,580
It's unrecognizable.

131
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,240
Look.

132
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,170
It's a new grave.

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,220
Indeed, it's a new grave.

134
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,630
But...

135
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,070
But what?

136
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
Look.

137
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,230
This paper money

138
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,260
is soaked by rain.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,470
Dew couldn't have

140
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,460
dampened it so much.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,350
The last time it rained in Jiangzhou

142
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,410
was seven or eight days ago.

143
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,320
This means this grave

144
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,900
was made at least
seven or eight days ago.

145
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,760
Being buried in here,

146
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,900
not to mention seven or eight days,

147
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,610
even seven or eight hours
would be fatal.

148
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,810
Let's go check other places.

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Song He.

150
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,930
Song He, what's wrong?

151
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,140
Wake up, Song He.

152
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,140
It's corpse miasma.

153
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,810
The medical book says

154
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,100
corpse miasma is hard to disperse.

155
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,520
It invades the skin and tissues

156
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,000
and causes abdominal swelling and toxicity.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,090
Even immortals can't save you then.

158
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,170
(What should I do?)

159
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
(Why am I okay?)

160
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,620
(The effects and uses of mugwort.)

161
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,900
(It can repel moisture and miasma.)

162
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
(It's mugwort!)

163
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,910
(The mugwort pouch my father gave me
to ward off evil)

164
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,810
(is actually useful.)

165
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,150
(Mugwort likes moisture.)

166
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,090
(There must be some nearby.)

167
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,210
What should we do, Lieutenant Zou?

168
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,570
The car definitely can't go through.

169
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,510
Run.

170
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,790
Run.

171
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,990
Song He.

172
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,410
Wake up, Song He.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Song He.

174
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Song He.

175
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,910
Song He.

176
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,870
Come on.

177
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,030
Get up.

178
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Slowly.

179
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,990
How are you feeling?

180
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,240
Feeling better?

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,540
What happened?

182
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,050
It's corpse miasma.

183
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
You fainted.

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,140
Corpse miasma?

185
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,790
Song He.

186
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,150
- Miss Fan!
- Xiaofan!

187
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,260
It's Huole and Zou Jing.

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,880
I brought them here.

189
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,860
You rest here for a while.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,570
Miss Fan!

191
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,810
Song He!

192
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,790
Miss Fan!

193
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,020
- Huole, Zou Jing.
- Xiaofan.

194
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,720
Why are you here?

195
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
- It's a long story.
- Where is Song He?

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,120
We just ran into corpse miasma.

197
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,430
He fainted and just woke up.

198
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,660
He's inside. Let's go.

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
Is there anyone down there?

200
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,320
There really is someone.

201
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,790
Wait a moment.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Song He.

203
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,900
Someone is down there. Come and help me.

204
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Wait.

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Don't rush.

206
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,070
This could be a trap set by the murderer.

207
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,380
- A trap?
- Yes.

208
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
What time is it?

209
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,110
7:58 p.m.

210
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,950
No, there's no time.

211
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,380
Even if it's a trap, we have to try.

212
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,900
But in Xuanyuan Living Corpse,

213
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,000
Detective Cheng Sen

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,950
fell into the murderer's trap

215
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,310
due to limited time.

216
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,450
This might be a hint from the murderer.

217
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,620
But we can't just do nothing.

218
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,330
I think Song He is right.

219
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,390
I just don't believe

220
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,290
that he can play any tricks
while we're here.

221
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,140
Saving the person is the priority.

222
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,030
Let's go.

223
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,630
Move quickly.

224
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
Run!

225
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,360
Newspaper! Newspaper!

226
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,090
The Death Lantern remains unsolved.

227
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,090
Xuanyuan Living Corpse occurs.

228
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,360
Another novel murder case.

229
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Newspaper! Newspaper!

230
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,910
The Death Lantern remains unsolved.

231
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,720
Xuanyuan Living Corpse occurs.

232
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,260
Another novel murder case.

233
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,050
The victim's name is Han Da.

234
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,260
He was the manager of a tea house.

235
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Upon investigation,

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,860
he had no interactions

237
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,330
with Che Jingwen.

238
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,500
From last night until now, I've been thinking

239
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,050
if I had chosen to believe you,

240
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,540
would he still be alive?

241
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,740
The murderer had it all planned out.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,240
He knows us better

243
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,290
than we think.

244
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,750
Listen to me.

245
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,120
If there are things

246
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,450
you don't reconcile with yourself,

247
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,450
they will become

248
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,930
your perpetual burden.

249
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,710
This is what I found

250
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,550
in the victim's stomach.

251
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,380
Have you figured out
the cause of the explosion?

252
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
I detected wine, saltpeter,

253
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,380
and sulfur powder on the body.

254
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,090
The bottle hanging on the wooden board

255
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,690
should contain wine inside.

256
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,140
During the fermentation of grapes,

257
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,740
sugar will convert into alcohol,

258
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,780
and then produce a large amount of gas.

259
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,640
When gas collects

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,620
in the sealed bottle,

261
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,900
pressure increases.

262
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,150
At this moment,

263
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
with external force applied,

264
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,810
it will explode

265
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,640
and react with the sulfur powder

266
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,260
and saltpeter on the victim.

267
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,440
This

268
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,050
is the cause of the explosion.

269
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,140
The third target

270
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,690
will die at 6 p.m. on April 20th.

271
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,740
I couldn't extinguish that flame.

272
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,170
Reading Xuanyuan Living Corpse
won't help either.
