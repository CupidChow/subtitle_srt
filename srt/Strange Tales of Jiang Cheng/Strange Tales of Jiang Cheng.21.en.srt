=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 21=

2
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,260
Isn't this the magic lock?

3
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,990
Magic lock?

4
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,520
Hunters in Jiangzhou

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,470
use it to capture lynxes.

6
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,310
It's very useful.

7
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,330
Before I started to work for Mr. He,

8
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,820
I was repairing temples
in the mountains.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,770
I once saw a hunter

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,380
tie this kind of knot.

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,490
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,490
Young Master.

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,150
He...

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,000
You'll get used to it.

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,490
Why are you asking about this?

16
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,050
Because I want to figure out

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,890
what happened to the three brothers

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,400
after you had a skirmish

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,380
with them.

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,220
If I can reconstruct this part,

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,520
perhaps

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,470
I can deduce the reason for their comeback.

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,060
(The three brothers)

24
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,220
At that time,

25
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,580
we were patrolling this area.

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,060
After hearing gunshots,

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,020
we chased after them.

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,340
The three brothers then

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,900
(The three brothers)
continued to flee upstream.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,020
We exchanged fire midway.

31
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,940
One of them got injured,

32
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,860
and then they jumped into the river

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,160
and swam along the current

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,020
to this bay.

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,780
What's this place called?

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,860
Green Bay.

37
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,900
Turn ahead
and we can see the phone booth.

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,020
Captain, it's right there.

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,580
Come back.

40
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,020
What's wrong?

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,500
Everyone

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,420
has their own mental safe zone.

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,180
Criminals are no different.

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,340
If the three brothers

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,820
consider this area safe,

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,580
their hiding spot

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,540
won't be far away.

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,340
Perhaps

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,900
at this very moment,

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,780
their eyes are fixed on us.

51
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,860
If you get out of the car so recklessly,

52
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,620
you will alert them.

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,380
Captain,

54
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,020
you are

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,980
just like Detective Qin now.

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Come, look here.

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,100
(Jiuju Alley)
Search the area

58
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,780
three kilometers from the telephone booth.

59
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
No, five kilometers.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,260
Grid by grid.

61
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,340
Focus your attention

62
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,060
on bunkers, warehouses,

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,700
and those residential houses
far from the crowd.

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,020
We must find them.

65
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,020
(Temple of Guan Yu)

66
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,100
What are you doing?

67
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,980
The child is thirsty.

68
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,300
I'll pour her a bowl of water.

69
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
No.

70
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,620
Come on, brother.

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,720
She's

72
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,060
just a kid.

73
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,700
Brother, Brother.

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,100
When our parents were killed,

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,820
we were also kids.

76
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,580
Did anyone care about us?

77
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,980
Wu Yi.

78
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,020
Where are you going?

79
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,900
Brother,

80
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,660
I think that young man surnamed Qin

81
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,500
is right.

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,660
Think about it,

83
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,060
the greatest pain

84
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,700
is to let He Lingyu know

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,020
he can still save his daughter, isn't it?

86
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,460
Then we can...

87
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,300
So, Brother,

88
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,460
she must live well.

89
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,620
Xiaofan.

90
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,980
- Mr. He.
- Xiaofan.

91
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,060
Are you starving?

92
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,020
No.

93
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,220
I had Mrs. Qin make

94
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,580
some of your favorite snacks.

95
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,260
Come, have some.

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,060
Here, Mrs. Qin.

97
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,460
Sit down quickly.

98
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,180
- Thank you, Mr. He.
- You're welcome. Eat up.

99
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,260
Miss Xiaofan, you didn't eat much
at dinner.

100
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,020
Have some soup. Don't starve yourself.

101
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,260
This soup still tastes the same.

102
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,300
Mrs. Qin,

103
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,020
your cooking skills have always been
so good.

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,500
You always love the soup

105
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,980
and the hometown snacks I make.

106
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,260
Yes.

107
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,740
I used to be very close with Yinyin.

108
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,780
I came here to play with her often.

109
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Mr. He,

110
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,900
don't worry.

111
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,460
This time, we will definitely
bring Niannian back.

112
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,220
I believe you.

113
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,780
Quick, eat up.

114
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,220
Okay.

115
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,340
By the way,

116
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,180
I have a question to ask.

117
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,420
Just now in this room,

118
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,980
I heard some strange sounds.

119
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,620
It's like the sound of running water.

120
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,540
Right under here.

121
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,620
There's a culvert underground.

122
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,620
During the Westernization Movement,

123
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,540
it's recommended to learn
from foreigners, remember?

124
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,020
The then governor of Jiangzhou
was quite trendy.

125
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,700
He built a Western

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
underground drainage system.

127
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,700
However,

128
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,620
Jiangzhou was caught in frequent wars.

129
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,460
In the end, this system

130
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,180
was completely abandoned.

131
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,580
But I think,

132
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,980
having a governor with such foresight

133
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
is a blessing for Jiangzhou.

134
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,140
By the way,

135
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,380
this trendy governor

136
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,540
did teach a good student.

137
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,620
He is Detective Qin's father.

138
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,940
Lawyer Qin Weilian.

139
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,860
(General Office)

140
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,140
Detective Qin.

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,380
It's okay, Chen. I'll pick it up.

142
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,500
I'll pick it up.

143
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,980
Thank you, Detective Qin.

144
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,340
(Bandits Zhen Jianglong and Zhan Ruhua
were both brought to justice.)

145
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,460
When did you arrive?

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
Any new findings?

147
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,340
Do you have any new findings?

148
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,900
Not at the moment.

149
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,180
Mao, Chen, and I

150
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,020
pulled an all-nighter.

151
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,900
I just let them take a nap.

152
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,100
We plan to expand the search range later.

153
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,620
Captain, you've been busy all night.

154
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,580
Have something to eat.

155
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,300
Water, water.

156
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,780
Who bought these buns?

157
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
Detective Qin bought them.

158
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,740
They smell so good.

159
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,180
No wonder they choke.

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,580
I think you're choking
because you're not fully awake.

161
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,340
Come on, I'll take you somewhere

162
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,340
to help you wake up.

163
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,660
Captain.

164
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,700
Should we continue...

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,540
Didn't you see
Detective Qin's expression?

166
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,300
It means he has already found it.

167
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,700
We don't need to search anymore.

168
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,540
Right, Detective Qin?

169
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,820
Mao.

170
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,660
Continue searching the suspicious areas

171
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,180
near the phone booth.

172
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,820
Yes, sir.

173
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,700
Chen, join him.

174
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,180
Yes, sir.

175
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,460
So your way to help me wake up

176
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,780
is to take a boat trip?

177
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,980
If my guess is right,

178
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,060
this should be a map

179
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,900
drawn by Director Xu.

180
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,420
You want to reconstruct
what happened to the three brothers

181
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,460
after they fled seven years ago,

182
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,220
and find out why they come back.

183
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,540
Amazing, Dr. Fan.

184
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,500
Can you stop being mysterious?

185
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,460
Just tell me your plan.

186
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,380
Sir.

187
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,540
Row over there.

188
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,460
Okay.

189
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,140
(Green Bay Pier)

190
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,780
Ma'am, can I ask you something?

191
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,900
What?

192
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,540
What are you looking at?

193
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,300
Isn't this...

194
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,580
Sir.

195
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,060
Sir.

196
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,940
(Temple of Guan Yu)

197
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,860
You two, go and check over there.

198
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

199
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,500
Let's go.

200
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,380
I can't go on. I need a break.

201
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,940
You know, the Captain just said

202
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,820
to expand the search.

203
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,220
I've run my legs off.

204
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,500
I really can't run anymore.

205
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,500
Look carefully and closely.

206
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,940
These three horrid men.

207
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,540
When I catch them, I won't let them off.

208
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,120
Shh.

209
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Mao, did you hear anything?

210
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,820
There's no sound at all.

211
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,020
Are you still half asleep?

212
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,060
You're being paranoid.

213
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,580
Are you just bored?

214
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,140
Can anyone hide down here?

215
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Is this something

216
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,220
that can be dug out in a day or two?

217
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,940
Do you think those three brothers
are so capable?

218
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,100
Stop talking nonsense and come help.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,620
I ate too many of Detective Qin's buns
this morning.

220
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,700
I need some exercise.

221
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,540
Come and help me.

222
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
One, two, three.

223
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,780
One, two, three.

224
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,460
- Stop.
- Stop.

225
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,060
Wu Bing,

226
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,180
go check up there.

227
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,420
- Go.
- Let go of me.

228
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,700
(Temple of Guan Yu)

229
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,540
What's going on?

230
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Come, take a look.

231
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,260
It's just a petty thief.

232
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,100
I thought they caught
those three brothers.

233
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
It's not that easy.

234
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,500
Take him away.

235
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,780
- Go.
- Go.

236
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,100
(Temple of Guan Yu)

237
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,100
Sir.

238
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,420
Are you the only one at home?

239
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,980
Sir, who tied this knot?

240
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,460
What happened?

241
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,660
Someone got killed.

242
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,900
At the crime scene,

243
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,340
this kind of magic lock appeared.

244
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,460
Sir.

245
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,780
This concerns a child's life.

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,620
This knot was tied by my son.

247
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,180
You should have three sons, right?

248
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,940
Seven years ago,

249
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,900
three kidnappers were caught in a crossfire

250
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,260
with a patrol team

251
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,940
and fled towards Green Bay.

252
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,220
Later,

253
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,820
the police dispatched a large force

254
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
to search nearby,

255
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,620
but they found nothing.

256
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,100
I think,

257
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,260
you must have helped them.

258
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,700
Are they really your children?

259
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,380
What happened exactly?
