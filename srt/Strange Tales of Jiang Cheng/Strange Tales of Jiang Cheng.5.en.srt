=Episode 5=

2
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,850
Move aside.

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,740
Lieutenant Zou, where is my father?

4
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
Commander!

5
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,810
- The commander is fine!
- The commander is fine!

6
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,250
Xiaofan, I'm fine

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,580
Look, I'm perfectly okay.

8
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,530
Dad!

9
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,670
- Are you alright?
- Are you alright?

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,890
You scared me to death.

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
- Silly girl.
- It's okay.

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,520
I have been fighting on the battlefield
for so many years

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,690
What kind of situation haven't I seen?

14
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,020
How could I possibly fail
in this small ditch?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,480
You never mentioned Xiaofan...

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
Commander Lei's daughter.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,720
You never asked.

18
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,750
It's okay.

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,170
No wonder Ma Xiaonian
kept looking for her.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,220
So it was to take revenge
on Commander Lei.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait a minute.

22
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,500
Why does she have the surname Fan?

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,300
During my father's retreat
after a defeat,

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,140
my mother sacrificed herself

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
to save him.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,660
To commemorate her,

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,740
my father let me take her surname.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,690
Her name was Fan Ruoshui.

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,960
I just stepped on a booby trap
he left behind.

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,990
Luckily, I have a strong fate.

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,380
The mine was a dud.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
No.

33
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,950
It wasn't a dud.

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,310
It was delayed.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,330
He was deliberately toying with you.

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,940
(Governor's Mansion)

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
Commander.

38
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,830
I brought him in.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
Commander.

40
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,550
Director Xu.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,530
How does your police station work?

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,240
If something had happened to Commander,

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,440
Could you bear the responsibility?

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,060
Yes, yes.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,700
I failed in my duty.
Commander, please calm down.

46
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,900
I almost got blown up today.

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,700
How do you expect me to calm down?

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,940
I assure you

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,180
(Xu Wuwen: Director of police station)
We will catch the culprit soon,

50
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,700
and give you an explanation.

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,820
How soon is it?

52
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,380
- Seven days.
- What?

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,460
Five days.

54
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,300
How many?

55
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,380
Three days!

56
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,980
I guarantee it with my head.

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,900
Within three days,
we will definitely catch the culprit.

58
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,980
I am always reasonable.

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,740
So three days it is.

60
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,980
If you can't catch the culprit
in three days,

61
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,620
I will remove you from your position.

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,060
- And then,
- Commander,

63
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
I will shoot you.

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,140
I will do my utmost.

65
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Get out!

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,820
- Get out!
- Yes.

67
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,500
Commander.

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,820
Thanks to Qin Huole this time,

69
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,780
who risked his life to warn us,

70
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,700
you can be safe.

71
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,680
Here, have some coffee.

72
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,620
Mr. Qin,

73
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,020
thank you for saving my father yesterday.

74
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
It was nothing.

75
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,900
My father asked me to thank you

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,980
and to invite you to my home

77
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,820
when you're available.

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,020
Forget it.

79
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm afraid your father will point a gun
at me again.

80
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,900
With me around, would he dare?

81
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,540
Xiaofan.

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,580
Captain Song, come quickly.

83
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,700
You came just in time.

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,420
The coffee is freshly brewed.

85
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,500
Sit, sit.

86
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,420
What did the director want with you?

87
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,500
Commander Lei said,

88
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,420
if we can't catch Ma Xiaonian
in three days,

89
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,460
Director Xu will be dismissed.

90
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,100
My father is throwing a tantrum again.

91
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,500
I'll deal with him when I get home.

92
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,990
Even if Commander Lei didn't say it,

93
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,420
we still need to find him
as soon as possible.

94
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,820
His actions are becoming fiercer.

95
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,100
He even dared to blow Commander.

96
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,180
I really can't imagine

97
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,160
what his next target will be.

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,940
Maniacs act without considering
the consequences.

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,940
What are your thoughts?

100
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,100
Are you asking for my advice?

101
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,340
Say it or save it.

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,140
When engaging in psychological warfare
with a criminal,

103
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,140
anxiety puts us at a disadvantage.

104
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,740
So I think,

105
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,820
at this point,

106
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,140
we should remain calm,

107
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,180
do nothing,

108
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,380
and wait for Ma Xiaonian's next move.

109
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,940
Captain.

110
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,940
Captain.

111
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,450
Ma Xiaonian has sent another letter.

112
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,700
Ma Xiaonian?

113
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,620
(Jiangzhou)

114
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,500
Ma Xiaonian will be waiting for us
on the train.

115
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,180
The bomb he planted

116
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,580
will explode precisely at 3:10.

117
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,780
How many trains are scheduled
this afternoon?

118
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,300
There's only one train
departing at 2:40.

119
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,780
Only fifteen minutes left.

120
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,060
We can't get to the railway station.

121
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,140
This is our only chance.

122
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,420
We must catch it.

123
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,780
Let's go.

124
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,220
Captain!

125
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,620
It's 2:40, we won't make it.

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,940
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

127
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,340
(Jiangzhou Railway Station)
Goodbye, take care.

128
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,420
(Jiangzhou Station)

129
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,780
This train

130
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,060
will pass through several tunnels.

131
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,100
It won't be fast.

132
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,220
We'll take the mountain path.

133
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,280
Try to catch up with it halfway.

134
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,900
Jump!

135
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,940
What time is it?

136
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
One minute to three.

137
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,660
Time is tight.

138
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,580
This is a Swiss watch.

139
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,380
Just to be clear,
I'm only lending it to you.

140
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,100
Catch him, and I'll give you one.

141
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I told you
about Ma Xiaonian's characteristics.

142
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,940
Do you still remember?

143
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,620
(Jiangzhou)
He is small and thin.

144
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,500
He looks cold and gloomy.

145
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,420
He's a man wearing a scarf,

146
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,420
between 40 and 45 years old.

147
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,540
His clothes are old.

148
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,660
But very clean.

149
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,020
He's wearing gloves.

150
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,740
Or deliberately hiding his hands.

151
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,940
Are you a painter?

152
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,220
You should paint

153
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,780
this drifting fine rain,

154
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,980
and us wandering travelers.

155
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,820
He'll keep a distance from people,

156
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,720
and dislikes others' gazes.

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,990
If he is wearing clothes with buttons,

158
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,740
then the top button of his collar

159
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,580
is definitely fastened.

160
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,580
That is Ma Xiaonian.

161
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,660
Perfect.

162
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,660
What's the worst case?

163
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,740
You, me,

164
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,660
and the lives of everyone on this train.

165
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,380
Do you like the rain?

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
Yes.

167
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll paint it for you.

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
Really?

169
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,900
I'll paint it for you.

170
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,140
Please stop looking.

171
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,140
Dad, I want to eat walnuts.

172
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,020
What are you doing?

173
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,860
Sorry.

174
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,700
Sir, please go back to your seat.

175
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,900
The train is about to enter a tunnel.

176
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,990
Got it, I'm going to the restroom.

177
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,900
Okay.

178
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,340
Done.

179
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,660
What, what is this?

180
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,180
Blood rain.

181
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,660
Tell me, where is it?

182
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,740
Speak quickly!

183
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,420
Fifteen o'clock,

184
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,900
and five minutes.

185
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,140
There are five minutes left.

186
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,420
No.

187
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,780
Not even five minutes left.

188
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,700
You can't beat me.

189
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,140
Stop talking nonsense.

190
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,180
Tell me!

191
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,900
Tell me!

192
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,340
I'll talk, I'll talk.

193
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,540
Tell me!

194
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,620
There's a bomb!

195
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,940
It's going to explode.

196
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,580
- There's a bomb.
- Run.

197
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
There's a bomb, run!

198
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,140
Move aside.

199
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,740
Song He.

200
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,100
Let go.

201
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,900
Song He, let go.

202
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,940
You can't strangle him to death.

203
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,020
Trust me.

204
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,660
The mark on the paper.

205
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,990
It should have been drawn
by Ma Xiaonian earlier.

206
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,620
There's a bomb on the tracks.

(Jiangzhou Cotton Mill)

208
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,060
Jiangzhou Cotton Mill.

209
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,740
Quick, the bomb is not on the train.

210
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
It's on the tracks.

211
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,460
His real target is the cotton mill.

212
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,900
He calculated the time precisely.

213
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,860
Once the train explodes,

214
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,660
the train will derail
and crash into the cotton mill

215
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,500
to cause a fire.

216
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,820
And at this very moment,

217
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,960
it is precisely the time
when the mill has the most workers.

218
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,980
Correct.

219
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,620
Regrettably,

220
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,500
it is too late.

222
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,380
No, don't touch that, it's the brake.

223
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,980
- What are you doing?
- Move aside!

224
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,980
You shouldn't

225
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,260
have repeatedly ruined my plans.

226
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,500
I am eliminating harm for Jiangzhou.

227
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,900
Do you understand?

228
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,620
Stop justifying your crimes.

229
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,260
I have never stolen anything.

230
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,980
Why did they frame me?

231
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,180
It's true my father was an executioner,

232
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,180
but I am not.

233
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,700
Maybe you weren't before,

234
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
but now,

235
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
you are an executioner.

236
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,020
Shut up.

237
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,540
Shut up, shut up!

238
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,780
The train can't stop!

239
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,060
Move aside!

240
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,900
You will die!

241
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,860
Song He!

The investigation report from Ningcheng
has been sent over.

246
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,500
According to their investigation,
Ma Xiaonian has been working

247
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
at the Ningcheng armament factory
for the past two years,

248
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,220
under the alias Ma Xiaowu.

249
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,420
Just a month ago.

250
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,820
He stole a considerable amount

251
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,380
of explosives and detonators.

252
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,700
After a preliminary comparison,

253
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,940
they matched the ones

254
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
used in the crime.

255
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,260
I have already submitted this evidence

256
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,860
to the courtroom simultaneously.

257
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,140
They said the evidence is conclusive.

258
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,540
Ma Xiaonian, that man,

259
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,460
is extremely guilty.

260
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,620
He will definitely receive
a severe sentence.

261
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,540
