=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 39=

2
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,180
You killed my father.

3
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,070
Great Master!

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,500
- Great Master!
- You killed my father.

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,650
You killed my father.

6
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,420
He killed my father.

7
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,010
He killed my father.

8
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,510
Tell me.

9
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,430
Who told you to do this?

10
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,270
It was Qin Huole.

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,060
It was Qin Huole!

12
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,430
Keep an eye on him.

13
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,260
(Governor's Mansion)

14
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,350
Sweetie,

15
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,530
eat more.

16
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,060
Look how thin you've become.

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,690
Got it, Father.

18
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,860
Xu Wuwen

19
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
is thoughtless.

20
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,640
If he doesn't improve the meals
at the police station soon,

21
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,300
I'll dismiss him one day.

22
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,640
Are you going to say

23
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,830
that our family cook

24
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,440
should be the director
of the police station?

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,460
Sweetie, as the saying goes,

26
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,250
an army marches on its stomach.

27
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,230
Otherwise, how can the soldiers
on the front line

28
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,020
charge into battle?

29
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160
Xiaofan.

30
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,130
You should come back for meals often.

31
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,550
Otherwise,

32
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,930
the Commander keeps complaining

33
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,980
that the food is not good enough.

34
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,400
The station is short-staffed.

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Not everyone

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,920
can do autopsies.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,760
Right?

38
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,620
I heard there's another murder.

39
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Enjoy the food.

40
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,190
Father, actually, I came back today

41
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,230
because of this.

42
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,550
You must have heard

43
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,450
that Qin Huole is now a murder suspect.

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,010
I have heard that.

45
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,180
But, there are both witnesses and evidence.

46
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,620
What if he really did it?

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,770
Qin Huole is not that kind of person.

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,100
Sweetie, you're naive now.

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,630
People can be two-faced.

50
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,670
Don't be fooled

51
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,100
by that boy's innocent appearance.

52
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,790
Who knows how many tricks

53
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,360
he has in his mind?

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,750
Father, don't forget

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,600
that Qin Huole

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,930
once saved your life.

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,790
Aren't you always grateful?

58
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,100
You can't just let it be.

59
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,770
I'm the most reasonable man.

60
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,770
A debt of gratitude must be repaid.

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,360
I

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,670
will now

63
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,570
call Xu Wuwen.

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Call him?

65
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,160
Ask him to withdraw the wanted notice.

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,720
Then find a scapegoat and shoot him.

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,250
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Father, if everyone handles cases
like you,

69
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
what do we need the police station for?

70
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,450
What do we need the law for?

71
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,930
Have you forgotten?

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,180
The law

73
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,890
is invincible.

74
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,620
Invincible.

75
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,250
Alright, I'll listen to you.

76
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,930
So, what do you suggest me to do?

77
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,660
Commander,

78
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,100
I think Xiaofan means

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,230
that since Qin Huole

80
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,300
is missing now,

81
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,310
why not ask Lieutenant Zou

82
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,100
to take the team to help look for him?

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,830
So he wouldn't fall

84
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,670
into the wrong hands.

85
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,370
As for solving the case,

86
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,570
when we find Qin Huole,

87
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,740
with Xiaofan and Captain Song there,

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,620
do we still need to worry?

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,770
Yes, Father, that's exactly what I mean.

90
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,860
Then why are you looking for me?

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,960
Go to Zou Jing.

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,230
Have him take the team

93
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,740
to search around

94
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,080
Jiangzhou

95
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,660
to catch that boy. Wouldn't that be enough?

96
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,980
Thank you, Father.

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,740
Sweetie, where are you going?

98
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,960
Look at this girl.

99
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
So rash and impetuous.

100
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,370
Who does she get it from?

101
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,060
Didn't she get it from you, Commander?

102
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,220
What's wrong with that?

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,670
Miss, rest assured.

104
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,920
I'll take them to look for him right away.

105
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,280
When you find Qin Huole,

106
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,480
notify me immediately.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
Understood.

108
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,470
Miss.

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,330
Captain Song just called.

110
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,400
He asked you to go to Nanxiang Inn

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
for an important issue.

112
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,100
Alright, stop the car.

113
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,670
- Here.
- Thank you.

114
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,620
Any news about Huole?

115
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,270
No.

116
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,570
But we have a clue about the real culprit.

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,740
On the matchbox he dropped,

118
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,980
(Nanxiang Matches)
it says Nanxiang.

119
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,380
(Nanxiang Inn).

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,870
Are you two checking in?

121
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,420
(Jiangzhou Police Station)
One room or...?

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,660
Sir, I must have slept too deeply.

123
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,110
What can I do for you?

124
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,950
Just say the word.

125
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,420
(Nanxiang Matches)

126
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,180
I'm looking for someone.

127
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,500
A bald man in his twenties.

128
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,960
He has a tattoo here.

129
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,800
Has he stayed here?

130
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,510
Yes.

131
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,500
- Which room?
- Let me check.

132
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,220
The first room on the second floor.

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Lead the way.

134
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,590
This is the room.

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,040
Sir, take your time. I'll go downstairs.

136
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,980
Alright, thank you.

137
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,130
This person is very alert

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,980
and quite good at martial arts.

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Are you sure he is the one
who induced Youlan

140
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,720
and Abao?

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,750
I have already investigated
Huanyinglou before I came here.

142
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,350
Du Jingtian had been alone with him
in the room

143
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:00,990
for ten minutes.

144
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,910
After coming out,

145
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,210
he went and killed the Great Master.

146
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,010
Tell me, who told you to do this?

147
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,050
It was Qin Huole.

148
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,940
It was Qin Huole!

149
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
But at Huanyinglou,

150
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,360
it was not Huole

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,200
who met with Du Jingtian.

152
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,940
It seems

153
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,370
Huole had never gone
to Master Du's house.

154
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,960
The person Abao saw that night

155
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
was not Huole either.

156
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
Very likely.

157
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,740
What kind of sorcery

158
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,840
can make someone so obedient

159
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,700
in such a short time?

160
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
Since we have another suspect now,

161
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,400
can we lift

162
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,530
the wanted notice for Huole?

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,100
The current clues are not enough.

164
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,100
We need to find evidence.

165
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,050
The two shoe prints are different.

166
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,100
Does he have an accomplice?

167
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
The size is the same.

168
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,940
(Jiangzhou Jiacheng Shoe Store.
A pair of shoes.)

169
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,700
It seems he changed into a new pair
of shoes.

170
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,770
Logically speaking,

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,410
there should be an old pair of shoes
in the room.

172
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,860
Maybe he threw them away.

173
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
Why did he change into a new pair

174
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,510
of shoes before the action?

175
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,510
If the shoes don't fit,

176
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,500
wouldn't that ruin everything?

177
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,340
If it wasn't because the old shoes
were broken,

178
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,130
then there must be another reason.

179
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,890
For example, you are suspecting
that his old shoes

180
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,340
might lead us to him.

181
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,110
Did everything go smoothly
with Great Master's matter?

182
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,950
Yes, it did.

183
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,700
Song He is smart.

184
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,170
Did you reveal any flaws?

185
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,350
Probably not.

186
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
Tomorrow, I will take Qin Huole

187
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,480
away from Jiangzhou.

188
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,130
Be careful yourself.

189
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,200
Don't worry.

190
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,100
When will you be back?

191
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,700
That's not for me to decide.

192
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,250
In any case,

193
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
when it's the right time,

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,370
I will definitely return.

195
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,390
By the way, you mentioned last time

196
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,980
that there is another big shot
to deal with.

197
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,820
I wonder

198
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,700
what Mr. Night God's plan is.

199
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,220
(Mr. Night God?)

200
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,890
Mr. Night God is very satisfied
with you.

201
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,800
You can go back now.

202
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,940
Thank you for your trouble.

203
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,800
Why are you here?

204
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,760
Of course, for the bounty.

205
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,770
Otherwise, why would I save you?

206
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,100
We don't have any special relationship.

207
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,860
Is your injury okay?

208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,750
It's fine, just a minor injury.

209
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,650
I played dead to survive.

210
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,770
That's for the stab.

211
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,350
Let's go.

212
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,460
Huole told me before

213
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,080
that if I have any tricky problems,

214
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,100
I can listen to your thoughts.

215
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,340
Because your thinking

216
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,340
can sometimes cross many barriers
instantly

217
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,990
and almost perfectly align

218
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,220
with the murderer's perspective.

219
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,840
It's hard for an ordinary person

220
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,750
to reach Xiaofan's level

221
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,370
without professional training.

222
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,500
She can clearly

223
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,520
stand in the murderer's shoes

224
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,300
to think about problems.

225
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,890
She is practically
the murderer's nightmare.

226
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,050
Fortunately, she is not
on the opposite side of us.

227
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,110
Otherwise,

228
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,770
she would be our nightmare.

229
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,290
Then I must help Huole even more.

230
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Let me think.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,770
Instinctively,

232
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,870
I think the problem might be

233
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,340
that Huole shouldn't have gone

234
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,800
to Youlong Gambling House
at the wrong time,

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,790
which made him

236
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,860
the scapegoat for the murderer.

237
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,340
Do you mean

238
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,130
Huole got involved by accident?

239
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,400
Yes.

240
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,910
Maybe the murderer's original plan

241
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,620
was only to get rid of the three tigers
of Jiangzhou.

242
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,270
Huole's sudden appearance

243
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,320
made the murderer change

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,270
his original plan.

245
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,170
and make Huole a part of it.

246
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,740
What about the motive?

247
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,550
Who would want to get rid of
the three tigers of Jiangzhou so badly?

248
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,830
Revenge.

249
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,530
I heard from my father

250
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,510
that these three were prominent
in Jiangzhou.

251
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,960
Whether in terms of wealth or power,

252
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,200
they were not to be underestimated.

253
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
Even my father wants to recruit them

254
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,370
into Lei's Army.

255
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,100
You don't suspect my father, do you?

256
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,500
Impossible.

257
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,080
If my father wanted to kill them,

258
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,650
he could just find a reason
and shoot them.

259
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,410
Why go through all this trouble?

260
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Exactly.

261
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,220
If Commander Lei wanted to do this,

262
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,510
it would be much simpler

263
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,550
than the current situation.

264
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,070
We are safe now.

265
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,470
Where are we going?

266
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,860
- Police station.
- Where?

267
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,920
Police station.

268
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,740
Isn't that the jail?

269
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,750
I'm not going in.

270
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,010
That place is too unlucky.

271
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,170
- You go by yourself.
- Don't you want the bounty?

272
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
No way.

273
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,530
You collect it for me first.

274
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,580
Aren't you afraid I won't admit it later?

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,050
Then you won't get a single penny.

276
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,250
At worst, I'll kidnap you again.

277
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,920
Thanks, Tianlang.

278
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,070
You're really righteous.

279
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,160
A true hero.

280
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,890
Stop flattering me.

281
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,770
A wise man knows when to retreat.

282
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,240
- Righteous, huh?
- Catch the one who runs away.

283
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,710
Don't move.

284
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,740
Qin Huole.

285
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,650
You made it hard for me to find you.

286
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,370
Try running away this time.

287
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,520
Hold on.

288
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,250
I was really framed.

289
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,580
If you don't believe me,

290
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,910
ask Cheng Tianlang when you get him.

291
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,010
He can testify for me.

292
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,150
I really didn't see Master Du
last night.

293
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,600
You must have seen Master Long.

294
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
I...

295
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,710
It's about to rain.

296
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,710
Let me take you home.

297
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,640
Thank you.

298
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,560
Wait a moment.

299
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,820
There's sand in my shoe.
It's hurting my foot.

300
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,370
Trying to play tricks on me?

301
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,830
Qin Huole.

302
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,700
A life for a life.

303
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,700
This date of next year

304
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,700
will be your death anniversary.

305
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Well,

306
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,710
not necessarily.

307
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,320
Got hit?

308
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,640
Not yet.

309
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,890
Don't just stand there. Let's go home.

310
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Stop right there.
