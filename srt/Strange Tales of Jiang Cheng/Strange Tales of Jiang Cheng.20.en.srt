=Episode 20=

2
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,060
(Temple of Guan Yu)

3
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,500
(Dear heroic mother, Zhan Ruhua
Dear heroic father, Zhen Jianglong)

4
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,180
Haven't you seen a girl?

5
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,470
Go over there to take a look.

6
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,450
Brother, don't be angry.

7
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,690
You were so irritable.

8
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,870
We almost got exposed.

9
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,040
I was irritable?

10
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,600
That postman deserved to die.

11
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,800
If no one came,

12
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,690
I would watch his blood

13
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,870
draining out bit by bit.

14
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,130
Brother,

15
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,600
he's already dead.

16
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,670
Talking about it now is useless.

17
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,800
The urgent matter now

18
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,480
is to think of a way

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,220
to make He Lingyu

20
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,020
suffer more than seven years ago.

21
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,500
Brother, I...

22
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,260
Don't cry.

23
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,100
Shh,

24
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,940
don't cry.

25
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,180
Don't cry.

26
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,100
Brother, Brother!

27
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,220
If you don't want to drink, then never.

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,100
Brother,

29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,300
you are so irritable.

30
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
I can't wait any longer.

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,380
Wu Yi, think of a way quickly.

32
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,340
Leave it to me.

33
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,740
The knot on this rope

34
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,580
is very special.

35
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,620
I've never seen it before.

36
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,500
What about you guys?

37
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,540
Indeed, it's very special.

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,220
It took me a lot of effort

39
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,380
to take the rope

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,460
off the victim's neck.

41
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,460
Leave the knot problem to me.

42
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,940
- Chen.
- Here.

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,780
I want you to go through

44
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,060
all the newspapers in Jiangzhou

45
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,640
since the day the three brothers

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,820
committed their first crime.

47
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,940
Focus on the obituary column,

48
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,860
especially those cases
where both husband and wife died.

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,180
I want your findings as soon as you finish.

50
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,020
Yes.

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,420
Captain, do you have
any other instructions?

52
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,900
Didn't he already give you
an instruction?

53
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,780
Go.

54
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,060
Yes.

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
If this doesn't work,

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,940
you should go ask Commander Lei
for help.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,620
He has so many men under him.

58
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,700
If they all go out to look for Niannian,

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,980
they will definitely find her.

60
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,500
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,340
Do you think the Lei's Army
is under my command?

62
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,780
Besides,

63
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,020
Niannian is in their hands.

64
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,780
What if they hurt Niannian?

65
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,180
What should we do then?

66
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,220
My daughter

67
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,100
must be so scared right now.

68
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
Lingyu,

69
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,900
we have already lost Yinyin.

70
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,300
We can't lose Niannian too.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,740
Stop crying.

72
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,460
I'll go discuss it
with Captain Song again.

73
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,660
Detective Qin,

74
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,580
please explain it to me.

75
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,660
Why did you ask Chen Zheng

76
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,860
to investigate the obituaries?

77
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,900
I really can't figure out

78
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,420
the connection here.

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,740
If you had left Jiangzhou for years,

80
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,660
what would bring you back?

81
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,020
Homesickness, visiting relatives,

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,540
an old friend's wedding,
or a close relative's death?

83
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
To sum it up,

84
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,300
it's either weddings or funerals.

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,700
They hadn't been hiding
in Jiangzhou all along.

86
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,780
The truth is, they had left Jiangzhou
for many years.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,580
It must be some special event

88
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,460
that brings them back.

89
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,300
As for this special event,

90
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,140
I tend to think it's a death day

91
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,300
rather than anything else.

92
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Are you saying

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,060
that the reason why the three brothers

94
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,580
committed so many bloody crimes

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,620
is related to the death
of their relatives?

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,780
In other words, the three victimized families

97
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,640
are connected to the death

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,780
of the three brothers' parents.

99
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,820
Go on.

100
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,900
That's all I can think of for now.

101
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,540
Wait a minute.

102
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,540
Why do you tend to think

103
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,620
that their parents were both dead?

104
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,780
Because every time
when they committed a crime,

105
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,500
the victims' parents were present

106
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,540
without exception.

107
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,420
This should be a form of pain substitution.

108
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,300
Subconsciously,

109
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,460
the three brothers

110
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,860
find consolation in their doing.

111
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,380
Detective Qin, you are right.

112
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,620
Captain Song.

113
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
Captain Song.

114
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Captain Song.

115
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,020
- Hello?
- Mr. He.

116
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,460
Please don't be too sad.

117
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,540
Mr. He.

118
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,900
The kidnappers will not hurt Niannian

119
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
before their psychological needs
are met.

120
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,740
Now we have already

121
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,780
gathered a lot of clues.

122
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
We believe we will find out what happened

123
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,260
to the three brothers soon.

124
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,100
Yes.

125
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,220
Mr. He,

126
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,580
what you need to do now

127
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,620
is to wait and trust us.

128
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,220
Sir,

129
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,900
the kidnappers called.

130
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,140
Give my daughter back.

131
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,260
Give my daughter back to me.

132
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,660
- Mrs. He.
- Please!

133
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,260
Mrs. He, let's go upstairs for some rest.

134
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,300
Come on.

135
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,500
I am He Lingyu.

136
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,620
If you have any grievances,

137
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,620
direct them to me.

138
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm willing to take all your punishment.

139
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,060
Just don't hurt my daughter anymore.

140
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,140
I beg you. Don't...

141
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,460
Mr. He, you take care of Mrs. He.

142
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,820
Leave it to us.

143
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,580
Trust us.

144
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,020
Hello.

145
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,940
Who is this?

146
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,380
About Niannian,

147
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,500
I will negotiate with you

148
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,860
on behalf of Mr. He.

149
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,900
Let He Lingyu answer the phone.

150
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,420
Like I said, I will talk with you.

151
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,020
Are you a police?

152
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,380
Yes.

153
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,140
He Lingyu dares to call the police?

154
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
Interesting.

155
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,740
My brothers and I

156
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,260
don't have time to talk to you.

157
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,460
Fine.

158
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,260
Then let's talk when you want to.

159
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,100
Hello?

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,580
Hello?

161
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,340
You are too bold.

162
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,860
How will we know if we don't give it a try?

163
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,700
Try?

164
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,100
Mr. He's daughter is in their hands.

165
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,940
You gave it a try?

166
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Trust me.

167
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,620
Hello?

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,420
Call him back.

169
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,180
I'm telling you, if Niannian got hurt

170
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,060
because of you,

171
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,140
I'll get you for that!

172
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,580
Kid, do you know the consequences
of doing this?

173
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,820
Not interested.

174
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,980
You...

175
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,380
If you dare hang up again,

176
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,100
I'll kill that girl right now!

177
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,900
Whatever.

178
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,940
I...

179
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,300
Brother, calm down.

180
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,420
- Calm down.
- Are you crazy?

181
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Are you crazy?

182
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,500
Dealing with madmen,

183
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,660
you have to be crazier than them.

184
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Don't hang up the phone.

185
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,700
Don't hang up.

186
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
My brother

187
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,140
was a bit emotional just now.

188
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,340
But now

189
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,780
we have to admit

190
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,900
that we need to have a good talk.

191
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,500
Alright.

192
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
So, do you and your brothers

193
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,860
dare to bet with me?

194
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,180
Bet on what?

195
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
Speak quickly.

196
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,740
Bet on Mr. He's daughter.

197
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,020
Within three days,

198
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,420
if I find you,

199
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,740
then release her.

200
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
What if you can't find us?

201
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,940
Then kill her.

202
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,140
- And me. I will be yours, too.
- You...

203
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,420
What are you hesitating for?

204
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,180
This way, you give Mr. He hopes,

205
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,860
but in the end,

206
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,780
he might face even greater pain.

207
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,260
Isn't this what you want?

208
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,860
One day.

209
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,860
Two days.

210
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,020
Stop talking nonsense, one day it is.

211
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,940
Before noon tomorrow,

212
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,060
if you lose,

213
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,460
that girl will lose her life.

214
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,820
It's a deal.

215
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,620
What's wrong with him?

216
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,700
He's gone mad.

217
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,380
That sound.

218
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,540
It's a water truck.

219
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,820
What water truck?

220
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,300
Before the kidnapper hung up the phone,

221
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,460
I heard a bell sound.

222
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,620
That's the bell of a water truck.

223
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,140
The public phones in Jiangzhou

224
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,540
are distributed along the main streets.

225
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,020
The water trucks also follow

226
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,380
- fixed routes.
- Right.

227
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,800
The phone booth

228
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,500
which the water truck passed by
at nine o'clock

229
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,980
is where the three brothers
made the call.

230
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
Right.

231
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,300
Hello, this is Song He.

232
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,820
Find a map of public phone distributions
in the city immediately.

233
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,180
And, ask the Water Authority

234
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,100
to provide today's attendance list
of water truck drivers.

235
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,940
Do it right now.

236
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,740
Well, how about

237
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,100
discussing it with me

238
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,700
before you take any action?

239
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,140
I just suddenly realized

240
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,660
that we can't keep being led by them.

241
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,060
Only by disrupting their arrangements

242
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,420
can we make their flaws exposed.

243
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,820
Tomorrow at noon.

244
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,020
We don't have much time left.

245
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,220
Let's head back first.

246
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,540
- Xiaofan.
- I'll stay.

247
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,660
If anything happens,

248
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,140
I'll notify you immediately.

249
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,980
Alright.

250
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,180
Can we

251
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,980
bring Niannian back tomorrow?

252
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,940
Niannian will definitely
come back safely.

253
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,460
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

254
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,860
This record seems not right.

255
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,060
Detective Qin.

256
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
You have a visitor.

257
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,460
Captain Song. Young Master.

258
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,500
Uncle Fu, why are you here?

259
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,540
Young Master.

260
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,140
You haven't been home for days.

261
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,460
Your father asked me to check on you.

262
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,980
I brought some homemade dishes.

263
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,060
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

264
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,460
Share them with the guys.

265
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,580
Thank you, Detective Qin.

266
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,140
What's wrong, Uncle Fu?

267
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Nothing.

268
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,860
Can I take a look?

269
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,140
- Sure.
- Don't grab. There's enough

270
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
for everyone.

271
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,620
Isn't this the magic lock?

272
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,180
Magic lock?

273
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,000
