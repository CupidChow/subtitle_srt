=Episode 32=

2
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,350
You should

3
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,160
have spent a lot of time

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,500
with Cheng Zhiyuan and Zhao Xuanxue.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,490
Do you know they were lovers?

6
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,690
Zhiyuan

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,660
did have feelings for Xuanxue.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,410
But actually,

9
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,520
Xuanxue

10
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,300
didn't like Zhiyuan.

11
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,490
Did

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,770
Zhao Xuanxue tell you so?

13
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,910
Over the years,

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,770
Leader Chen has always been very strict

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,740
with Xuanxue.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,460
Although he didn't often beat
or scold her,

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,110
every now and then,

18
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,410
he would still reprimand her.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,380
Xuanxue.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,940
Thank you, Xiaohe.

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,270
Sis,

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,200
why do you have

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,500
to go against him?

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,400
In the end, you're always

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,540
the one who suffers.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,940
I've had enough of living
like this every day.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
I just want to live like a human,

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,850
not some goods to be sold.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,800
He said

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,570
he'd make Xuanxue a star performer,

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,410
but actually,

32
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,010
everyone knew in their hearts

33
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,780
that he took her as a cash cow,

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
hoping one day

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,010
to sell her for a good price.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,290
Even though Xuanxue didn't like it,

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,340
what can she do?

38
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,250
He had our indentures anyway.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,900
If you really can't take it anymore,

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,010
then just leave.

41
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,290
If you can't bear to leave Zhiyuan,

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,410
then let him take you away.

43
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,450
Cheng Zhiyuan?

44
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,900
Why would I leave with him?

45
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,900
Aren't you two...

46
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,690
I have nothing to do with him.

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,970
I don't care what he thinks,

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,850
but I don't have feelings for him.

49
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,110
Everyone in the opera troupe

50
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,780
thought they were lovers.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,710
Even Zhiyuan thought Xuanxue

52
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,060
had feelings for him.

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,450
Except for me,

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,900
even Leader Chen didn't know the truth.

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,690
So,

56
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,150
Leader Chen was afraid Zhiyuan

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,620
would affect Xuanxue.

58
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,380
He decided

59
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,500
to betroth me to Zhiyuan.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,060
You know what?

61
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,920
I have invested all my assets

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,620
in Zhao Xuanxue.

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,730
You could say it's a do-or-die gamble.

64
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,220
I won't allow anyone

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,220
to disrupt my plans.

66
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,970
As for that Du Xiaohe,

67
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,250
she won't become a star performer
anyway.

68
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,130
It's better to find her a good match
early.

69
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,830
Leader Chen.

70
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,150
In your eyes,

71
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,240
is everyone in the troupe

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,410
your tool?

73
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,780
Of course.

74
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,850
It's backscratching.

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,250
Leader.

76
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,950
Leader.

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,450
Please fulfill our wish.

78
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,870
Zhiyuan,

79
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,730
I have watched you grow up.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,540
It's not that I don't care about you

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
How about this?

82
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,850
I'll betroth Du Xiaohe to you.

83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Leader, I like Xuanxue.

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,170
Let me finish.

85
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
I've told you

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,020
I want to make Xuanxue a star performer.

87
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,610
Her future

88
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,930
is not in our small troupe, understand?

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,460
If you marry Xiaohe,

90
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,020
you and Xuanxue

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,540
can just give up this idea completely.

92
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,630
Right?

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
I did everything

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,290
for the sake of our opera troupe.

95
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,220
If you listen to me,

96
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,050
when I die,

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,410
the Chunshou Troupe

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,170
will be handed over to you.

99
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,100
(Signed by Chen Shouting)

100
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,730
From this perspective,

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
Cheng Zhiyuan indeed had

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,020
no reason to kill Zhao Xuanxue.

103
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,020
He should want you

104
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,660
to be dead the most.

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,280
Yes.

106
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,170
You are quite straightforward,

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,490
but it's true.

108
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,340
Then let me be more straightforward,

109
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,970
Leader Chen, who do you think

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,850
killed Zhao Xuanxue?

111
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,340
Who is the real murderer?

112
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,880
I dare not say.

113
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,810
I dare not speak carelessly.

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,580
You police

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,340
talk about evidence, right?

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,580
I am all alone in this world.

117
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,610
If it weren't for Leader Chen

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,150
and friends from the Chunshou Troupe,

119
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,900
I wouldn't have survived long ago.

120
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,900
Although I have

121
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,170
no personal feelings for Zhiyuan,

122
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,540
they are like my family.

123
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,370
Xuanxue is dead.

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,730
I am really sad.

125
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,510
But I don't believe

126
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,200
Zhiyuan would do such a thing.

127
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,040
Captain Song,

128
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,290
you are a good man.

129
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,580
You must justify for Zhiyuan.

130
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,050
We will do our best

131
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,730
to find the truth

132
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,970
and give justice to the victim.

133
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,140
We will not wrong any good person.

134
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,580
Thank you for your clues.

135
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,990
Go back and rest.

136
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,670
Wu Xi,

137
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,800
who made the pear soup

138
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,930
that Cheng Zhiyuan drank

139
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,920
before he went on stage?

140
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,830
It was ordered in advance

141
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,500
(Wu Xi from the Chunshou Troupe)
from a restaurant.

142
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,240
Which restaurant?

143
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,540
Huifengtang Restaurant.

144
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,520
Did you pick up the pear soup,

145
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,780
or did the restaurant staff deliver it?

146
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,000
It was delivered.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,810
I received it outside
the backstage door.

148
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,760
Then think about it carefully again.

149
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,650
When you took the pear soup

150
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,730
to the backstage,

151
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,900
what was Zhao Xuanxue doing?

152
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,660
She was putting on makeup.

153
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,670
What about the others?

154
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,810
The others...

155
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,340
The pear soup is here!

156
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,750
Mr. Cheng,

157
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,290
as per your instructions,

158
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,550
the soup was stewed

159
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,490
with the best Cangxi pears.

160
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
After drinking it,

161
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,540
your voice will be crisp and clear.

162
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,990
Thank you.

163
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,810
No problem, you go ahead.

164
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,340
Leader.

165
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,730
Is there anything else?

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,410
The staff from Huifengtang Restaurant

167
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,460
asked me to check with you.

168
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,050
After tonight's performance,

169
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,700
do you want to prepare a feast?

170
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,870
Xuanxue,

171
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,550
what do you think?

172
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,290
I think it's not necessary.

173
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,410
Commander Lei is coming

174
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,260
to watch the show today, right?

175
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,700
Right,

176
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,850
that's true.

177
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,900
As long as we perform well,

178
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
maybe there might be a reward

179
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,540
when he's happy.

180
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,810
Right? What do you think?

181
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,220
Did you hear that?

182
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,700
Don't just stand there.

183
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,850
Alright, I'll go answer them.

184
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,140
Leader Chen

185
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,140
asked Zhao Xuanxue

186
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,930
about everything.

187
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,730
As long as Zhao Xuanxue said no,

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,170
it is certain

189
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
that it won't work.

190
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like Zhao Xuanxue was the troupe leader.

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,140
So, now that Zhao Xuanxue was killed,

192
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,660
are you particularly happy about it?

193
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,790
I...

194
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,550
No, no, that's not true.

195
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,410
Stop pretending.

196
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,070
With just one word, she blocked

197
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,990
you from making extra money.

198
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,140
You still won't admit it?

199
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,050
I'm just a handyman.

200
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,020
Leader Chen

201
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,190
only provided food and lodging,

202
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,030
but no wages.

203
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,620
I had no other choice

204
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,450
but to help those restaurants

205
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,620
talk some nice words to them

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,290
to earn some extra money.

207
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,210
But anyhow,

208
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,690
I wouldn't resort to poisoning
because of this.

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,150
Besides,

210
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,410
how would I know of any poison

211
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,140
that could kill someone?

212
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,120
If I had such skills,
why would I still be here?

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
I would come to Commander Lei...

214
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
Pff.

215
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,920
Commander Lei wouldn't care about

216
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,810
your lousy tricks.

217
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,860
Let me ask you again.

218
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,950
Did anyone else touch

219
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,140
the bowl of pear soup

220
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,810
that Cheng Zhiyuan drank
before going on stage?

221
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,570
At that time, there were

222
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,050
only us on backstage.

223
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
Zhiyuan,

224
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,620
keep your mind calm
and your body steady.

225
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,870
Don't rush.

226
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,260
Come back, you...

227
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,900
Shall I drag him back?

228
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,410
It's too late.

229
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,460
(Uncle Xi, makeup artist
from the Chunshou Troupe)

230
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870
What do you

231
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,930
think of

232
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,030
the makeup artist, Uncle Xi?

233
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,450
Uncle Xi?

234
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,870
Well...

235
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,450
Just tell us directly.

236
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,020
Uncle Xi

237
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,540
has been in the Chunshou Troupe
for some time.

238
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,620
He joined it only a few months later
than Du Xiaohe,

239
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,620
and even earlier than Zhao Xuanxue.

240
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,860
Maybe because he looked scary,

241
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,740
he didn't talk much usually.

242
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,360
However, he seemed to have

243
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,530
a good relationship with Du Xiaohe.

244
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,660
The two of them

245
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,600
always whispered in secret.

246
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,840
As for

247
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,290
what exactly they have done,

248
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,270
well, I...

249
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,140
I have no idea.

250
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,820
(Relationship Diagram of the Murderer)

251
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,780
While everyone was on the scene,

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,050
how was the datura

253
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,190
mixed

254
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,030
into this pear soup?

255
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,790
Wu Xi's motive for killing Zhao Xuanxue

256
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,630
is insufficient.

257
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,780
Then there's only one last possibility left.

258
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,030
What is it?

259
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,030
The datura

260
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,020
was mixed into the pear soup
by Cheng Zhiyuan himself.

261
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,570
As I mentioned before,

262
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,240
the poison from datura

263
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,520
can cause delusion and madness.

264
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,410
But even so,

265
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,360
a poisoned person

266
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,740
won't necessarily commit murder.

267
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
But if there's an external influence,

268
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,900
it will change the situation drastically.

269
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,150
I don't understand.

270
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,310
Can you explain in detail?

271
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,660
Xiaofan means

272
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,090
that from poisoning to murder,

273
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,810
there's something else,

274
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,660
which is external guidance.

275
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
For example,

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
if you were poisoned,

277
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,880
you would only go to kill someone

278
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
if I guide you to.

279
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,190
But in Cheng Zhiyuan's case,

280
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,810
from poisoning to murder,

281
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,310
there was no external guidance

282
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,150
at all.

283
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,210
So, there's only one answer

284
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,670
that the so-called external influence

285
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,660
was himself.

286
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,680
His true intention

287
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,330
was to kill Zhao Xuanxue.

288
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,480
Do you understand now?

289
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Alright, it's late.

290
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,720
Let's go rest.

291
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,980
Good night.

292
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Good night.

293
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,980
Where are you going?

294
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,670
Going home to sleep.

295
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,310
The case hasn't been solved yet.
How can you go home?

296
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,230
There's a lounge next door.
Just make do with it for the night.

297
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,240
I need to go home to shower

298
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
and change clothes.

299
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,880
So fussy.

300
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,310
You should follow the rules here.

301
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,260
What rules?

302
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,790
I just like to stay clean.

303
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,630
Unlike you, you've been wearing
the same clothes for days.

304
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,680
I can smell you from far away.

305
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,690
- What smell?
- I...

306
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,660
If there's a smell, it's the masculine smell.

307
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,070
- Masculine?
- Alright, you two stop arguing.

308
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,330
If you keep arguing, it'll be dawn soon.

309
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,760
When I come over tomorrow,

310
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,990
I'll go to your house and ask Uncle Fu
for a set of your clothes.

311
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,960
What about you?

312
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't need it.

313
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,030
I'm not that fussy.

314
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,900
Alright, see you tomorrow then.

315
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,240
Wait a minute.

316
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,980
Why can Xiaofan go home?

317
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,550
She's a coroner,

318
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
not a detective.

319
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,510
Besides,

320
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,600
do you really want Xiaofan to squeeze
in one room with us?

321
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,540
One room?

322
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,930
Are there not enough beds?

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,570
Stop dreaming.

324
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,810
There aren't any beds at all.

325
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,780
Just two chairs. Let's go.

326
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,020
Chairs?

327
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,020
(Mantangchun Theater)

328
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,910
I've checked it all.

329
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,910
There's no problem.

330
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,540
Uncle Xi, right?

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,620
The carvings on this box
are very exquisite.

332
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,930
Your craftsmanship is impressive.

333
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,570
How do you know Uncle Xi made it
himself?

334
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,640
A pair of old, rough hands,

335
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,980
with many cuts on the fingertips

336
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,980
and thick calluses on the palms.

337
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,030
This

338
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,020
should be Uncle Xi's work, right?

339
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,210
This peony is really beautiful.

340
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,290
It's even more exquisite than those
at Wanbao Store.

341
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,790
I'm flattered.

342
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,500
I made it for fun.

343
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,600
Uncle Xi,

344
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,270
before Zhao Xuanxue went on stage
last night,

345
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,620
did she say anything to you?

346
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,390
Nothing?

347
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,570
Did she tell you anything or not?

348
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
Miss Xuanxue,

349
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,780
the performance is about to start.

350
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,210
If you have something to say,

351
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,170
you can talk to me

352
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,260
after the performance, okay?

353
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,200
It's nothing.

354
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,170
I was so careless.

355
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,210
If I had reported it to the leader earlier,

356
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,620
maybe Miss Xuanxue
could have been saved.

357
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,450
You mean,

358
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,000
the dagger Cheng Zhiyuan used

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,170
to kill Zhao Xuanxue

360
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,170
was brought on stage
by Zhao Xuanxue herself?

361
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,510
Yes.

362
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,960
I saw it

363
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,540
with my own eyes on stage.

364
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,980
It seems your speculation was correct.

365
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,090
Zhao Xuanxue knew about it in advance

366
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,330
and even provided the weapon
to kill herself.

367
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,260
But why?

368
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,290
Why did she choose to do it on the stage

369
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,720
and use Cheng Zhiyuan's hand

370
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,760
to end her own life

371
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,810
in public?

372
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,400
Maybe she really didn't

373
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,090
want to be controlled
by Chen Shouting anymore.

374
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,690
So she chose to commit suicide.

375
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,660
But why on the stage?

376
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,190
She knew that she alone

377
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,380
couldn't get rid of Chen Shouting.

378
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,980
So she had to bring down
the entire troupe.

379
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,740
Only then could she escape
this nightmare.

380
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,030
She knew

381
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,480
that Commander Lei's favorite

382
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,430
was the third mistress.

383
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,120
So, ruining this performance

384
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,240
on her birthday

385
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,230
was the quickest way

386
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,410
to destroy the Chunshou Troupe.

387
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,670
This was her revenge against Chen Shouting

388
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,210
and the life in the opera troupe.
