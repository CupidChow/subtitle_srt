=Episode 33=

2
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,660
What do you think?

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,940
What Song He said

4
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,740
does seem quite reasonable.

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,000
However,

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,050
it can't explain the most crucial point.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,840
Based on what Zhao Xuanxue said

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,020
to Du Xiaohe,

9
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,940
she should have no intention of seeking death.

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
Maybe...

11
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,890
I mean maybe

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,080
this was not

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,040
Zhao Xuanxue's original plan.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,960
It was altered during the execution,

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,300
and it happened without her knowledge.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,550
What do you mean?

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,490
I mean...

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,520
Leader!

19
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,000
A man who hung himself
would die with his mouth open,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,800
the tip of his tongue
protruding a bit beyond the teeth,

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,940
his face reddish-purple,

22
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,060
his hands clenched into fists,

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,380
but his thumbs and toes pointing downward.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,010
And there would be blood stains on the legs,

25
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,410
like burn marks.

26
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,540
He was hung to death.

27
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,990
Come in to talk.

28
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,670
Please sit.

29
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,430
Here,

30
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,780
have a cup of water to calm down.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,640
By the way,

32
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,850
we had a long talk last night,

33
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,730
but I still don't know
where you're from.

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,730
I'm from Jianchuan.

35
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,170
I became an orphan over ten years ago

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,290
and then I started learning
from Leader Chen.

37
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,500
It was two years earlier than Xuanxue.

38
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,410
You're from Jianchuan.

39
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,970
This morning,

40
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,660
did Leader Chen say anything to you?

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,290
Everything was normal.

42
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,520
Over the years,

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
he led the Chunshou Troupe

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,010
to perform all over the country

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,850
and had become ill from overwork.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,900
He needed to take some tonic pills.

47
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,500
Leader.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,690
The medicine is ready.

49
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,170
I'll go fetch some water.

50
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,290
Every time when he took his medicine,

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,100
I would go fetch a basin of water,

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,830
so that he could wash his face
and take some rest

53
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,130
after he took the medicine.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,410
When I returned with the water,

55
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,540
I saw he...

56
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,340
My condolences.

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,220
May I ask

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,360
if you were the one who prepared

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,540
his medicine?

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,630
Yes.

61
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,370
How long did it take

62
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,370
to fetch water?

63
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,810
About 15 minutes.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,340
Fifteen minutes?

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,430
So long?

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,540
Because I was worried about Zhiyuan.

67
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,930
I happened to pass by there.

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,370
So I went to check on him.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
At that time,

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,640
the other two police officers
were also there.

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,700
I chatted a bit with them.

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,930
Sorry for the loss.

73
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,430
Don't be too sad.

74
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,310
How did it go?

75
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,020
There's no problem.

76
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,630
Are you sure?

77
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,510
I'm sure.

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,410
Why, is there something suspicious?

79
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,020
I just feel something is off.

80
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,850
Though Zhao Xuanxue's death

81
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,970
was a big blow to Chen Shouting,

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,680
considering Chen Shouting's mindset

83
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,640
and personality,

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,220
he didn't seem like a man
who would commit suicide.

85
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,370
It doesn't make sense.

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
At least,

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,170
I can't be convinced.

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,730
But Chen Shouting did hang himself.

89
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,760
And at that time,

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,050
there were no visitors.

91
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,540
But someone who was about
to commit suicide

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,270
wouldn't be in the mood

93
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,660
to take some tonic pills.

94
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,020
Is it possible

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,050
that Chen Shouting was also controlled

96
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,350
by datura poison like Cheng Zhiyuan?

97
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,220
It's just that Cheng killed others,

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,260
while Chen killed himself.

99
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,120
Then we need to examine
Chen Shouting's corpse

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,280
to see if there's anything unusual.

101
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,260
It's easy for you.

102
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,190
Nothing unusual.

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,580
Are you relieved now?

104
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,290
Besides this poison testing method,

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,910
is there a more accurate

106
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,810
and more professional way?

107
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,560
Before I became a coroner,

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,640
I had read

109
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,340
a lot of medical books.

110
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,030
Others might not have a way,

111
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,460
but I certainly do.

112
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,350
It's just that this method

113
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,190
is a bit troublesome.

114
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,340
I need your cooperation.

115
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,230
No problem. What can I help you?

116
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,070
Just let me know.

117
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,970
First, prepare a bowl of glutinous rice.

118
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,590
Wash it clean,

119
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,540
wrap it in cotton cloth,

120
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,660
and place it in a pot to steam it.

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,880
Then prepare three to five strips
of new cotton wadding,

122
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,910
and two liters of aged vinegar.

123
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,810
Boil the aged vinegar with high heat.

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,830
Then put the cotton wadding
into the pot.

125
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,050
Boil it for half an hour.

126
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,120
Next, take some brown rice,

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,730
and spread it evenly
on the deceased's chest.

128
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,990
Make it evener.

129
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,440
Take the steamed glutinous rice

130
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,340
and roll it into long strips.

131
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,710
Place it between the deceased's lips

132
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,550
and teeth.

133
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,670
Then use those tissues

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,410
to block the deceased's mouth,
ears, and nose.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Anything else?

136
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,540
Bring the boiled cotton wadding over,

137
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,340
and cover the brown rice.

138
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,430
Anything else?

139
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,190
No, just wait for the result.

140
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,000
In about 15 minutes,

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,850
you will know

142
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,100
if there is any problem.

143
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,670
I'm going out for some fresh air.

144
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,040
The vinegar's smell is killing me.

145
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
What about me?

146
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,560
You stay here and keep watch.

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,610
Call me when you get the result.

148
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,500
(Zhicheng Hall)

149
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,050
Captain Song,

150
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,810
I hope what I said

151
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,370
will be helpful to you.

152
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,610
Xiaohe, thank you.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,540
I should thank you all.

154
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,730
You work so hard to find out
the murderer.

155
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,410
I think

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,040
the leader and Xuanxue

157
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,050
in heaven

158
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,580
will rest in peace.

159
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,470
If there's nothing else,

160
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,460
I'll be leaving now.

161
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,590
Why are you here?

162
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,150
I've been watching you for a while,

163
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,410
but didn't want to disturb you.

164
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,760
What were you talking with her?

165
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,240
About how the opera troupe

166
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,140
traveled around.

167
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,930
This girl has had a tough time indeed.

168
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,440
Since she left her hometown
in Jianchuan,

169
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,370
she has never returned.

170
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Where is Huole?

171
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,660
It's just been a short time
since you met him last time.

172
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,860
Do you miss your good partner already?

173
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,330
I'm just worried if I don't keep an eye
on him,

174
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,810
he might get me into trouble.

175
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,360
I assigned him

176
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,290
a special task.

177
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,020
The time is almost up.

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,570
Why hasn't Xiaofan come back yet?

179
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,660
In broad daylight,

180
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,810
could it be a corpse coming to life?

181
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,290
The corpse comes to life!

182
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
The corpse comes to life!

183
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Xiaofan.

184
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,720
Xiaofan.

185
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,980
Quick, go check what's happening inside.

186
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,660
Let go of me!

187
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,860
The corpse comes to life!

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,900
You two, come in quickly!

189
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,750
Song He.

190
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
If you're scared,

191
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,480
then don't go in.

192
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,740
Who's scared?

193
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,510
What's going on?

194
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,570
Why does it smell so bad?

195
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,600
Congratulations.

196
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,560
Once again you've proven

197
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,990
that your persistence is correct.

198
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,450
Chen Shouting was indeed poisoned.

199
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,410
The culprit was really cunning.

200
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
This time,

201
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,030
he didn't mix the datura poison

202
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,870
into the water.

203
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,790
I think

204
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,160
the problem lies

205
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,330
in those two tonic pills.

206
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,620
He hid the poison in the tonic pills.

207
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,540
So after Chen Shouting took them,

208
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,350
even if I used the silver needle
to test his throat,

209
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,410
I couldn't find anything.

210
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,900
Why don't we discuss it outside?

211
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,260
(Death)

212
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,110
I propose

213
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,930
that we release Cheng Zhiyuan first.

214
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,510
But,

215
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,170
he's still the killer

216
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,090
and the prime suspect in this case.

217
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,760
I guess Huole is saying

218
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,880
that if we compare this case

219
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,380
to a locked room,

220
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,430
then Cheng Zhiyuan

221
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,090
is the key to unlocking this room.

222
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,750
The culprit.

223
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,690
I think I already know who it is.

224
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,210
But you, like me,

225
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,360
haven't figured out his motive yet.

226
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Right?

227
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,410
Is there any information
I haven't been updated on?

228
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,400
Releasing Cheng Zhiyuan

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,620
is such good news.

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,930
Why don't you tell Miss Xiaohe yourself?

231
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,030
Yeah.

232
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,310
Miss Xiaohe seems

233
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,240
quite interested in you.

234
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,980
Why don't you consider her?

235
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,750
Xiaofan.

236
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,410
How do you tell him to stop in English?

237
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,410
You are handsome.

238
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,630
You are handsome.

239
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,620
You're welcome.

240
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,540
(Zhicheng Hall)

241
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,500
Well,

242
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,680
this is my first time

243
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,980
playing Du Liniang.

244
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,450
So many things have happened.

245
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,210
You were so anxious
that your voice sounded hoarse.

246
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,050
Here, have some water.

247
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,680
Mao.

248
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,790
Chen.

249
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,740
Captain, why are you here?

250
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,860
Don't worry. He is locked up safely
inside.

251
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,210
- I'm here.
- Go.

252
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,240
Release Cheng Zhiyuan.

253
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,550
Captain, this...

254
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,390
I know what I'm doing.

255
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,540
Listen to the Captain.

256
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,210
Alright, I'll go release him.

257
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,380
Over the years,

258
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,690
Leader had always had you
play Chunxiang.

259
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,050
In your heart,

260
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,860
do you feel wronged?

261
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,860
How could I?

262
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,260
Xuanxue was naturally talented,

263
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,140
kind, and gentle.

264
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,900
She was undoubtedly the best choice
for Du Liniang.

265
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,540
Actually,

266
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,330
I always like you.

267
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,670
Of course I know that.

268
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,780
You have treated me well.

269
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,990
From now on,

270
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,570
I will take good care of you.

271
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,780
Uncle Xi,

272
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,090
I have always taken you as my family.

273
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,660
Uncle Xi, are you alright?

274
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm fine.

275
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,410
The cup fell to the ground.

276
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,410
Xiaohe. Xiaohe.

277
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,520
Captain Song, what...

278
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,690
What do you mean by this?

279
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,960
Miss Xiaohe,

280
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,030
are you alright?

281
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,390
Xiaohe.

282
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,910
You misunderstood.

283
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,990
- You misunderstood.
- Shut up.

284
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,050
Save it for the interrogation.

285
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,360
Captain Song.

286
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,320
How is she?

287
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,810
She hasn't woken up yet.

288
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,620
It should be that the drug hasn't
worn off yet.

289
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,540
Or maybe she was frightened.

290
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,990
Please have a seat.

291
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,790
Captain Song,

292
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,380
is there anything wrong?

293
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,570
Her makeup

294
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,620
seems different from the one on stage.

295
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,210
Right, this is not Chunxiang's makeup.

296
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,980
It's Du Liniang's.

297
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,630
Mr. Cheng,

298
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,170
I suddenly have a question for you.

299
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,090
Do you also think Miss Xiaohe

300
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,570
is not suitable to play Du Liniang?

301
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,030
That's not true.

302
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,570
It's Leader Chen who thought she's not.

303
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
Uncle Xi.

304
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,450
The situation is quite clear.

305
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,930
Do you have anything to say?

306
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,140
There's nothing to say.

307
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,150
Pay the debt

308
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,380
and pay the life for a life.

309
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,620
Before doing all this,

310
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,540
I had already thought

311
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,140
about that this day would come.

312
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,810
I'll go to my death

313
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,810
unflinchingly.

314
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,260
If that's the case,

315
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,910
then explain the specific details

316
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,690
of your crime.

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,740
Was it you who put the drug

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,990
in Cheng Zhiyuan's pear soup?

319
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,170
He put it in himself.

320
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,180
