=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 18=

2
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,020
Although Jingwen has literary talent,

3
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,750
he will never become

4
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,740
an outstanding novelist.

5
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,740
But I

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,850
am different.

7
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,770
Actually,

8
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,230
you have always been jealous
of Che Jingwen,

9
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,070
right?

10
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,220
You envy him

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,750
for not caring about the reputation

12
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,590
that you value so much.

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,660
You wanted to be friends with him,

14
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,850
but found that to him,

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,410
you were no different from others.

16
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,330
As his colleague,

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,920
I think,

18
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,640
when you were teaching

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,850
at Sicun Middle School,

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,740
the students liked him

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,770
far more than you, right?

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,580
So subconsciously,

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,780
defiling the mute girl

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,060
was just a way to get back
at Che Jingwen.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,540
And portraying him as a great hero

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,130
is a true reflection of your inner self,

27
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,550
because

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,820
compared to his noble character,

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,380
your despicable soul

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,690
is even fouler

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,410
and worse

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,010
than this low-quality coffee.

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,730
Mr. Qin,

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,010
even if you know the truth,

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,290
what can you do?

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,170
As long as you don't have
enough evidence,

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,690
you still can't do anything to me.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,030
I will still

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,410
be a novelist.

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,170
Moreover,

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,970
I have decided

42
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,780
to use this case as a blueprint

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,940
to write another novel

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
and then

45
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,570
make a fortune.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,130
Sir,

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,570
I am sorry.

48
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,690
Hello, Mao Shuai.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,130
Put Captain Song on the phone.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,060
You wanted to kill meand silence me.

51
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,520
Don't kill me.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,820
I don't want the money.
You can have it all.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Don't shoot.

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Where is the mute girl?

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,950
Tell us!

56
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,010
Captain Song,

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,340
I'm a prominent figure in Jiangzhou.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,580
You wouldn't dare shoot me.

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,670
I would.

60
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,810
Don't you like making up stories?

61
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,700
Today, I'll make one up for you.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,240
In a moment,

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,260
I will blow your head off

64
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,100
and hand the gun to your butler.

65
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,490
Then I'll make her testify

66
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,200
that out of greed, your butler

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,120
stole your money

68
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,290
and killed you to silence you.

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,720
Wanna bet?

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Don't shoot.

71
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,720
I'll tell you.

72
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,050
I'll tell you.

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Where is she?

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,480
Miss.

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Miss.

76
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,810
Miss, wake up.

77
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,190
Miss.

78
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,550
It's okay now.

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,170
We know it all.

80
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,630
It's over.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,410
My novel finally has a perfect ending.

82
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,760
This is completely

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,020
my novel.

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,320
Unfortunately, Jingwen

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,460
can never see it.

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,180
(Mr. Che Jingwen's Grave)

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,460
Did you ask her?

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,170
She wanted to stay

89
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,100
with Mr. Che.

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,930
A hundred novels

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,730
have a hundred endings.

92
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,340
If it were you,

93
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,670
how would you write it?

94
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,670
Me?

95
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,460
I wouldn't write a single word.

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,100
Without a beginning,

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,170
there will never be an end.

98
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,490
Forget about the novels.

99
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,610
We should be detectives like Cheng Sen

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,080
to bring hope

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,410
to people like the mute girl

102
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,550
and Mr. Che.

103
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,070
Look.

104
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,310
A rainbow.

105
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,100
- Yinyin.
- Yinyin.

106
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,540
- Yinyin.
- Stop.

107
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,660
If you dare take another step,

108
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,850
I'll blow her head off.

109
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,110
- Don't.
- Don't.

110
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,970
- Don't hurt Yinyin.
- Don't.

111
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,610
What do you want?

112
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,610
- Did you bring the ransom?
- I'll give you whatever you want.

113
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,290
Yes, I did.

114
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,470
This seems to be

115
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,490
more than 500 silver dollars.

116
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,520
(Wu Jia)

117
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,880
As long as you release my daughter,

118
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,050
you can have as much as you want.

119
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,970
Father, Mother, save me.

120
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Mr. He.

121
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,190
Do you know

122
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,050
why I asked you both to come
and ransom her personally?

123
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,660
Yinyin, right?

124
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,730
Now, I want you to make a choice.

125
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,020
Whomever you choose,

126
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,810
you can go home with him tonight.

127
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,290
The other one

128
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,740
will be handled by us.

129
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,500
Gentlemen.

130
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,260
I have no grievances or enmity with you.

131
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,930
No grievances or enmity?

132
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,810
Just take it as me enjoying this show.

133
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,150
Okay?

134
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,390
Brother!

135
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,150
Yinyin.

136
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,410
Are you choosing your father?

137
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,740
(Wu Yi)
Or are you choosing your mother?

138
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,380
I won't choose.

139
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,620
I won't choose.

140
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,020
You have five seconds.

141
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,930
If you still can't decide,

142
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,660
none of your family will survive.

143
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
Yinyin.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
Five.

145
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,170
Yinyin.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,240
Choose your mother.

147
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,830
Father, I won't choose.

148
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,670
Four.

149
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,520
No, no, choose your father.

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Three.

151
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Yinyin.

152
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,500
Choose your mother.

153
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
Two.

154
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,500
(Wu Bing)

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,760
One.

156
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,500
Mother!

157
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,500
(The three brothers. Beast walks alone,
while cattle and sheep flock.)

158
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
What's that sound?

159
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
It sounds like gunfire.

160
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,030
Yinyin!

161
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,740
Yinyin!

162
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
Don't move.

163
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,030
Hold your fire.

164
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,570
Listen up.

165
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,780
Put down your weapons.

166
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,930
Surrender and you won't be killed.

167
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
What should we do?

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,310
It's not the first time.
What are you afraid of?

169
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,150
Yes, yes.

170
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,450
You police listen up.

171
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,120
If you don't want to die,

172
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,210
then get out of here.

173
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,110
Open fire.

174
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,190
Kill these horrid men.

175
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,030
Shut up.

176
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,790
Go after them.

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,510
Shoot.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
Brother.

179
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,710
Retreat.

180
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,560
- Go.
- Hurry.

181
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,150
Quick, save them.

182
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,170
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,020
Back in the day,

184
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,260
Jiangzhou was plagued by bandits.

185
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Especially the water bandits

186
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,690
that haunted the Qianjiang River.

187
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,270
They committed all sorts of atrocities.

188
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,980
The police station
established a patrol team for it.

189
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,570
I was appointed the captain.

190
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,930
That night, I encountered
the Wu brothers

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,810
purely by chance.

192
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,600
However,

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,780
my promotion to the director
of the police station

194
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,620
was somehow

195
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,330
related to this coincidence.

196
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,840
Because you saved

197
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,860
He Lingyu and his wife, right?

198
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,980
When Commander Lei started his uprising,

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,640
He Lingyu provided substantial support

200
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,540
to Lei's Army.

201
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,050
When they took control of Jiangzhou,

202
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,020
Mr. He recommended me to Commander Lei.

203
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,400
After becoming the director,

204
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,310
I also sent people

205
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,090
to track down the three brothers.

206
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,690
But there was no news.

207
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,260
I didn't expect that after so many years,

208
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,450
they would appear again.

209
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,910
Director.

210
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,210
Who did they kidnap this time?

211
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,410
He Lingyu's other daughter.

212
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,690
Her name is Niannian.

213
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,640
She is only six years old.

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,480
Seven years ago,

215
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,090
the three brothers killed her sister.

216
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,410
And now they kidnap her.

217
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
Director Xu,

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,790
are you sure they haven't committed
any other crimes

219
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,140
in these past few years?

220
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,860
Definitely not in Jiangzhou.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,190
I have also checked

222
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,120
the neighboring counties.

223
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,090
No similar cases.

224
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,500
But seven years ago,

225
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,570
before the three brothers killed Yinyin,

226
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,780
they had committed two other kidnaps.

227
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,540
Hu Asheng, male, 12 years old.

228
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,720
On June 18th, seven years ago,

229
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,000
Hu Asheng was kidnapped.

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,690
According to Hu Asheng's parents,

231
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,360
the three brothers

232
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,090
demanded a ransom
of three Mexican silver dollars.

233
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,270
They insisted that both parents

234
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,410
come together to pay the ransom.

235
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,860
Another victim

236
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,930
named Bai Xiaoyan,

237
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
was 14 years old.

238
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,190
The three brothers

239
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,240
also demanded that her parents

240
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,290
come together to pay the ransom.

241
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,360
However, the ransom they asked for

242
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,330
was 20 Mexican silver dollars.

243
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,480
Director Xu,

244
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,950
what is the social relationship

245
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,790
among the victims?

246
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,330
And what about their relationship
with the He family?

247
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,410
The three victims

248
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,000
include a male and two females.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,810
They lived in different places
and were from different social classes.

250
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,540
Their backgrounds have nothing in common.

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,930
Maybe they

252
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,740
really chose random victims.

253
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,090
Your doubt is the same as mine.

254
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,510
By the way,

255
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,810
early this morning,

256
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,170
Commander Lei called me.

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,860
Hello.

258
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,360
- Xu Wuwen!
- Hello, Commander.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
How are you doing

260
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,400
as the director?

261
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,390
It's been seven years,

262
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,910
and you still haven't caught the criminals.

263
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,950
And now these people

264
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,900
have kidnapped He's second daughter.

265
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,290
Why are they

266
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,290
targeting He alone?

267
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
Such a thing happened

268
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,950
right under my nose.

269
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,910
How can I face He

270
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,380
in the future?

271
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm telling you all,

272
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,410
you must catch the criminals
as soon as possible,

273
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,500
find the child, and bring her back.

274
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,260
Do you hear me?

275
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,810
He Lingyu and his wife

276
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,210
have never recovered
from the grief of losing Yinyin.

277
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,810
Now Niannian is kidnapped.

278
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,260
This incident

279
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,210
has devastated the couple.

280
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,390
Director, rest assured.

281
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,900
We will solve the case
as soon as possible

282
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,150
and bring Niannian back.
