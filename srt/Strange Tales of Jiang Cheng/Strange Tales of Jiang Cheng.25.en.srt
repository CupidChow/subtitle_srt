=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 25=

2
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,330
But what have you done to your best friend?

3
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,470
A total of 32 boxes

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,890
of top-quality opium.

5
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,480
You know all my assets

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,410
are tied up in this.

7
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,560
You ordered them

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,460
to be sunk into the river.

9
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,280
Do you know how much salt
we need to trade

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,740
to make up for this treasure?

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,240
Zhuang,

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,250
Come on, calm down.

13
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,870
When you first asked me to partner up,

14
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,970
I've told you

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,770
we can't touch opium.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,540
Your father is the director
of the Jiangzhou Police Station,

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,220
Lei Hai's confidant.

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,120
In Jiangzhou,

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,030
who dares to point fingers at you?

20
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,130
I just don't understand
what you're afraid of.

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,620
Zhuang,

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,410
we are friends

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,540
and brothers,

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,850
so I'm sincerely advising you

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,410
that we can make money,

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,400
but opium is harmful.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,730
So we can't touch it.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,290
The girls in Huanyinglou

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
laugh and chat with you every day.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,470
They are flattering you

31
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,680
and are grateful to you.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,660
Do you really think
you're a perfect man?

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,800
If your father weren't

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,030
the director of the police station,

35
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,900
do you think they would even
look at you?

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,780
Since we can't agree with each other,

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,620
let's talk on another day.

38
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,540
I'll ask you one last time.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you discarding

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,130
our friendship?

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,970
Will you just sink the opium

42
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,410
once I try to sell it?

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,010
You may sell opiumin Jiangzhou

44
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,820
over my dead body.

45
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,690
Mr. Xu,

46
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,540
I was just checking

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,900
if you need anything else here.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,060
Mr. Xu,

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,820
are you done with your business?

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Do you

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,120
want me

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
to call the girls back

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,060
to drink with you?

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
No.

55
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,250
I want to be alone for a while.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,540
(Room Qingguifang)

57
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,900
Mr. Xu,

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,470
Madam Rong wants me to ask

59
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,290
if you plan to stay the night here.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,830
I will stay with you tonight.

61
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,670
Is that alright?

62
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,460
Mr. Xu,

63
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,700
are you asleep?

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,930
Mr. Xu?

65
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,820
(Badger enchantment. It is better
to burn brightly than wither.)

66
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,580
Someone's dead.

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,420
A big shot.

68
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,180
(Huanyinglou)

69
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,140
(Room Qingguifang)
Someone's dead.

70
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,730
The man could just kill him.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,360
How deep will the hatred be

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,990
to make him peel off
the victim's facial skin?

73
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,730
- It's terrifying.
- I wonder who did it.

74
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,190
Captain,

75
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,360
it seems that no debt is worse
than a love debt.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,930
- Watch your mouth.
- I'm serious.

77
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,030
Captain, you don't know.

78
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,910
Mr. Xu

79
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,400
was a famous playboy in Jiangzhou.

80
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,150
There were countless rumors
about his love affairs.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,220
Xu Shenxing had a strong smell

82
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,260
of alcohol on him.

83
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,940
He must have been attacked from behind

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,220
while drunk.

85
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
The murder weapon was a sharp dagger

86
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,740
which pierced through his entire chest.

87
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
There were no extra wounds
around his face,

88
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,740
which indicates

89
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,500
that the facial skin was peeled off
after he died.

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,260
Otherwise, if he had struggled,

91
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,540
there would have

92
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,660
been some marks left.

93
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,980
Mao,

94
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,740
go interrogate everyone at Huanyinglou.

95
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,140
Their madam, the singing girls,

96
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,220
servants, and waiters.

97
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Don't leave anyone out.

98
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,860
Check if anyone has seen this doll.

99
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,540
And, find out whom Xu Shenxing met

100
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,380
before his death,

101
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,540
and if there were any new faces

102
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,380
that came to Huanyinglou.

103
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,700
Committing a crime in such a place,

104
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,180
they must have left some clues.

105
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,320
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,860
Chen.

107
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,660
- Captain.
- Go tell Director Xu.

108
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,700
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,580
Watch your words.

110
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,220
Also, find out

111
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,860
if anything unusual has happened
at Xu Residence

112
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,140
in the past few days.

113
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,560
- The more details, the better.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,340
Director Xu's son

116
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,660
was killed at Huanyinglou at midnight.

117
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
Thank you.

119
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,540
Director Xu's son

120
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,740
(Jiangzhou Police Station)
was killed at Huanyinglou at midnight.

121
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,700
I only have one son.

122
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,140
Who killed him?

123
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,700
Who?

124
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,180
Director.

125
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,540
Don't worry.

126
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,620
Song He and Huole

127
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,620
will definitely find out the truth

128
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,260
and seek justice for Shenxing.

129
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,020
Shenxing.

130
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,300
Shenxing.

131
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,700
Huole.

132
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,220
(Xu Shenxing Case)

133
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,060
You've made tea?

134
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,900
How did you know
we were coming to you?

135
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,500
We are partners.

136
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,700
A murder happened here.

137
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,580
If you don't come to me,
who else would you go to?

138
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,220
Alright, tell me.

139
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,780
On the 18th of this month, at 8 p.m.,

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,980
Xu Shenxing, Director Xu's only son,

141
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,300
arrived at Huanyinglou by carriage.

142
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,340
According to our investigation,

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,380
shortly after Xu Shenxing
entered Room Qingguifang,

144
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,100
his business partner

145
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,020
Zhuang Si, the general manager
of Zhuang's Trading Company

146
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,060
came to the appointment.

147
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,340
(Xu Shenxing. Zhuang Si.)

148
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,300
Later, the singing girl Yinshuang

149
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
heard Xu Shenxing

150
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,620
and Zhuang Si

151
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,700
arguing over opium in the room.

152
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
And they parted on bad terms.

153
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,300
Additionally, Gu Sui,
the guard of Huanyinglou,

154
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,140
witnessed

155
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
that on the night of the murder,

156
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,980
he saw a suspicious stranger

157
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,020
who wore a silver ring
on his pinkie finger.

158
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,220
Later, when he was patrolling
the second floor,

159
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,620
he saw that person again.

160
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,220
And he seemed to know Zhuang Si.

161
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,780
Based on this, I have a good reason to suspect

162
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,720
that this stranger who had
a black mole on his right cheek

163
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,300
and wore a silver ring
on his left pinkie finger

164
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,060
is the murderer

165
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,180
hired by Zhuang Si

166
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,300
to kill Xu Shenxing.

167
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,580
(Huanyinglou. Xu Shenxing. Zhuang Si.)

168
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,780
(Facial skin peeled off.)

169
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,780
(Huanyinglou)

170
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,860
I believe Xu Shenxing's death

171
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,740
has nothing to do

172
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,140
with the presumptive murderer.

173
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,860
A hired murderer's task

174
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,780
is to kill,

175
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,940
which means to take somebody's life,

176
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,780
and that's all.

177
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,300
But in reality,

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,260
(Facial skin peeled off.)

179
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,140
the victim's facial skin
was peeled off.

180
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,420
Just think about it,

181
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,220
it is not like peeling an orange.

182
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,180
It takes a lot of time.

183
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,860
Especially in Huanyinglou,

184
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,380
where there are many singing girls

185
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,600
and guests walking around every day.

186
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,900
If it weren't for a psychological need,

187
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,900
no one would take such a risk.

188
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
So,

189
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,020
the murderer must have had a deep hatred
for the victim.

190
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,180
If that's the case,

191
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,460
the method is not right.

192
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,300
Actually, before you arrived,

193
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,420
I had already spoken with Xiaofan.

194
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,420
The murderer peeled off
the victim's facial skin

195
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,540
after he had died.

196
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,660
If it was purely out of hatred,

197
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,980
it would make more sense
if he did it before he died.

198
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,020
That way, it would cause the victim

199
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,220
the greatest amount of pain.

200
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,580
Right?

201
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,340
Absolutely right.

202
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,500
I think Detective Qin's analysis

203
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,700
is particularly spot on.

204
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,220
Captain, what do you think?

205
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,020
What if Zhuang Si hired the murderer

206
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,990
and took it as a smokescreen?

207
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,380
I don't think so.

208
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,020
When I was in the United Kingdom,

209
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,540
I reviewed a case

210
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,660
called the Whitechapel Murders.

211
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,820
The murderer was known as Jack the Ripper,

212
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,860
who had removed the victims' uterus.

213
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,620
My understanding is,

214
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,420
he wanted those women

215
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,900
to lose their sexual capability

216
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,340
and gender identity.

217
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,620
So in this case,

218
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,940
I think

219
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,860
that the murderer wanted the victim

220
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,300
to lose his real identity.

221
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,820
In other words,

222
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,620
the murderer wanted to create
a sense of estrangement

223
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,220
between himself and the victim.

224
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,020
You mean

225
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,180
the murderer and the victim
were acquaintances?

226
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,540
I tend to support this conclusion.

227
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,900
Tell me,

228
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,500
besides the lead on Zhuang Si,

229
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,020
do you have any other findings?

230
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,460
The clue

231
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,780
was provided by Cao,

232
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,900
the butler at the Xu Residence.

233
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,940
(To Xu Shenxing)
He said that on the 17th,

234
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,900
the night before the murder,

235
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,340
a rickshaw puller

236
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,940
(Xu Shenxing's life is in danger.)
delivered a ransom letter for someone.

237
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,420
You must have heard

238
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,300
about Mr. Xu's affairs.

239
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,380
Many people want to extort him.

240
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,140
So I'm not surprised

241
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,300
by such letters at all.

242
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,980
Moreover, at that time,

243
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,380
Mr. Xu was also at home.

244
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,160
So I didn't pay much attention to it.

245
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,780
Can you still recall
what that rickshaw puller

246
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,620
looked like?

247
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,860
However,

248
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,780
I do remember
which rickshaw company he was from.

249
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,860
Which one?

250
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,820
The Du's.

251
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,900
If we catch that rickshaw puller,

252
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,520
we can find out where the letter
came from.

253
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,900
The rickshaw puller has been caught.

254
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,220
- We also found out who wrote the letter.
- Who is it?

255
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,740
A scribe named Shen Yuan.

256
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,100
A scribe?

257
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,060
Yes, someone who writes
letters and contracts

258
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,740
for illiterate people.

259
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,220
No wonder the handwriting
was so beautiful.

260
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,900
Where is he?

261
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,820
He's missing.

262
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,580
Missing.

263
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,780
Missing...

264
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,420
(Huanyang)

265
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,300
Tell me about her.

266
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,100
The singing girl Huanyang.

267
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,260
A year ago,

268
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,060
she and Xu Shenxing were in love.

269
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,260
According to the guard Gu Sui
from Huanyinglou,

270
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,180
he once saw the doll

271
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,860
found at the crime scene.

272
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,700
I saw this doll,

273
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,380
in Miss Huanyang's room.

274
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,140
It's hers.

275
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,660
Where is Miss Huanyang?

276
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,740
About a year ago,

277
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,820
she was expelled from Huanyinglou.

278
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,300
Expelled? Why?

279
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,220
Originally, she was favored by Mr. Xu

280
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,780
who wanted to bring her
into the Xu Residence.

281
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,820
But due to some circumstances,

282
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,620
it didn't happen.

283
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,900
In a fit of anger, Miss Huanyang

284
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,060
picked up

285
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,220
badger enchantment skills.

286
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,540
But her plot was exposed,

287
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,980
and she got expelled from Huanyinglou.

288
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,100
So where is she now?

289
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,340
The southern suburbs.

290
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,140
Badger enchantment?

291
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,740
Alright.

292
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
I'll follow Shen Yuan's clue.

293
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
Leave Zhuang Si to me

294
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,340
Mao. Chen.

295
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,540
You two go to Huanyinglou again

296
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,820
to see if there are any clues we missed.

297
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
- Yes, sir.
- After it is done,

298
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,940
we'll meet at the old house
in the southern suburbs.

299
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,780
Move out.

300
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,020
Please.

(Letter Writing Service)

302
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,180
When did you

303
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,980
rent this house to Shen Yuan?

304
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
About

305
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,780
five or six years ago.

306
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,260
How long has he been a scribe?

307
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,020
Well,

308
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,980
I can't quite remember.

309
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,460
Anyway, the people living nearby

310
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,700
all go to him when they need

311
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,820
to write a letter or something.

312
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,060
He's gentle

313
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,900
and patient.

314
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,700
And, he charges a small fee.

315
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,500
If someone is short on money,

316
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,620
he'll do it on credit.

317
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,820
Has he always lived alone?

318
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
Always alone.

319
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,740
Sir. Sir!

320
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,620
Mr. Zhuang really isn't here today.

(Monday, August 19th, Jushangfang.)

323
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,940
When was the last time

324
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,740
you saw him?

325
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,860
Maybe it was the day before yesterday,

326
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,620
or maybe not.

327
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
He's the kind of person

328
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,700
who doesn't talk much.

329
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,900
We just nodded to greet each other
when we met.

330
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,860
So, I didn't pay much attention.

331
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,860
Please, don't look at me like that.

332
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,140
It's not just me.

333
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,820
You can ask the neighbors.

334
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,340
Their answer will be the same as mine.

335
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
How about these people?

336
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,060
They're the girls from Huanyinglou.

337
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,140
They also came to him
for letter writing?

338
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,620
Because it's close.

339
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,500
At the end of this alley,

340
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,820
it's Huanyinglou's rear wall.
