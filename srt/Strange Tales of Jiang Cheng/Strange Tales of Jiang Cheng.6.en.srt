2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,220
(Governor's Mansion)

3
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,190
Please.

4
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,640
Come.

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,890
Father.

6
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,080
I brought Huole and Captain Song

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
here.

8
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,170
- Commander Lei.
- Hello, Commander.

9
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,280
Come and sit, you two.

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,970
Make yourselves at home.

11
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,030
There's tea here.

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,690
What are you doing?

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,770
Don't be so strict.

14
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,830
They saved your life.

15
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,840
You must repay their kindness.

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,770
I am a man of reason.

17
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,970
I'm clear about love and hate.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,770
Tonight

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,170
I will host a banquet

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,800
to properly entertain you

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,080
to express my gratitude.

22
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,710
Father.

23
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,240
We won't stay for dinner.

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,680
But you can borrow us

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,890
the screen wall in the backyard.

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,010
What screen wall?

27
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,400
The wall in our backyard

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
where the body was found.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,110
Mr. Qin wants to re-investigate

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,170
the human clock case.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
Mr. Qin is Huole,

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
the one who saved your life.

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
His father is now

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,730
a suspect in the human clock case.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
My father is innocent.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,320
Commander Lei.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,770
This case was already closed.

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
We shouldn't bother you again.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
But,

40
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,240
we need to re-investigate now,

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,890
so we need to look at the crime scene.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Alright.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
I understand.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
You saved me.

45
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,640
I must repay this favor.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
How about this?

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,870
I'll call the police station later,

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,960
and have them release your father.

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
Wouldn't that okay?

50
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,920
Why re-investigate?

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
That's too troublesome.

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Commander.

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,920
I appreciate your kindness.

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,520
But the law is not a joke.

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,710
I...

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
A joke?

57
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,080
In Jiangzhou, I am the sky.

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,120
My words are the imperial edict.

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,730
Jiangzhou belongs to you.

60
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,330
But it also belongs to the people.

61
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,800
Law is the balance

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,030
between you and the people.

63
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,480
As long as the law is in people's hearts,

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,050
you will be invincible.

65
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,330
What does he mean?

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,520
He is praising you

67
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,080
as invincible.

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't misinterpret it.

69
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,530
So, after all that talk,

70
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,730
you two didn't understand a word?

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,430
Forget it, forget it.

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,870
What screen wall?

73
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,960
You take them there.

74
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Investigate thoroughly.

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,480
Understood.

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
Thanks, Commander.

77
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,490
Let's go, follow me.

78
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,670
This way.

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,080
Invincible.

80
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,990
Gentlemen,

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
this is the place.

82
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
Miss, I have other business...

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,850
Go ahead, I don't need you here.

84
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,110
Yes!

85
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
I believe

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,120
the murderer embedded the body
in the screen wall

87
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,880
not to hide it,

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
but quite the opposite,

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,650
to ensure the body would be discovered.

90
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,920
In all my years as a police officer,

91
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,390
I've never seen a murderer who,

92
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,270
doesn't want to conceal it,

93
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,730
and even fears others won't find out.

94
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,090
I just measured the height at both ends.

95
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,360
The left side

96
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,470
is eight centimeters higher
than the right side.

97
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,730
This could cause the foundation to settle,

98
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,000
and cracks in the wall,

99
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,190
to expose the body.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Obviously,

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,730
the craftsman,

102
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,290
or the murderer,

103
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,000
did it deliberately.

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,490
That's a bit far-fetched, isn't it?

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,210
What if it's due to the terrain,

106
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
or

107
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,910
the craftsman's poor skills?

108
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,120
The soil in Jiangzhou is dry,

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,440
so the foundation rarely collapses.

110
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,510
Moreover,

111
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,560
this is renovating

112
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,440
Commander Lei's residence.

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,050
The craftsmen should be top-notch.

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,920
How could they make
such a basic mistake?

115
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,560
I think Mr. Qin's analysis

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,090
makes a lot of sense.

117
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,430
Xiaofan,

118
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,090
do you also think I arrested
the wrong person?

119
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
Captain Song,

120
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm not questioning your ability.

121
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,000
Because the evidence was conclusive,

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,150
and Lawyer Qin had confessed,

123
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,440
so there was no need
to bring it up again.

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
But in this case,

125
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,730
based on my autopsy results,

126
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,270
there are indeed some aspects

127
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,110
worth reconsidering.

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
What aspects?

129
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,310
Tell me.

130
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,360
When Zhu Gengsheng, Xiao Qiance.

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,470
and Fat Jin were killed,

132
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,440
it was a single fatal stab.

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
Clean and decisive.

134
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,240
The wounds were distributed

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,830
on the chest, back, and neck.

136
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,680
But apart from that,

137
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,560
there were no other knife wounds
on the body,

138
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,000
not even a scratch.

139
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,970
Based on my experience,

140
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,400
generally speaking,

141
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,790
when the victim sees the killer

142
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,730
wielding a knife,

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,230
they would definitely resist.

144
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,560
There should be external injuries,

145
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,920
especially on the hands.

146
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,970
The three victims knew the killer.

147
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,960
The victims never thought

148
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
the killer would murder them.

149
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,640
So it is normal that they didn't resist.

150
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,920
Even so,

151
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,880
the killer's knife skills and strength

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
had to be very precise.

153
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,850
My dad couldn't do that.

154
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,080
My dad's right hand
was severely injured.

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,300
He couldn't even cut fruit properly.

156
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,290
But the knife wounds on the victims

157
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,800
were all caused by the right hand.

158
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,710
Assuming they knew my dad,

159
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,550
didn't resist,

160
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,850
and stood there to be stabbed,

161
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,730
it still wouldn't be a single fatal stab.

162
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,710
Then why doesn't Lawyer Qin
say it himself?

163
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,650
So,

164
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,090
there must be more to this.

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,440
Was Tuo Hailin really poisoned to death?

166
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,290
He was poisoned before death.

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
His body had been dark blue-black

168
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,470
for many days.

169
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,310
It also turned black.

170
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,550
If it had been a long time,

171
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,000
the flesh would have decayed
to the bone,

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
and the bones would be dark black.

173
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,760
The autopsy confirmed all this.

174
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,430
So,

175
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
the conclusion is?

176
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,600
He undoubtedly died from poisoning.

177
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,610
- But...
- Are you trying to say,

178
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,320
is it possible that the victim

179
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,650
was poisoned after death?

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
That's impossible.

181
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,120
If it were as you said,

182
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
the color of his bones

183
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,520
wouldn't be dark blue-black,

184
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,360
but yellow-white.

185
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,390
I personally

186
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,520
examined Tuo Hailin's body.

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,440
I saw it very clearly.

188
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,520
There is absolutely no mistake.

189
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,490
If that's the case,

190
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,970
I deduce there are
only two possibilities.

191
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,160
First.

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
The person who killed Zhu Gengsheng,

193
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,880
Xiao Qiance, and Pang Jin,

194
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
is just an imitator.

195
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,070
After Tuo Hailin's body

196
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,910
was exposed,

197
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,270
he deliberately framed

198
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,610
the murderer of Tuo Hailin,

199
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so he could escape punishment.

200
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,170
Second. The murderer

201
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,310
is the same person.

202
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,030
He is not only skilled with a knife,

203
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,400
but also capable of poisoning.

204
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
Therefore,

205
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,970
his profession

206
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,410
should be a military camp instructor,

207
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,630
bodyguard,

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
bandit,

209
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,990
cook,

210
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,850
or Western doctor.

211
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Of course,

212
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,050
we cannot easily rule out

213
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,210
other related professions.

214
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,090
Among the professions mentioned,

215
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,490
lawyer is not included.

216
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,170
But why did Lawyer Qin confess?

217
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
Is he covering for the murderer?

218
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,950
If Lawyer Qin is determined

219
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,880
not to speak,

220
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,090
what should we do?

221
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,530
I have a simple and direct method,

222
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,000
I hope you can agree.

223
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,740
(Jiangzhou Prison)

224
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Qin Weilian.

225
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,360
Here.

226
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,520
Go to hell.

227
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,980
(Jiangzhou Prison)

228
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,880
So your idea is to see Qin Weilian?

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
If he were going to tell the truth,

230
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
he would have said it long ago.

231
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,070
I am the catalyst

232
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,330
that can make my father talk.

233
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,130
Where is Qin Weilian?

234
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,520
Just now, he...

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
- Dad!
- You...

236
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
What's going on?

237
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,910
Captain Song.

238
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
Dad.

239
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,880
I still need to clear your name.

240
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,280
How could you just leave like this?

241
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,210
I'm sorry, Dad.

242
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,430
You worked so hard

243
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,280
to send me abroad to study law,

244
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
but I secretly studied psychology.

245
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,760
You were wrongfully imprisoned,

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,000
and I couldn't clear your name.

247
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,360
I came too late.

248
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,240
I couldn't do anything for you.

249
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
I am not filial.

250
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,560
Huole.

251
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Dad,

252
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,970
you're not dead.

253
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,880
That person bribed the prison guards,

254
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,730
trying to kill me.

255
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,030
Qin Weilian.

256
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,990
Here.

257
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,150
Dad.

258
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,240
Fortunately, Captain Chen
arrived in time.

259
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,990
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have been able to see you.

260
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,720
Alright, alright.

261
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,690
I'm fine.

262
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,930
You rascal, I haven't asked you yet.

263
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,840
Why did you give up law,

264
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,730
to study psychology?

265
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,520
I found it more interesting.

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Well, that's good.

267
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
As long as you complete your studies,

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
it would mean you haven't let me down.

269
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,210
I didn't.

270
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,270
I was just reading detective novels.

271
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,760
I didn't get the diploma.

272
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,630
You...

273
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,360
You...

274
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,570
You, you rascal!

275
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,560
Officer Chen.

276
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,730
- Take me back to the cell.
- Dad.

277
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,280
Dad, don't be angry. Dad!

278
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,600
Captain Song.

279
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,450
Why did that person want to kill my dad?

280
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,200
Tuo Hailin

281
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
is his father.

282
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,270
Dad,

283
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,610
just tell me the truth.

284
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,280
Who is the real killer?

285
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,490
Isn't he sitting right in front of you?

286
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,330
I want to hear the truth.

287
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,070
There are only a few days
before execution.

288
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,910
There's no time left.

289
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,120
Didn't you just send me off?

290
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,000
Your heartfelt words to me,

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,840
I heard them too.

292
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,480
Huole,

293
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,000
you make me proud, son.

294
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,450
You must walk the road yourself.

295
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,330
I have only one request.

296
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
Go back to Europe,

297
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,640
or go to Shanghai.

298
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,910
In any case,

299
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
leave Jiangzhou.

300
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm not going anywhere.

301
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,810
I just want to see,

302
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,830
this heartless father of mine.

303
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,400
Who exactly are you protecting,

304
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,810
that you don't even want your own son?

305
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,040
Sometimes,

306
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,690
the truth is not as you wish.

307
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,360
My life,

308
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,090
under your arrangements,

309
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,850
has never been as I wished.

310
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,810
When I was young,
I loved Jiangzhou so much,

311
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,280
but you insisted on
sending me to Shanghai.

312
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,310
You said it was for my own good.

313
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,730
That I could learn English in Shanghai.

314
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,330
But what was the result?

315
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,680
I didn't even get to see my mom

316
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,160
one last time.

317
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,400
At 16,

318
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,930
I returned to Jiangzhou,

319
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,210
thinking we could reunite,

320
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,950
but you gave me

321
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,610
a ticket to England.

322
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,810
I don't like to study law.

323
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,000
You insist that I should be a lawyer.

324
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,070
I just want to live a comfortable life.

325
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,360
But you tell me
that I shouldn't be too complacent.

326
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,930
In my opinion,

327
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,400
you sent me away

328
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,560
just so you could

329
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
live more comfortably.

330
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,360
How could I be doing it for myself?

331
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Then tell me.

332
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,330
Who was that woman at home back then?

333
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,710
Were you trying to

334
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,610
be with her,

335
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,210
so you kept sending me away?

336
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,790
What woman?

337
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,330
I saw it all.

338
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
In the study room,

339
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,210
she threw herself at you.

340
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Stop talking.

341
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,030
You saw it wrong.

342
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
Wiping hands.

343
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Unusual speed.

344
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
Suddenly sweating.

345
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,830
From the perspective of

346
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,810
behaviorism's core view,

347
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,070
these are all your body's

348
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,190
natural instinctive reactions

349
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,210
to external stimuli.

350
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,630
This proves

351
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,640
that I hit the truth
you were trying to hide.

352
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,480
Nonsense!

353
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,320
Captain Song.

354
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,720
Take him away.

355
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,120
I don't want to see him again.

356
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,790
Dad.

357
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,760
You are definitely not the murderer.

358
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
No matter why you want

359
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,570
to die in place of the murderer.

360
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,610
I will definitely save you.

361
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,690
Not just for you,

362
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,280
but also for the law of Jiangzhou.

363
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,930
Those who commit crimes

364
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,570
should be punished.

365
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,440
Here.

366
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,240
What is this?

367
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,600
Sugarcane juice.

368
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,790
You've been shouting for so long.

369
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,210
Moisten your throat.

370
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,720
Thank you.

371
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,440
You just said

372
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,850
your dad's woman, where does she live?

373
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,720
Are you crazy?

374
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,790
You're the one who's crazy.

375
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,240
Who told you my dad has a woman?

376
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,150
Didn't you say it?

377
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,070
In your study room.

378
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,030
She threw herself at your dad.

379
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,070
You don't understand anything.

380
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,450
My dad only loves my mom.

381
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,270
Alright, alright.

382
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,800
Whoever your dad likes

383
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,930
has nothing to do with me.

384
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,950
I just want to know

385
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,270
who that woman is.

386
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,610
What does she have to do with this case?

387
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Lawyer Qin,

388
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,210
I know this isn't easy.

389
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,280
I have nothing to thank you for.

390
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,610
You mean,

391
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,880
whenever that woman is mentioned,

392
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,280
Qin Weilian becomes nervous?

393
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,850
So that woman,

394
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,610
is related to your dad's confession?

395
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,570
Your dad is covering for her?

396
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,870
No,

397
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,280
my dad gets nervous,

398
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
not entirely because of that woman,

399
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,360
but because I mentioned the study room.

400
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
The study room?

401
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,450
My dad is a lawyer.

402
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,000
He does a lot of preparation work
for each case.

403
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,270
So,

404
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
in his study room,

405
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,810
you can find what's on his mind.

406
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,400
That book on the human body clock.

407
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,520
It was placed there deliberately.

408
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,990
Where are you going?

409
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,450
To your study room to find clues.

410
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
Captain Song,

411
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,760
I can go back

412
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,070
and look for clues at my house.

413
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,910
As for you,

414
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,930
you have a more important task now.

415
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,970
The truth is still unclear.

416
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,470
I don't know if anyone else

417
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,600
will try to assassinate my dad.

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,990
So you need to go to the prison
immediately,

419
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,990
and have Captain Chen

420
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,040
move my dad to a safer place.

421
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,880
Do you understand?

422
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,750
Understood.

423
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,880
No,

424
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
why are you ordering me around?

425
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,650
You are a detective.

426
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,450
Protecting the wrongfully accused

427
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,760
is your responsibility.

428
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,340
(Qin's Study Room)

429
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,560
(As a lawyer)

430
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,370
(what he cares about most)

431
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,650
(is undoubtedly his study room.)

432
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,160
(Because here)

433
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,750
(lies)

434
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,890
(his deepest logic.)

435
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,370
(I need to get close to him,)

436
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,970
(become him,)

437
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,040
(and use his logic
to solve his problems.)

438
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,130
(What clues did I miss?)
