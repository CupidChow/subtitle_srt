00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,280
Jiangzhou is surrounded
by mountains and waters.

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,710
It is located at a strategic point
in the southwestern frontier.

4
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,320
In the early years
of the Republic of China,

5
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,200
strange cases frequently occurred.

Announcement.

21
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,590
Qin Weilian is the murderer

22
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,870
of killing Tuo Hailin.

23
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,000
(Qin Residence)
Qin imitated Western witchcraft

24
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,310
to create a human body clock.

25
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,960
The detective squad conducted
a thorough investigation

26
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,310
Qin knew his scandal
would eventually be exposed,

27
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,270
and he could not escape.

28
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,150
(Soul Sealing Jar)
In a fit of rage and shame,

29
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,120
he targeted those
who had wronged him in the past.

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,640
(Zhu Gengsheng)
He ruthlessly killed Jin Pang,

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,030
Xiao Qiance,

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,820

However,

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,870
(Jin Pang)
justice has long arms.

35
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,680
In Qin's study room,

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,470
we found a book documenting

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,430
Western witchcraft.

38
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
The criminal evidence was conclusive.

39
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,560
Qin Weilian confessed.

40
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,430
Three months later, Qin Weilian

41
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,030
would be executed by shooting

42
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,960
to serve as a warning to others.

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,540
(Jiangzhou High Court)

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
What time is it?

45
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,800
Five minutes to ten.

46
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,220
Only handcuffs

47
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,390
can make such a dull
and uninteresting sound.

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,160
Am I right, officer?

49
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,750
What did he steal?

50
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
That person sitting at the end
of the corridor,

51
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,030
and wearing a hat.

52
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,270
What did he steal?

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,390
When a mouse

54
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,560
feels nervous,

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,830
it would look around like that.

56
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,300
A thief

57
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,630
more or less gives himself

58

psychological hints,

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
even if he doesn't realize it.

60
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,270
Am I right?

61
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,710
What else did you notice?

62
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,130
Just like you sitting here

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
to better observe the target,

64
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,040
he sits there

65
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
to better guard

66
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,950
what he cares about.

67
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,040
(Cheng Tianlang, Thief)
So, I'm more inclined to believe

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,720
(Public Toilet)
that he hid the stolen goods in the toilet.

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,070
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Huole.

70
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,660
I just returned from my study abroad.

71
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,220
(Qin Huole, Psychological analyst)

72
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Listen up.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,900
One in the fourth row on the left,

74
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,600
one in the fifth row on the right,

75
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,270
and two in the second-to-last row.

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,720
If you are confident
you can handle all five on your own,

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,660
then ignore what I said.

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,710
Thanks.

79
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,270
I'd better hide.

80
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,750
Where did he hide it?

81
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,460
He's out.

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,830
- Who is that?
- No idea.

83
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,020
(Jiangzhou Police Station)
Detective squad on the case.

84
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,680

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,830
Police.

86
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,230
The stolen goods are here.

87
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,120
The Flying Wheel Gang stole these.

88
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,360
Everyone, report what you lost

89
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,040
and go to the police station
to claim it.

90
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,680
Where's my money? My money is missing.

91
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,800
I lost five silver dollars.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
- Where are the silver dollars?
- Disgusting thieves!

93
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,950
They stole my gold chain!

94
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,240
That's the only valuable thing in my family.

95
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
I also lost ten dollars.

96
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,350
Help me find it.

97
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,520
Here it is.

98
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,750
- Hurry up.
- Be gentle.

99
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,240
Kid, I will remember you.

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Move.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,970
I'm Song He,

102
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,410
captain of the detective squad.

104

Captain Song.

105
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,200
Actually, I have always been interested

106
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,170
in investigating cases.

107
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,350
Are you in need of
a psychological analyst?

108
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,190
I'm your guy.

109
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,120
The psychological analyst

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,290
is a very common profession abroad.

111
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,390
How long have you been away?

112
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,270
Five years.

113
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,170
Where did you go?

114
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,040
Europe.

115
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,410
That place is quite far, isn't it?

116
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,410
If you've been there,

117
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,460
you wouldn't think it's far.

118
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,660
What do you think of my idea?

119
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,200
You can recommend me to the police station...

120
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,830
In some places,
it's actually the opposite.

121
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,670
It looks very close,

122
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,870
but it's actually very far.

123
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,260
Here's a piece of advice for you.

124
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,370
Jiangzhou is not Europe.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,900
Thank you for your help.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,260
Mind your own business in the future.

127
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,240
Hanging ornaments.

128
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,730
Sachet ornaments, come and take a look.

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,300
(Qin Residence)

130
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,860
I'm back.

131
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,380
Dad.

132
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,580
Uncle Fu.

133
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,500
I'm back.

134
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,660
Young Master.

135
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,700
Young Master.

136
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,380
You're finally back.

137
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,860
We have a big problem.

138
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,380
The clock murder case that shocked Jiangzhou

139
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,000
involves four lives.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,540
(Jiangzhou Times)
The evidence is conclusive.

141
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,850
(Human body clock found in Qin's garden.)
Your dad has already confessed.

142
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,820
That can't be possible.

143
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,780
My dad is a lawyer.

144
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,140
How could he break the law?

145
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,820
(Uncle Fu: Qin's butler)
That's what I told

146
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,180
the detective squad.

147
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,100
I need to ask my dad about it.

148
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,380
Young Master!

149
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,780
(Case Name: Clock murder case.
Case Status: Closed.)

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,380
Qin Weilian?

151
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,020
Yes, he is my father.

152
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
Go back.

153
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,220
He is a felon

154
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,860
and will be executed soon.

155
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,100
Now,

156
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,140
no visits are allowed.

157
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,500
I am a family member.

158
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
I have the right to visit him.

159
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,860
This is humane.

160
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,780
But the prison has the right

161
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,980
to refuse you.

162
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,460
This is the rule.

163
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,700
How long has it been?

164
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,660
What?

165
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,740
I mean

166
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,860
you and that female clerk.

167
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,020
How long

168
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,740
have you been together?

169
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

170
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,420
When she walked past you,

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,740
you subconsciously leaned forward,

172
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,740
and touched the ring on your hand.

173
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,020
Also,

174
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
when I mentioned

175
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,220
your improper relationship,

176
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,380
you touched your forehead.

177
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,580
These

178
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,060
all reflect your anxiety and guilt.

179
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,780
I think

180
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,100
you must be having sleepless nights now,

181
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,900
feeling you've done something wrong,

182
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,260
and feeling sorry for your wife,

183
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,860
but not knowing what to do.

184
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,100
Isn't that right?

185
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,380
I understand your inner torment,

186
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,620
just like how I feel
when I can't see my father.

187
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,620
If you could let me see my father,

188
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,100
then

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,660
I will pretend I didn't see anything.

190
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,620
(Jiangzhou Prison)

191
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,460
Thank you.

192
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,140
Dad,

193
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,100
are you okay?

194
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,620
(Qin William: Lawyer)
Huole,

195
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,620
why are you back?

196
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,380
No matter what happens,

197
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,820
don't worry.

198
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,580
I will get you out.

199
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,060
No.

200
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,780
Aren't you supposed

201
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,700
to be studying in Europe?

202
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,020
I read the letter you sent me.

203
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,500
The tone was completely different.

204
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,660
Also,

205
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,700
you suddenly gave me
all the tuition fees,

206
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,820
and asked me to settle in Europe.

207
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,380
Even a fool could see
something was wrong.

208
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,500
I made all sorts of assumptions
on the way here,

209
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,180
but I never thought

210
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,700
you would be wrongfully accused of
being a murderer.

211
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,820
I'm not wrongfully accused.

212
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,820
I plead guilty.

213
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
You're lying.

214
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,340
Just now, you blinked very quickly,

215
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
and your shoulder moved a bit.

216
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,980
This shows that you don't even trust

217
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,820
your own words.

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,060
Your body and mind are not in sync.

219
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,900
Dad,

220
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,540
don't forget you're a lawyer.

221
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,140
Are you really going to use your life

222
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,860
to cover up someone else' crime?

223
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

224
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,620
Dad,

225
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,540
I know you are very anxious right now.

226
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,820
Anxiety?

227
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,180
What am I anxious about?

228
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,280
You place your hands on your chest.

229
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,980
Only someone
who is extremely anxious inside,

230
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,460
but doesn't want others to know,

231
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,300
would unconsciously set up a barrier.

232
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,420
I sent you abroad to study for so long,

233
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,540
and this is all you've learned?

234
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,020
The four victims

235
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
The first one is a person surnamed Tuo,

236
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,700
who was a thief in his youth,

237
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,820
nicknamed Little Ghost Chaser.

238
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
The second one, Jin Pang,

239
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,900
was the Tuo family's butler.

240
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,460
Because his surname is Jin
and he looks fat,

241
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,820
people call him Fat Jin.

242
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,980
The third one is named Xiao Qiance,

243
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,940
who served as an adjudicator.

244
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,860
The fourth one,

245
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
is Zhu Gengsheng,

246
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,700
the renowned former mayor
of Jiangzhou.

247
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,740
Dad,

248
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,660
you've interacted with all four victims,

249
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,940
but you have no motive.

250
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,780
The law,

251
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,900
only cares about evidence.

252
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,140
Is it just because of the book

253
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,860
that records Western witchcraft?

254
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,940
The book has a picture
of a human body clock,

255
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,780
showing the time as twelve o'clock,

256
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,380
twenty minutes,

257
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,660
and forty seconds.

258
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,500
And the bodies of the deceased,

259
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,020
were arranged exactly at this time.

260
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,740
Also, the detective squad

261
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,500
dug up a soul sealing jar
in the backyard,

262
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,700
containing the names of the four victims.

263
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,380
At Wuyi Lane,

264
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,180
at the crime scene, someone

265
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,860
saw me passing by in a lawyer's robe.

266
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,340
So, both witness and physical evidence
are present.

267
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,740
I confess.

268
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,700
Confess?

269
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,660
Killing is not a trial.

270
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,420
You wore that lawyer's robe,

271
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,860
afraid that others
wouldn't recognize you.

272
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,780
And that soul sealing jar.

273
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,340
Even if you wanted
to seal someone's soul.

274
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,900
it should be buried in a remote forest,

275
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,380
not in our backyard.

276
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,940
The soil was freshly turned.

277
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,780
You just wanted the police

278
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,700
to gather evidence.

279
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,820
This is my fate.

280
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,820
We shouldn't accept fate.

281
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,620
That's what you taught me
since I was young.

282
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,820
Time's up.

283
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,300
Dad.

284
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,700
Why did you do this?

285
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
Don't ask.

286
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,060
Listen to me.

287
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,740
You should go back immediately

288
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,580
to Europe.

289
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,780
to finish your studies.

290
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,220
Dad.

291
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,180
I will definitely save you.
