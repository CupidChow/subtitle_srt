00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,020
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

3
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,720
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,110
I need to see your director.

5
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,950
Please show me the way.

(Re-investigation Application Form
of Jiangzhou Police Station)

00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,670
(Person in Investigation: Qin Weilian)
Qin Weilian

8
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,530
is your father?

9
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,510
Yes.

10
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,970
There are many doubts
about my father's case.

11
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,360
It needs to be re-investigated.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,970
I personally solved your father's case.

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,000
There are no doubts.

14
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,310
My dad is a lawyer.

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,160
He wouldn't kill anyone.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,830
Cases are solved based on evidence.

17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,860
Not personal feelings.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,000
No.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,050
You must have made a mistake.

20
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,200
I need to see your director.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,550
I request a re-investigation of this case.

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,050
- to clear my dad's name.
- Re-investigate?

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,660
Do you think handling a case
is a child's game?

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,220
Is your father's life more valuable?

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,880
Is the victim's life worthless?

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
That's why the real culprit
shouldn't get away.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,520
With your little tricks?

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,470
That's science.

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,610
What nonsense science.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,500
You are not fit to be a detective.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
Let go of me!

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,170
- Look carefully.
- Let go of me!

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,220
This is the police station.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,220
It represents the law of Jiangzhou.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,410
It's because I believe in the law.

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,600
I don't want my father

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,080
to be wronged.

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,890
And let the real culprit go free.

39
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,220
Captain Song, by stopping me like this,

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,450
are you upholding the law,

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,740
or your own pride?

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,360
Are you afraid I'll find the truth,

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,470
and prove you wrong?

44
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,470
- Right?
- You...

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,310
Captain Song.

46
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,330
Captain Song.

47
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,530
Captain Song!

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,040
- Captain Song!
- What's wrong, Xu?

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,060
Save my daughter!

50
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,690
Uncle Song.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,970
My hand.

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,900
It hurts so much.

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,870
Don't be afraid.
I will help you open it right away.

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,220
Wait, wait!

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,900
The culprit also gave this,

56
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,810
and said it would explode
as soon as you take it out.

57
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Outrageous!

58
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,100
(Chen Zheng, Mao Shuai: Police)

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,130
Uncle Song.

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,390
I still need to learn to play the piano.

61
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,970
I can't be without my hands.

62
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,990
Duoduo, don't cry.

63
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,180
I won't let you get hurt.

64
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,550
Let me take a look.

65
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,870
Mao, go to the office and get the tools.

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,100
- Yes!
- Chen Zheng.

67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,290
Notify everyone immediately.

68
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,400
Evacuate from the police station

69
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,500
to a safe place as soon as possible.

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,590
And quickly call Doctor Fan.

71
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,430
Yes!

72
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,340
Attention everyone.

73
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,690
Quickly evacuate

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,810
to a safe area.

75
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,390
Don't move.

76
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,850
Do you want to die?
Hurry up and leave.

77
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,010
I can help.

78
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,110
No need.

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,570
Captain Song, I can really help.

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
Take him away.

81
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,960
Captain Song,
it is a reverse pressure ignition device

82
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,340
of mortise and tenon structure.

83
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
If you open the box carelessly,

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,870
it will be like moving a mousetrap.

85
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,850
It will explode immediately.

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,900
What should we do?

87
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
Duoduo

88
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,510
Duoduo, don't be afraid. Listen to me.

89
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,040
Your hand will be fine.

90
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,550
I am a doctor. I never lie.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,290
Captain Song, I just heard.

92
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,040
Since he knows the origin of this thing,

93
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,060
let him try.

94
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,850
It hurts.

95
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,220
There's no time. Let him try.

96
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,510
Let him go.

97
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,960
Although I know the principle
of the pressure ignition device,

98
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,660
the problem is this wooden board.

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,550
If we accidentally remove the board,

100
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,220
the result will be the same
as prying open the box.

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,410
Can you do it or not?

102
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,220
Get to work.

103
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,810
Hurry up.

104
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,900
Don't waste my efforts.

105
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,970
A wine opener, a gift for my dad.

106
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,490
You want to use it to disarm the bomb?

107
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes.

108
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,150
Based on my observation
of the wooden box,

109
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,320
the thickness of this wooden board

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,340
does not exceed 0.2 inches.

111
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,470
As long as you use an awl
at a safe position

112
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,310
to drill a small hole,

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,490
and then pick out the core wire,

114
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,490
you can disrupt the circuit.

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,990
Where is the safe position?

116
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,990
Here.

117
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,100
Pry it open.

118
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
Pry it.

119
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,490
It will open.

120
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,730
Six lives,

121
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,140
it's also a good result.

122
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,640
Make the hole a bit bigger.

123
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480
I need to see clearly.

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Give me the glasses.

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
Okay.

126
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
Here.

127
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,930
Trust me.

128
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,220
You can open the clip now.

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
It's safe now.

130
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,110
Duoduo is safe.

131
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,370
You're safe now.

132
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:33,020

(Explosive Maniac: Coldness is a light

(Fan Xiaofan:

137
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,750
Nice to meet you.

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,050
Hello, my name is Qin Huole.

139
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,370
You can call me Mr. Qin.

140
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,930
You were quite professional just now.

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,140
I saw a bunch of foreign goods
in your bag.

142
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,340
Did you study abroad?

143
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Yes.

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
Captain Song.

145
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,260
- My father's case...
- Enough, stop talking.

146
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,170
Thank you for your help just now,

147
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,820
but regarding your father's case,

148
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,230
there's nothing I can do.

149
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,030
So the culprit of the Clock Murder Case,

150
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,020
Qin Weilian,

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,660
is your father?

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,840
He didn't kill anyone,

153
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,410
because his motive for the crime

154
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,660
doesn't hold up at all.

155
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
In my opinion,

156
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,470
there are

157
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,730
only two possibilities.

158
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,340
One is an ordinary murder,

159
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,930
and I lean more towards the other one.

160
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,990
Let's hear it.

161
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
For example,

162
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,610
a culprit with a blood debt,

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,340
who uses the same method

164
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,850
to kill dozens of people,

165
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
and becomes

166
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,170
more skillful.

167
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,410
But in my view,

168
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,930
this is still an ordinary murder.

169
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,190
There is another possibility.

170
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,660
It is a culprit

171
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,290
who has to complete certain actions

172
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,580
to satisfy its own desires.

173
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,460
If you confuse the two,

174
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,700
you will misjudge the case details.

175
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,700
I think I understand now.

176
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,190
Come with me.

177
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,590
Didn't you say you didn't believe it?

178
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,960
Today, I'll let you see it yourself.

179
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,170
Come over here.

180
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,900
Look.

181
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,540
(Walking for the Innocent)
Three years ago,

182
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,880
when Captain Song came to Jiangzhou,

183
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,030
in his first case,

184
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,900
people gave it to him.

185
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,660
From that time on,

186
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,880
until today,

187
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,720
it's been three years,

188
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,830
over a thousand days,

189
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,200
and thirty-three cases.

190
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,040
Whatever cases,

191
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,760
Captain Song has kept these four words

192
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
in his heart.

193
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,930
He constantly asks himself,

194
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,960
whether he truly deserves

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,970
these four words.

196
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
So,

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,170
your father's case,

198
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,910
and those thirty-three cases,

199
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,750
are no different.

200
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,410
There is no miscarriage of justice.

201
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,610
Stop being unreasonable.

202
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,880
Do you understand?

203
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,470
What Walking for the Innocent?

204
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,890
I think it's just an empty name.

205
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,230
Now there's a miscarriage of justice.

206
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,100
He pretends not to see.

207
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,350
I think,

208
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,320
he's just afraid of me

209
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,540
ruining this reputation.

210
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,820
Are you done talking?

211
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,460
If so, you can leave.

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,130
You're just scared.

213
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
Afraid of me

214
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,300
proving you wrong in the end.

215
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,760
Impossible.

216
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,660
What if?

217
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,940
You won't let this go, will you?

218
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,010
Alright, alright!

219
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,130
Arguing like this
won't get you anywhere,

220
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,420
I have a suggestion.

221
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,820
Why don't we re-investigate this case,

222
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,610
and let him lose convincingly?

223
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,540
You said,

224
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,770
to uphold the name
of Walking for the Innocent,

225
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,220
you would die a thousand deaths.

226
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,160
Captain Song,

227
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,340
you are my father's last hope.

228
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,710
Alright,

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,280
today, for Xiaofan's sake,

230
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
I'll make an exception.

231
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,300
But listen to me carefully.

232
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,580
My thoughts haven't changed at all.

233
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,540
This case has ample evidence.

234
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,540
If there is any mistake in the result,

235
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,610
I will take down this plaque.

236
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,010
I will personally break it.

237
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,430
Alright.

238
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,300
You said it yourself.

239
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,730
- Xiaofan.
- Are you close?

240
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,950
Call her Doctor Fan.

241
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,550
Doctor Fan,

242
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,890
you need to testify for us.

243
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,400
No problem.

244
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,580
So, where should we start investigating?

245
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
Let's go.

246
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,660
(General Office)

247
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,730
Duoduo is really strong.

248
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,870
I have a few questions

249
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,710
to ask you.

250
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,300
You need to answer me seriously.

251
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,110
So that I can quickly

252
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,240
catch that bad guy.

253
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
Okay?

254
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,730
Think carefully.

255
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,040
At that time,

256
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,250
what exactly happened?

257
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,920
It's best to tell me

258
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,820
everything you can think of.

259
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,940
At that time,

260
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,180
hand it over to Song He
from the detective squad.

261
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,220
Do you remember?

262
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,890
Yes, I do.

263
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,010
Who are you?

264
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,300
I am...

265
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,010
Guess.

266
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,650
There is a bomb inside here.

267
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,010
Do not open this clip.

268
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,460
Are you okay?

269
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm fine.

270
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,940
Couldn't be better.

271
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,610
This is what you wanted to see.

272
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
The four bodies related

273
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,820
to the human clock case.

274
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,100
Look at these bodies.

275
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,070
Aren't you afraid?

276
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,820
What is there to be afraid of?

277
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,000
My duty

278
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,920
is to read the last messages

279
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,010
they left in this world.

280
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Do you know?

281
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,770
Bodies

282
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,180
can actually communicate.

283
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,830
Every night,

284
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,770
they talk to me.

285
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,850
Do you know what they say to me?

286
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
They say...

287
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,820
Look how scared you are.

288
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,130
By the way, after looking at the bodies,

289
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,610
did you find anything new?

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,010
Not yet.

291
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,700
Then I can only help you up to here.

292
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,280
For other information about the case,

293
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,460
you still need to find Captain Song.

294
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,470
But he should

295
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,010
be having a headache
over the explosion.

296
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,850
The explosion even reached the gate.

297
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,940
Fortunately, there were no casualties.

298
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,060
Director Xu will definitely be furious.

299
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Mr. Qin.

300
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,650
Regarding this case,

301
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,220
what are your thoughts?

302
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,300
I don't have much information now.

303
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,180
I need more clues.

304
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,760
It seems

305
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,710
you want me to help your Captain Song

306
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,750
investigate the explosion case.

307
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,060
If you help him solve the case,

308
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,110
he will have the mind

309
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,300
to re-investigate your father's case.

310
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,610
You are also helping yourself.

311
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,650
I have a strong feeling.

312
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,320
If the two of you

313
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,460
can work together,

314
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,540
it will definitely be so efficient.

315
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,340
Forget it.

316
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,830
With his bad temper,

317
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,130
I really can't stand it.

318
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,300
Once my father's case is closed,

319
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,650
I will never deal with him again.

320
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,580
Don't speak too definitively.

321
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,220
Who knows

322
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,430
about the future.
