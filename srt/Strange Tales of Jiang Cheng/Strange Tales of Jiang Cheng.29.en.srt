=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 29=

2
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,580
Gu Sui is a hard nut to crack.

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,820
He refuses to speak.

4
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,490
What should we do now?

5
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,040
We don't even know

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,990
if Xu Shenxing is still alive.

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,330
If this continues,

8
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,130
it might be hard for him to survive.

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,890
We need to work out something quickly.

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,380
Gu Sui is very confident.

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,490
He believes that we can't find the place

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,440
where he hid the person.

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,800
But I think

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,300
this may not

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,540
be a bad thing for us.

16
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,180
If we don't take the initiative,

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,540
we won't be able to get him to talk.

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,720
I have an idea.

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,180
If I tell you now,

20
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,220
you might not understand it.

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,450
But we can give it a try.

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,670
After all,

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,250
we don't have any time left.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,620
Alright, get to the point.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,590
No matter how strange your idea is now,

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,430
I won't be surprised.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,740
(Mend Your Ways)

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,010
Officers,

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,620
don't waste your effort.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,250
Don't be too happy now.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,630
The doctor just finished treating you.

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,010
Say less nonsense,

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,660
or your wound will break down again.

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,540
I understand every word

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,540
of what you just said,

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,340
but when they are put together,

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,970
I don't understand the meaning at all.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,340
You don't need to understand.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,820
I want you to trust me

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,220
and then

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
follow my plan.

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,900
I trust you,

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080
but

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,620
if we fail,

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,520
what will the consequence be?

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,130
The consequence is

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,280
we might never find

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,250
Xu Shenxing and Huanyang.

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,080
I support you.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,970
Since it's a last resort,

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,550
we can only gamble on our luck.

52
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,290
Haven't we won many times before?

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,920
I believe

54
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,950
fate will still

55
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,410
be on our side this time.

56
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,550
Alright.

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,540
At worst, for the rest of my life,

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,660
I won't be a police officer anymore.

59
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,200
Don't worry.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,130
If we really fail,

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,830
I've even thought of a backup plan
for you.

62
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,990
Just go to the Governor's Mansion.

63
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,500
Aren't you good friends with Zou Jing?

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Forget it.

65
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,690
I don't want Zou Jing to be my leader.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,060
Trust me, you won't lose your job.

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,430
You guys go out first.

68
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,060
I want to talk to him alone.

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Gu Sui,

71
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,780
I know you're still awake.

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,540
I want to talk to you

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,660
about Huanyang.

74
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,970
Save it.

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,660
From now on, I won't say anything anymore.

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
So don't bother.

77
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,850
What is this place?

78
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,660
Aren't you afraid of nothing?

79
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,610
You're a police officer.

80
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,760
You can't use lynching.

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,140
I am using lynching.

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Tell me,

83
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,990
where are they?

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,160
Tell me,

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,490
where are they?

86
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,170
I don't believe you dare to shoot.

87
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,550
Song He,

88
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
you are too...

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,810
Now you know
whether I dare to shoot or not.

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,930
I'll ask you one last time.

91
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,550
Where

92
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,370
are they?

93
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,750
Not talking, huh?

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,780
Keeping you around is useless.

95
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,910
Captain, we found

96
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,780
Xu Shenxing and Huanyang.

97
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,580
Song He,

98
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,020
your acting is too poor.

99
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,340
If you've found them,

100
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,170
bring them here for me.

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,810
Bring them in.

102
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,140
Impossible.

103
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,550
Impossible.

104
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,410
How did you know I hid them
in Huanyinglou?

105
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
How did you know

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,170
I hid them in Huanyinglou?

107
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Impossible.

108
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,900
That's impossible.

109
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,870
You...

110
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,670
- Just now...
- Thank you for being honest

111
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,510
with the whereabouts

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,140
of Xu Shenxing and Huanyang.

113
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,220
(Huanyinglou)

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,370
Huanyang,

115
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,020
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,140
I dragged you into this.

117
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,780
In my next life...

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,810
- Don't.
- Next life...

119
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,460
Don't.

120
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,310
Quick, save him.

121
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,700
- Quick.
- Save him.

122
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,850
I asked Miss Huanyang.

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,970
That secret room was constructed
a long time ago.

124
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,580
She discovered it by accident

125
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,700
and only told Gu Sui.

126
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,240
Unexpectedly,

127
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,170
Gu Sui hid them right under our noses.

128
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,070
For Gu Sui,

129
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,910
that place

130
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,410
was his and Huanyang's secret territory.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,140
It was the perfect place

132
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,170
to punish the intruder.

133
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,620
It was a long night.

134
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,780
I need to go home and catch up on sleep.

135
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,170
This case is closed.

136
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Can you tell me now

137
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,910
why you always won

138
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,330
at Youlong Gambling House?

139
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,390
It's very simple.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,860
Just two sentences.

141
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,150
Which two sentences?

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,860
There is no such thing as always winning
in gambling in this world.

143
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,780
What's the second sentence?

144
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,690
Believe in what you see.

145
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,190
Place your bets.

146
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,780
Anyone else wants to place a bet?

147
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,440
Place your bets.

148
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
- Open.
- Big, big.

149
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,350
- Small.
- Open.

150
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,740
- Place your bets.
- Big.

151
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
Good.

152
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,780
Two blinks for big

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,860
and one blink for small.

154
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,720
After I observed this,

155
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,360
I just followed

156
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,260
the cheater's bets.

157
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,540
Is it that simple?

158
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,260
Freud once said,

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,330
he that has eyes to see
and ears to hear

160
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,540
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret.

161
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,170
If his lips are silent,

162
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,000
he chatters with his fingertips.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,040
Betrayal oozes out of him

164
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
at every pore.

165
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,030
Of course,

166
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,210
the dealer who shook the dice

167
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
is no exception.

168
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,980
Th-Thank you.

169
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,030
Your pronunciation is not right.

170
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,210
I'll teach you properly tomorrow.

171
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,860
Do I need to pay tuition?

172
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,640
Stop joking.

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,050
We still need to ask about Xu Shenxing.

174
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,780
See you tomorrow.

175
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,440
(Xu Residence)

176
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
Why did you come
without bringing a gift?

177
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,780
We're here to visit the injured.

178
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,540
Don't you also come empty-handed?

179
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,450
What are you two talking about?

180
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,030
We are saying

181
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,720
that you are the smartest,

182
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,070
most resourceful, and most capable one.

183
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,090
Captain Song, please.

184
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,600
Master.

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
Welcome.

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
Director Xu.

187
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,050
No need for formalities at home.

188
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,150
Yes.

189
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,690
This time, Shenxing

190
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,140
was able to be rescued

191
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,600
all thanks to you.

192
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
Right now,

193
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,860
I am not a director
of the police station.

194
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,170
I am just a father.

195
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,900
So, for this gratitude,

196
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,290
please accept my bow.

197
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,640
- Director Xu.
- Director Xu.

198
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
Please don't do this.

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,480
Director Xu,

200
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,900
if it is possible,

201
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,090
we would like to speak
with your son alone.

202
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,680
Sure,

203
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,790
you can talk.

204
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,980
I'll go prepare some refreshments
for you.

205
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,030
Thank you, Director.

206
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,050
If there's anything you want to know,

207
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
feel free to ask.

208
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,480
Mr. Xu,

209
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,980
I want to know

210
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,210
what exactly happened that night.

211
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,560
That night,

212
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,380
I had a quarrel with Zhuang Si

213
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,260
and drank a lot of alcohol.

214
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,870
Mr. Xu,

215
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,500
- listen to me.
- Let's drink.

216
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,210
Mr. Xu, listen to me.

217
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,290
Someone wants to kill you.

218
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,980
Now I need to switch clothes with you,

219
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,330
so that they think I were you.

220
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,450
When I woke up again,

221
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,000
Huanyang and I

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,540
were tied up in a secret room.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
I heard

224
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,620
Miss Huanyang is now living
at your house.

225
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,450
I was tortured for so long.

226
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Without Huanyang's

227
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,330
encouragement from time to time,

228
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,410
I would have probably died long ago.

229
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,980
So I decided

230
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,620
not to let her down anymore.

231
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,860
The reason you didn't pick her up back then

232
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,690
is not Little Anu,

233
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,050
but

234
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,780
Director Xu's objection, right?

235
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,150
Yes.

236
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,780
But after this incident,

237
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,690
my father finally agreed.

238
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,900
Not only will I marry Huanyang,

239
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,240
but I will never

240
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,740
go to those places of debauchery again.

241
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,340
(Xu Residence)

242
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,540
Why do I still feel something
is not quite right?

243
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,900
I feel the same way.

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,660
Let's head back to the police station first.

245
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,740
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

246
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,170
I'll sort things out.

247
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,560
Shen Yuan thought Zhuang Si

248
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,480
wanted to kill Xu Shenxing.

249
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,690
So he decided to die in his place.

250
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,790
After he and Xu Shenxing swapped clothes,

251
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,810
he hid him under the bed.

252
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,840
Unexpectedly,

253
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,050
it was Gu Sui who came.

254
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,380
Gu Sui thought the person
lying on the bed was Xu Shenxing,

255
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,410
so he killed him.

256
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,900
Gu Sui discovered Xu Shenxing.

257
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,040
But why didn't he just

258
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,690
kill Xu Shenxing as well?

259
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,160
Why go through all the trouble

260
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,050
of hiding him

261
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,470
and peeling off Shen Yuan's face

262
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,500
to mislead us?

263
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,190
What if his initial plan

264
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,240
was to abduct Xu Shenxing

265
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,380
and torture him to death?

266
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,380
Then Shen Yuan wouldn't have died.

267
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,050
But if that's not the case,

268
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,620
what exactly caused him

269
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,620
to suddenly change his mind

270
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,210
and his plan?

271
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,570
Qin Huole,

272
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,380
can you stop fiddling with that thing?

273
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,510
What's your idea?

274
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,380
My idea?

275
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,170
My idea

276
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,050
is to ask Gu Sui.

277
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,910
If he talks,

278
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,140
- why would I still...
- Captain.

279
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Detective Qin.

280
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,620
There's a call from the prison.

281
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,260
Gu Sui wants to see you.

282
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,790
Captain Song.

283
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,210
Sorry, it was our negligence.

284
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,090
We forgot to remove the bandage
from his wound.

285
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,410
He used it to commit suicide.

286
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,680
Please forgive us.

287
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,360
No one wants this to happen.

288
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,600
- Please go back.
- Alright.

289
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,440
Take care.

290
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,210
Gu Sui couldn't have committed suicide.

291
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
Right.

292
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,380
He wanted to see us.

293
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,540
Clearly, he wanted to tell us something.

294
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,920
Why did he suddenly hang himself

295
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,780
just before we arrived?

296
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,780
This case seems to be closed,

297
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,330
but I feel like there are
more and more doubts.

298
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,170
Gu Su has died.

299
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,090
No one would ever know the truth.

300
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,870
No,

301
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,960
there is one more person

302
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,380
who should know.

303
