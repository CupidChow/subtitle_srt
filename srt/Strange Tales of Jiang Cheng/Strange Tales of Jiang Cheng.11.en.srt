00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,820
(Detective novels: The true wisdom
is to know one's own ignorance.)

3
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,310
Here.

4
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
Captain.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,440
A fisherman reported to us

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,350
that he found a body early in the morning

7
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,300
and was terrified.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,120
The victim was put

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,100
in a red lacquered lantern.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,480
It's just like the story,

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,440
The Death Lantern.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,460
It's extremely eerie.

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,590
What lantern?

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,040
The Death Lantern.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,890
Haven't you read that novel
by Huo Qingxin?

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,110
He is the most famous novelist
in Jiangzhou.

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,400
He has written
several best-selling detective novels.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,470
We've all read them.

19
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,300
They are indeed quite scary.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,520
Dr. Fan.

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,450
Mr. Che?

22
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,460
(Autopsy Room
of Jiangzhou Police Station)

23
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,710
There are no external injuries
on the body.

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,380
Mouth open, eyes closed, flesh pale.

25
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,240
A small amount

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,680
of red foam is oozing
from the nasal cavity.

27
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,250
The abdomen is slightly swollen.

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,970
There is a sound when tapped.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,760
Both fists are clenched tightly.

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,130
There is mud under the fingernails.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,450
The skin on both feet
is wrinkled and white.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
No swelling.

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,710
Drowned to death?

34
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,410
The time of death

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,570
should be around 11 o'clock last night.

36
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,220
Has he always been teaching
at Sicun Middle School?

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,850
For nearly 20 years.

38
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,620
He's the best

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,970
iChinese teacher in Jiangzhou.

40
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,290
Mr. Che

41
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,620
was always gentle and refined.

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,690
He was a good teacher,

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,730
and a good person.

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,100
I really can't understand

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,730
who would

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
have such a deep hatred

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,690
for Mr. Che,

48
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,970
and killed him in such a cruel way.

49
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,630
Do you know anything else

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,730
about Mr. Che?

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,170
Maybe

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,850
you can provide us with some clues.

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,060
Actually, three days ago,

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,970
I met Mr. Che.

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,550
That day

56
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,290
was Mr. Che's birthday.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,920
He knew

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,780
I would definitely go.

59
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,160
So he had prepared

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,260
my favorite rice cakes

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,490
and his treasured good tea.

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,560
Mr. Che

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,490
played the guqin very well.

64
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,020
My favorite piece of his music

65
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,580
is Forgetting the Vulgar Ideas.

66
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,460
Mr. Che's usual music

67
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,660
was too melancholic.

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,780
But at that time,

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,580
his music was more soothing

70
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,870
than usual.

71
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,960
(Che Jingwen,
teacher of Sicun Middle School)

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,020
He seemed

73
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,730
to be in a good mood.

74
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,630
He was very talkative.

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,460
Before I left,

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,490
he gave me his guqin,

77
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,610
a treasure he kept for 20 years.

78
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,140
A guqin he treasured for 20 years?

79
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,350
Did he say anything else

80
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,710
when he gave it to you?

81
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,680
He knew that you and I

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,020
solved the bomb case

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,460
and the clock murder case.

84
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,930
He was very proud of me,

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
so

86
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,170
he gave me the guqin

87
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,630
as a gift.

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
Captain.

89
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,550
Captain.

90
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,470
- I can't find the book.
- What?

91
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,780
Wait, let me explain.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
The people of Jiangzhou

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,470
are all curious.

94
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,960
As soon as they heard
that Che Jingwen's death

95
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,450
was exactly like
what was written in the book,

96
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,880
they immediately bought out
all the copies.

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,470
Even the small book rental stalls

98
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,410
were not spared.

99
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,220
What's the name

100
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,350
of the author of that book again?

101
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,490
- Huo Qingxin.
- Go.

102
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,310
Find out where he lives.
Let's go find him.

103
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Yes.

104
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,040
Mr. Che,

105
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,540
rest assured.

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,460
No matter who the murderer is

107
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,290
or what the cost is,

108
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,730
we will bring him to justice

109
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,580
and give you peace.

110
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,310
Uncle Fu.

111
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,410
Uncle Fu, I'm back.

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
Young Master,

113
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,050
why are you back
from the police station?

114
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,410
(The Death Lantern)
I came back to get this book.

115
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,540
Isn't this the novel
related to the murder case?

116
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,660
You know about it, too?

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,160
Take a look.

118
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,710
(Duck Lake, The Death Lantern)
The whole of Jiangzhou knows about it.

119
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,780
This book has been sold out.

120
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,120
I was browsing a bookstall
a few days ago

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,450
and found the title very interesting,

122
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:09,990
so I bought it.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,430
- I'm leaving now.
- Young Master.

124
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,560
I found this in the mailbox

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,150
in the morning.

126
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,410
This is for you.

127
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,300
(To Qin Huole)
For me?

128
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,310
Who sent it?

129
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,910
Young Master, I don't know.

130
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,370
Maybe it's from your friend.

131
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,870
Alright.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,410
Thanks, Uncle Fu. I'm leaving now.

133
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,050
- Goodbye.
- Take care, Young Master.

134
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Dad,

135
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,610
you didn't go to
do volunteer work today?

136
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,930
If you have something to ask, just ask.

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,610
Don't make small talk.

138
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,270
Dad, when Che Jingwen
came to see you last time,

139
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,710
besides Jushangfang,

140
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,850
did he mention anything else?

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
I remember,

142
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,120
that day,

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
he didn't seem very cheerful.

144
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
Mr. Che

145
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,460
has always liked to be alone.

146
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,320
He rarely opened up to anyone.

147
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
I think

148
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,780
he was not happy.

149
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,970
Did something happen to him?

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,290
Not that I heard of.

151
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,310
Alright.

152
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,020
Thanks for the clue. I'm leaving now.

153
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,670
Wait, wait.

154
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,970
The case at Yuan Lake

155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,810
doesn't seem that simple.

156
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,070
Be careful.

157
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,630
Don't play

158
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,960
your little tricks

159
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,270
and act impulsively or carelessly.

160
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,120
Did you forget who solved your case?

161
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
I cleared your name.

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,680
What case in this world

163
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,520
could stump me?

164
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,630
Bye.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
Chen Zheng.

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Qin,

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
are you looking for Captain Song?

168
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,140
Yes, where is he?

169
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,980
He went with Mao to find Huo Qingxin.

170
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,380
They went on a major task without me?

171
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,140
(Huo Residence)
Hey, Zhang,

172
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,910
let me tell you.

173
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,670
Destroy all the stock

174
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,070
you have now

175
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,520
and only print the collector's edition.

176
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,140
Raise the price by two times.

177
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,740
(Huo Qingxin, novelist)
Let me tell you.

178
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,050
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

179
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
What?

180
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Stop joking.

181
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,780
Do you want to make money or not?

182
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,320
Alright then.

183
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,090
Do as I said right now.

184
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,310
Additionally,

185
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,600
put up a notice.

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
One person can only buy one copy.

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,190
(Notice)
I do not sell books personally.

188
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,950
The Death Lantern collector's edition

189
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,430
is being reprinted,

190
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,640
and will soon be available
from Jiangzhou Publishing House.

191
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,860
Stay tuned.

192
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,150
Reprinting the collector's edition?

193
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,450
What an opportunist.

194
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,020
He has a sharp business instinct.

195
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,930
You are well informed.

196
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,360
Captain Song.

197
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,810
You are really not being fair.

198
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,210
You came without me.

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Your task

200
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,170
is to assist the detective squad.

201
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,090
Do you know what that means?

202
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,000
It means we call you when we need you.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
When we don't need you,

204
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,120
stay put in the police station.

205
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
I think

206
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,860
you need help right now.

207
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,070
You don't really think
that in our police station

208
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,980
no one else can solve cases besides you,
do you?

209
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,310
Before you came back,

210
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,950
weren't we handling cases just fine?

211
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,790
Captain Song.

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,090
I finally found you.

213
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,360
I was patrolling the streets.

214
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,790
Tailor Wang at Longchang Street said

215
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,760
someone

216
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,170
broke into his shop with a knife.

217
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,950
He and his wife
fought with the burglar.

218
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,260
His wife was strangled to death.

219
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,620
The burglar escaped.

220
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,670
Mao, go check it out.

221
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,510
Yes, sir.

222
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,150
Wait.

223
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Did you just say

224
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,090
that Tailor Wang
reported the crime?

225
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,150
Yes.

226
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,030
Was he injured?

227
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,380
Slightly injured.

228
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,630
Here's a suggestion.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
Why not investigate

230
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,760
whether Tailor Wang

231
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,660
has any motive for the crime?

232
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,860
Mr. Qin,

233
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,550
I don't understand what you mean.

234
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,050
What does this have to do
with Tailor Wang?

235
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,070
If you were

236
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,330
the knife-wielding burglar,

237
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,620
facing the two of us,

238
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,330
who would you attack first?

239
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,290
It would definitely be the captain.

240
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,500
I understand now.

241
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,040
The murderer should first subdue the one

242
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,270
who poses a greater threat to him.

243
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,840
Now, it's his wife
who was strangled,

244
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,740
but not Tailor Wang.

245
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,690
So this doesn't fit
criminal psychology.

246
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,870
Right.

247
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,020
And more importantly,

248
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,090
strangulation is a method

249
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,640
that usually occurs

250
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,330
among people who are relatively close.

251
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,950
What are you standing there for?

252
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,840
Listening to a story?

253
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
Go quickly.

254
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,560
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,760
Do you know
why I went through so much trouble

256
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,170
to join the police station?

257
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,520
It was to investigate cases with you

258
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,620
to rid Jiangzhou of harm.

259
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,630
Captain Song,

260
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
you must not let down

261
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,930
my good intentions.

262
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,940
(Huo Residence)

263
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,790
Who is it?

264
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,240
Stop knocking.

265
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,310
Didn't I say already

266
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,150
no more books for sale?

267
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,860
Didn't you see the notice?

268
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,550
Detective squad of the police station.

269
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,390
Where is Huo Qingxin?

270
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,160
First, finish the task

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,030
I assigned you,

272
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,380
then we can talk about new books.

273
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,050
Don't worry.

274
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,170
For this series,

275
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,330
I plan to write
seven or eight more books.

276
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,150
Sir,

277
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,360
you have visitors.

278
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Make them leave.

279
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,500
They're detectives.

280
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,410
Zhang, that's all for today.

281
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,600
I have guests here.

282
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,510
Sorry.

283
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,860
Sorry to keep you waiting.

284
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,550
Gentlemen, I apologize.

285
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,930
Sir, this is...

286
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,000
Captain Song He
from the detective squad.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In Jiangzhou,

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
everyone knows

289
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,410
the famous detective.

290
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,030
Today, your visit

291
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,660
truly brings light to my humble house.

292
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,030
Mr. Huo,

293
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,910
this is...

294
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,950
This must be Mr. Qin,

295
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,070
who has just returned

296
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,930
from his study in Great Britain.

297
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,450
Nice to meet you.

298
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
I am not talented,

299
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,680
but I have met your esteemed father

300
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,140
a few times.

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,240
You just returned to Jiangzhou,

302
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,550
but you already solved a major case.

303
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,930
Like father, like son.

304
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,480
Hai,

305
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,680
go make a cup of coffee for Mr. Qin.

306
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,520
Yes, sir.

307
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Which kind should I take?

308
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
Silly you.

309
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
For Mr. Qin here,

310
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,670
it has to be the one I kept

311
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,570
in my study cabinet.

312
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,910
Yes, sir.

313
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,190
By the way, Captain Song,

314
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,980
would you like something to drink?

315
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm not thirsty.

316
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,030
Please,

317
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,910
have a seat.

318
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,510
Mr. Huo,

319
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,780
you must have heard

320
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,900
about what happened to Che Jingwen.

321
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,160
I still don't want to believe

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,020
that it's true.

323
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,860
Jingwen was a good person.

324
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,860
How could anyone
hold a grudge against him?

325
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,410
And even use the method from my book

326
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,050
to cruelly murder him.

327
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,980
Were you very close to him?

328
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,960
Yes.

329
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,020
Before I started writing novels,

330
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,050
I also worked as a teacher
at Sicun Middle School.

331
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,660
We were colleagues for many years.

332
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,330
After you resigned from teaching,

333
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,550
did you still keep in touch with him?

334
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,390
Yes,

335
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,900
but not very frequently.

336
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,450
This year, even less so.

337
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,380
Jingwen was the kind of person

338
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,170
who didn't seem to
like socializing much.

339
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,020
Of course, it's also my fault,

340
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,500
as I was always busy with writing.

341
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,780
When was the last time
you contacted him?

342
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,740
The last time.

343
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,600
Let me think.

344
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,260
The last...

345
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,030
Captain Song,

346
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,170
you don't suspect me, do you?

347
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
That's right.

348
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,640
The part in The Death Lantern

349
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,000
about the body sinking in the lake,

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,840
was indeed

351
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,270
Jingwen's idea.

352
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,760
- Back then, he...
- It was

353
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,290
Che Jingwen's idea?

354
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,620
He gave me the idea.

355
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,990
Of course,

356
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,540
I also polished it.

357
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,050
Many people in the literary circle
know about this.

358
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,480
Gentlemen,

359
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,070
please don't look at me like that.

360
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,000
I really have no motive

361
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
to kill Jingwen.

362
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,760
Also, these past few days,

363
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,020
I've been writing at home during the day,

364
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,880
and spending the nights at Huanyinglou.

365
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,360
Hai and those singers

366
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,620
can all testify for me.

367
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,840
Zhang from the publishing house

368
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,270
often calls me.

369
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,310
He can also testify for me.

370
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,150
Please don't get us wrong.

371
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,570
It's just routine questioning.

372
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,490
Mr. Qin.

373
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,400
Thank you.

374
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,240
Please.

375
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,510
Mr. Huo.

376
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,000
I wonder

377
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,650
if you can lend us a copy
of The Death Lantern?

378
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,760
It's urgent for the investigation.

379
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,910
We really can't wait
