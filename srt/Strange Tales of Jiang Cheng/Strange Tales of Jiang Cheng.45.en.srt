=Episode 45=

2
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,620
Hello, this is Song He.

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,140
Song He, Chen Zou is...

4
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,910
What?

5
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,140
As you told me,

6
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,420
(Captain Chen Zou of Jiangzhou Prison)
I can stop being cautious now.

7
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,500
(Deputy Commander Chen Zou
of Night God Society)

8
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,990
Chen Zou.

9
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,900
(Chen Zou, Duan Ming's subordinate)

10
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,670
Chen Zou,

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,560
born in Ningcheng,

12
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,250
and joined Jiangzhou Prison
eight years ago.

13
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,830
He is now the captain of the guards
in prison.

14
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,070
I haven't had much interaction

15
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,130
with this person.

16
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,370
I remember he didn't talk much.

17
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,250
We don't know much about him.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,780
Whether he's good or bad,

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,860
you'll have to figure it out.

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,020
(Jiangzhou Prison)

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
Captain Chen.

22
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
Captain Chen.

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,720
Captain Song, what's wrong?

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,950
Has something happened in the prison?

25
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,790
Nothing.

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,210
Chen Biao's team is drawing near.

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
Orders from above

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
that to prevent the prisoners

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,580
from causing trouble in chaos,

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,990
we need to strengthen
our security levels.

31
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,630
Whose order is it?

32
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,720
Warden Duan, obviously.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,560
Captain Chen,

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,920
please send my message to Warden Duan

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,760
that I need to see him.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,370
I've been calling his office,
but no one answered.

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,180
Sorry, Captain Song.

38
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,790
Warden Duan said

39
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,630
he won't see anyone.

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,530
I'm busy now. Sorry that I need
to leave.

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,210
Captain Chen.

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,320
Anyone who forces their way in
will be treated as a prison break.

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,180
Shoot him immediately.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,300
(Governor's Mansion)

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,990
- Zou Jing.
- What's wrong?

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,160
Hurry up, I'm busy.

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
You need to help me. I need to see

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,440
Warden Duan Ming immediately.

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,110
It seems Chen Zou has taken control
of the prison.

51
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,160
Alright, hurry up.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,000
Someone is in danger!

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Qin Huole, right?

54
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,270
Well, you two are really funny.

55
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,660
Usually, neither of you yields to
the other.

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,480
But at critical moments,

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
you both keep each other in your hearts.

58
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
It's true. Just hurry up and go.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
Stop.

60
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,060
I'm telling you, war is imminent.

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,760
To prevent potential rebel,

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,050
the Commander has issued a strict order

63
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,050
that Jiangzhou Prison must be
on the highest security alert.

64
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,990
I really can't help with this.

65
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,250
Others can't help me, but you can.

66
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,780
Fine, Zou Jing.

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,210
You're my friend. I won't make it
hard for you.

68
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,500
I'll go to see the Commander myself, okay?

69
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,680
What's wrong now?

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,020
Do you still remember how we met?

71
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,230
Three years ago,

72
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,880
when I solved the case
of the murderer Ye Xiu,

73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,950
you saved my life.

74
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,480
- So what?
- I just want to tell you

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,540
that a person's luck is limited.

76
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,530
You can't always be so lucky.

77
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,500
I'll only say this once.

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,790
Given the current situation,

79
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,920
no matter what you're doing,

80
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,860
please stop immediately.

81
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,780
Or I won't be able to save you again.

82
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,390
Fine.

83
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,460
Then let me tell you this.

84
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,300
Qin Huole is my friend.

85
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,420
Even if I have to risk my life,

86
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,380
I will save him.

87
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,060
I've said all I needed to say.

88
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,860
Take care.

89
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,060
Zou Jing!

90
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,100
(Jiangzhou Hospital)

91
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,900
(Ward Two)

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,820
- Stop.
- Stop.

93
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,580
I am Song He, captain
of the detective squad.

94
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,100
I need to report to Director Xu.

95
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,860
We are here on Commander Lei's orders

96
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
to guard this place.

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,180
Director Xu is seriously injured

98
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,380
and cannot see visitors.

99
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,980
No one is allowed inside.

100
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,020
Put down your guns.

101
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,340
Man,

102
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,420
I'll just say a few words to him here.

103
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,330
Director,

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,340
what exactly is going on?

105
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,620
Commander Lei personally

106
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,460
called me,

107
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,580
telling me to rest and recover.

108
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,780
The police station is temporarily

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,860
handed over to Lieutenant Zou.

110
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,220
He asked me to take the order.

111
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,660
What exactly does Commander Lei
want to do?

112
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,300
Commander Lei has his plans.

113
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,660
War is imminent.

114
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,580
Besides the military, the only armed force
in Jiangzhou

115
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,860
is in the police station.

116
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,620
If I was disloyal,

117
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,980
he would be attacked
from both inside and outside.

118
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,140
You should go back first.

119
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,220
Just follow

120
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,580
Lieutenant Zou's arrangements.

121
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,420
Director Xu.

122
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,260
Director Xu.

123
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,740
You should go inside and rest.

124
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,260
Go back.

125
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,540
Take good care of yourself.

126
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
Be safe.

127
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,260
Song He.

128
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,620
Be extra careful

129
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,500
in working.

130
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,620
After defeating Chen Biao,

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,140
I'll wait for you to come and take me
back to the police station.

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,700
Do you know who I am?

133
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,260
I'm Cheng Tianlang,

134
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,860
the Swift Man of Jiangzhou.

135
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,620
Have you been to the police station?

136
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,020
Do you know

137
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,020
Song He, Captain Song?

138
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,900
He's my buddy.

139
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,020
When he sees me,

140
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,820
he also has to respect me.

141
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,540
Cheng Tianlang, I need to talk to you.

142
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,860
Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

143
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,740
This is the famous man,
who walks for the innocent.

144
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,140
Song He, Captain Song.
Let's applaud him.

145
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,980
What are you doing?

146
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,300
Captain Song,

147
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,340
now everyone knows

148
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,060
that I got injured
at the police station.

149
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,820
The police station should show me
some appreciation.

150
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Isn't that right, everyone?

151
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,660
Let's go.

152
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,940
No, please don't go.

153
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,300
Let's go.

154
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
You betrayers.

155
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,760
I won't tell you more stories.

156
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,700
Hey,

157
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,740
you should at least

158
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,060
give me some rewards.

159
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,100
It's okay. I...

160
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,140
You...

161
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,780
I need you.

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,540
This potato...

163
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,420
At least I've tasted the delicacies
of the world.

164
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,500
Cheng Tianlang,

165
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,620
it depends on you now.

166
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,820
Captain Song,

167
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,980
did I hear it wrong?

168
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,420
You are asking me for help?

169
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,140
That's right.

170
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,260
I am asking you to go to the prison

171
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
and rescue Qin Huole.

172
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,300
This is really interesting.

173
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,580
A police officer

174
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,940
is asking me for help.

175
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,500
Isn't there anyone left
in your detective squad?

176
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I've already explained the situation
to you clearly.

177
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,580
Now it's a special time.

178
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,020
Not just anyone can access
Jiangzhou Prison.

179
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,340
You are a regular to the prison.

180
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,460
What do you mean I'm a regular?

181
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,740
I don't like hearing that.

182
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,720
I am now a prodigal son who returns.

183
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,100
I have given up the old business
for long.

184
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,940
I am a good citizen now.

185
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,140
If you complete this mission,

186
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,340
you can not only save Qin Huole,

187
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,340
but you can even change the fate
of Jiangzhou.

188
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,620
By that time,

189
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,860
you are not only a good citizen.

190
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,740
You will become a hero of Jiangzhou.

191
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,820
Wait.

192
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,980
Hold on.

193
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,580
Stop talking about being a hero.

194
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,420
It gives me the creeps.

195
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,900
Do you know

196
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,180
what this word means

197
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,220
when someone like you says it?

198
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,260
It means that my life

199
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,980
is at risk, Captain Song.

200
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,060
- Are you scared?
- Scared?

201
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,500
I have never been scared

202
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,540
in my life.

203
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,420
So you've agreed?

204
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,020
You...

205
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,060
Fine, let's say I have agreed.

206
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,900
But the situation has changed now.

207
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,020
Now you need me.

208
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,180
It's my turn to make demands.

209
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
Let's hear it.

210
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,500
It's simple.

211
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,540
You kneel down now,

212
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,700
kowtow three times to me,

213
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,380
and say "Thank you, Mr. Tianlang."

214
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,900
I will go and save the man

215
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,980
without a second thought.

216
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,540
No, you don't have to kowtow.

217
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,660
Then I'm not going...

218
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,660
Just three?

219
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,860
Yes, three.

220
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,340
Fine.

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,300
I was thinking of applying for a bonus
for you

222
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,820
after you complete the mission.

223
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,300
Alright, I'll kowtow three times to you.

224
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,580
But the bonus will be mine.

225
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,620
I almost fell for your trick.

226
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,580
How much is your kowtow worth?

227
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,140
I'm risking my life here.

228
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,380
The bonus should be mine.

229
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Don't worry.

230
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,540
I will give you all the bonus.

231
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,380
Thanks,

232
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,060
man.

233
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,420
Tell me

234
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,500
what to do.

235
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,220
Stop.

236
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,780
Your pass?

237
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,940
(Jiangzhou Prison Pass)
Do you know the rules?

238
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,780
Open it yourself.

239
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,700
What is that smell?

240
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,540
Go!

241
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,140
Wait!

242
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,060
Isn't this

243
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Cheng Tianlang?

244
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,060
What's up?

245
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,340
No business on the train?

246
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,540
You plan to do the job in the prison?

247
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,660
Sir, I can never escape from you.

248
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,980
I've quit the old business.

249
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,700
Now I'm working to support myself.

250
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,500
Here, Sir, cigarettes.

251
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,340
Share them.

252
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,860
I'm not as well-off as before.

253
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,220
Excuse me.

254
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,180
Let me tell you straight.

255
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,340
If you really dare

256
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,660
to give me silver dollars today,

257
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,700
I'll have someone arrest you immediately.

258
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,140
It's a special time.

259
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,420
Who knows

260
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,300
what you're up to?

261
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,780
Sir, what could I be up to?

262
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,420
I'm just collecting human waste.

263
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,420
Let him go.

264
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,860
Pass.

265
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,980
Remember this.

266
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,660
Come here.

267
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,380
What?

268
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,580
Go.

269
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,860
Underneath Jiangzhou,

270
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,340
there is an underground drainage channel

271
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,460
built during the late Qing Dynasty.

272
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,980
This drainage channel

273
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,420
connects most of the public office land
in the city.

274
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,820
The designer

275
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,540
was your father's mentor,

276
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,220
Mr. Guan Boling.

277
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,100
What about him?

278
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,260
I would like you to find the gentleman,

279
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,540
and get a copy of the underground
drainage system of Jiangzhou for me.

280
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,620
If the situation in the prison

281
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,860
is more complicated than you expected,

282
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,860
please make sure to cherish your life.

283
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,780
Get out first and then decide what
to do.

284
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,260
Okay?

285
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
Is anyone there?

286
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,340
Help!

287
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,860
My stomach hurts.

288
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,180
(Ma Xiaonian, maniac bomber)
Let me out!

289
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,060
Help!

290
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,380
Let me out!

291
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,340
Master You.

292
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,260
What are you doing here?

293
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,220
I should be asking you that.

294
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,460
Kid,

295
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,180
you've been in here three times this year.

296
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,100
Don't tell me

297
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,500
you've turned over a new leaf.

298
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,380
It's hard to make a living.

299
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,620
I have to do some strenuous work first.

300
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,460
Stop talking nonsense.

301
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,940
You should know

302
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,100
that in this prison,

303
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,620
nothing

304
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,500
gets past me.

305
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
Yes.

306
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,700
You are here for Qin Huole.

307
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,860
You want to find him...

308
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,300
Right, Master You.

309
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,020
Tell me, where is he?

310
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,060
The confinement room.

311
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,660
The confinement room?

312
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,300
Didn't he just come in this morning?

313
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,380
Do you want me to stay here

314
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,500
and explain the whole story

315
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,820
to you in detail,

316
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,660
or do you want

317
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,540
to save him right away?

318
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,860
Right away, immediately.

319
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,660
Then what are you waiting for? Move!

320
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,580
Wait, what should I do?

321
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,940
You idiot.

322
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,420
How can you save him like that?

323
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,140
Move this thing away.

324
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,260
Alright.

325
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,980
I've told you all before.

326
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,420
It's not that I can't go out.

327
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,700
I just don't want to.

328
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,420
Master You.

329
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,020
I want to go out.

330
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,260
Please.
