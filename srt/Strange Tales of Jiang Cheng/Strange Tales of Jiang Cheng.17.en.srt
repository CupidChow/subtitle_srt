2
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,690
He took Han Da and Xu San'er

3
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,250
to Panlong Hill,

4
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,050
and designed everything.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,050
Then he rushed to Yuan Lake,

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,660
entered the bamboo cage
he had prepared in advance,

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,770
and without hesitation,

8
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,970
he ended his own life.

9
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,550
Mr. Che

10
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,940
thus became the hero

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,660
in the mute girl's heart.

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,450
Jingwen killed himself,

13
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,400
with his life as a bargaining chip.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,310
The purpose

15
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,410
is for this mute girl

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,010
to find hope.

17
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,660
What Mr. Che did

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,340
is like the Buddha who feeds the eagle
with his flesh.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,970
Amitabha.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,200
Miss,

21
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,690
Mr. Che became Cheng Sen

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,380
for you,

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,010
so you must live with hope,

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
okay?

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
How does it look?

26
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,710
Is it okay?

27
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,010
Move a bit to the right.

28
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
How about now?

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
That's good.

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,600
Huole.

31
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,670
Huole.

32
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,830
What are you thinking about?

33
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,110
I'm wondering

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,690
if we have

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,280
idealized something

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,130
during our investigation.

37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,170
What do you mean?

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,290
Mr. Che's actions.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,250
Are you doubting Mr. Che's intentions?

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
A person can give up his own life

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,340
to help others.

42
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,270
This is his morals.

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,730
- I didn't mean that.
- You all saw it too.

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,540
Even someone like Huo Qingxin

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,870
was moved

46
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,710
by Mr. Che's actions.

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,290
He brought the mute girl to the city

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,290
and even swore to us

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,060
that he would take good care of her.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,570
The evildoers

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,130
received their deserved punishment,

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,660
and Mr. Che also paid with his life.

53
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,400
I hope

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,880
you don't look at him

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,140
like you do a murderer.

56
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,990
Xiaofan.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Do you have

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,540
more doubts?

59
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,260
I'm just thinking,

60
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,730
would such a person

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,460
really kill someone

62
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,340
just to punish others?

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,810
The piano music is a bit depressing.

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,960
The case is solved.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,490
Shouldn't you be happy?

66
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,970
I always feel

67
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,120
that something is wrong about this case.

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
Didn't you say that if my injustice

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
could be redressed,

70
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,630
there's nothing in this world

71
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,470
that can stump you?

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,360
What? Does something

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,290
stump you already?

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
Dad,

75
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,600
I want to know

76
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
what exactly Che Jingwen said to you

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
that day at the teahouse.

78
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,270
Was there nothing else

79
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,410
Mr. Che wanted to discuss with you?

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
He...

81
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,020
You smart kid,

82
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,660
I really can't hide anything from you.

83
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,190
That day,

84
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,290
he did ask me one question.

85
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,870
Lawyer Qin,

86
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,260
if you wanted to bring down

87
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,410
someone much more powerful
than yourself,

88
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,340
what would you do?

89
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,110
It's simple.

90
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,900
Be prepared to sacrifice your own life.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,640
So you had already guessed

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,100
that Che Jingwen
might commit suicide?

93
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,100
I don't have that kind of ability.

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
I just felt that this case

95
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,460
was not as simple as it seemed.

96
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,040
I didn't want to use this information

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,930
to mislead you.

98
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,190
Wait a minute.

99
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,460
Bringing down someone much more powerful
than yourself.

100
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,540
This doesn't make sense.

101
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,700
Han Da was just a teahouse manager.

102
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
Even with
the traveling doctor Xu San'er,

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,170
they wouldn't be enough
to worry Mr. Che.

104
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,810
Thank you for your honesty.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,850
I still stand by what I said.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,490
I can redress your injustice.

107
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,480
There's no case in this world

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,930
that can stump me.

109
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,540
(Wuyuxuan Teahouse)

110
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,750
Is anyone here?

111
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,140
(No traces of any woman living here.)

112
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,290
(Han Da was a bachelor.)

113
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,410
Wait a moment.

114
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,730
Sorry to delay your closing time.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,780
I would like to buy two 100 grams
of Shilixiang new tea.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
It's wrong.

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
It's all wrong.

118
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,730
Maybe from the very beginning,

119
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,370
I went down the wrong path.

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,970
Don't worry, Hongyu.

121
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,300
(Han Da's wife)
This will earn you

122
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,860
(Hong Yu, singer from Huanyinglou)
more than being a singer at Huanyinglou.

123
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,360
Don't mention this to anyone.

124
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,540
After all, the idea

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,780
was yours.

126
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,120
Go to a place

127
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,860
where no one knows you

128
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,090
and find a kind person

129
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,480
to live a good life.

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,980
I will leave Jiangzhou tonight.

131
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,910
Sir,

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,170
isn't this a bit too much?

133
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,930
She may

134
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,740
get the money.

135
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,740
But she has to be alive to spend it.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,330
- Understood.
- Hai.

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,200
Remember.

138
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,020
Do it clean.

139
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Sir,

140
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,210
rest assured.

141
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,290
I may not be talented,

142
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,570
but I am willing to do my best

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,170
to give this girl

144
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,380
a place to live

145
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,980
for the sake

146
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,450
of my colleague, Jingwen.

147
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,480
I hope

148
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,900
you can give me this opportunity.

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Miss,

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,780
come back to the city with us.

151
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,450
I was wondering why I couldn't find it.

152
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,410
So you took it.

153
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,260
(Huo Residence)

154
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
Who is it?

155
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,810
Mr. Qin.

156
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
Step aside.

157
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,330
Mr. Qin,

158
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,980
what happened?

159
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,500
Mr. Qin,

160
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,980
what are you doing?

161
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,210
Mr. Qin,

162
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,720
what exactly are you looking for?

163
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,140
- Where is she?
- Who?

164
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,660
You know it exactly.

165
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,500
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

166
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,260
Actually, the deaths
of Han Da and Xu San'er

167
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,260
were not part
of Che Jingwen's plan at all.

168
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,290
He just wanted to use his own death

169
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,540
to lead us to your evil deeds.

170
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,090
But you were one step ahead.

171
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,860
Following Che Jingwen's plan,

172
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,500
you killed two more people

173
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,090
and justified yourself.

174
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,920
If I hadn't gone

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,020
to Wuyuxuan Teahouse,

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,140
I would have almost been fooled by you.

177
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,210
So what?

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,090
It really was you.

179
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,240
But you will

180
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,540
never find the evidence.

181
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,930
Han Da's wife,

182
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,150
no,

183
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,500
the fake wife,

184
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,500
has already gone to hell

185
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,900
to find the real Han Da.

186
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,670
As for the mute girl,

187
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,090
didn't you just look for her?

188
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,660
The people who deserve to die

189
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,540
are already dead.

190
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Moreover,

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,380
I have

192
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,360
portrayed Che Jingwen

193
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,210
as a revered hero.

194
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,570
What a touching ending it is.

195
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,070
Why do you add unnecessary details?

196
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,620
But facts are facts.

197
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,980
No matter how you cover it up,

198
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,620
it is still fiction.

199
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,860
You wanted Che Jingwen's help

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,290
with your novel.

201
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,170
After being rejected several times,

202
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,500
you were unwilling to give up.

203
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,660
So you pestered him

204
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,260
like a persistent leech.

205
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,660
While following Che Jingwen,

206
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,240
you discovered the beautiful mute girl

207
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,620
in the tea garden

208
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,290
and developed lustful thoughts.

209
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,070
But due to your hard-earned reputation,

210
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,140
you didn't dare to act rashly.

211
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,440
I guess you must have gotten to know

212
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,500
Han Da and Xu San'er

213
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,900
through that fake wife.

214
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,540
Red dragon.

215
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,740
Pong.

216
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,480
(Huanyinglou)
You all had the same rotten tastes,

217
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,140
so you immediately colluded together.

218
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,900
Mr. Huo, it's your turn.

219
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,990
Mr. Huo.

220
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,550
Mr. Huo.

221
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,520
Mr. Huo.

222
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,740
It's just a mute girl.

223
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,570
Leave her to me.

224
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,190
At Huanyinglou,

225
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,760
we have plenty of ways

226
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,780
to deal with such a novice.

227
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,780
After a discussion,

228
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,980
you went to the tea mountain.

229
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,150
Let's go.

230
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
Just like that,

231
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,380
you defiled the mute girl's purity

232
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,540
and destroyed Che Jingwen's last hope.

233
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,400
Impressive, Detective Qin.

234
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,520
You really told a brilliant story.

235
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,950
In the future, you can join me

236
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,170
in writing novels.

237
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,990
I guess

238
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,540
Che Jingwen must have come to see you.

239
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,090
Otherwise,

240
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,330
why would he be so desperate

241
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,260
to use his death to expose your crimes?

242
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,410
Well, Jingwen

243
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,260
was just too idealistic.

244
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,690
However,

245
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,810
I didn't do anything to him.

246
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,110
On the contrary,

247
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,810
I kindly

248
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,810
gave him some advice.

249
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,450
Jingwen.

250
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,210
How did you know about this?

251
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,050
Did the mute girl tell you?

252
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,630
No.

253
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,110
She didn't know.

254
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,920
I saw it myself

255
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,330
that you left the tea garden.

256
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,020
It's okay.

257
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,660
It's not important.

258
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,090
I drank too much.

259
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,980
It's all in the past.

260
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,210
Jingwen,

261
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,240
today I want to tell you something

262
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,540
from the heart.

263
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,020
Look,

264
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,430
don't always be so aloof.

265
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,540
Look at yourself.

266
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,860
It's been 20 years.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
You're still just an ordinary teacher.

268
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,930
When you leave,

269
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,910
you can report it.

270
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,500
Who would believe you without evidence?

271
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,810
Mayflies

272
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,620
cannot shake a big tree.

273
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,380
As for me,

274
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,860
I still appreciate your talent.

275
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,400
The ideas you gave me

276
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,740
are all great.

277
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,540
I could say,

278
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,780
without you,

279
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,930
I wouldn't have become

280
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,170
a great writer.

281
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,320
So,

282
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,860
keep helping me.

283
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,170
Let's make money together.

284
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,540
It's just a girl.

285
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,620
I'll take you to Huanyinglou.

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,780
You can choose anyone.

287
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,210
Heaven is unkind.

288
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,740
Heaven is unkind.

289
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,900
Heaven is unkind.

290
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,210
Heaven is unkind!

291
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,690
As soon as Mr. Che's corpse
was discovered,

292
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,450
you understood his intention

293
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,290
and immediately worked out a countermeasure.

294
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,460
Blank letter, brush pen,

295
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,490
the bribed singer,

296
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,320
the legend of making medicine from humans,

297
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,470
and Xiaofan's admiration

298
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,570
for Che Jingwen.

299
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,750
With all these,

300
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,540
you weaved a huge net

301
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,840
and then step by step,

302
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,180
led us into the trap.

303
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,980
It cannot be denied

304
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,330
that compared to your lousy novels,

305
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,190
(The Death Lantern)

306
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,030
this one

307
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,260
clearly shows more skills.

308
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,890
Che Jingwen didn't kill Han Da

309
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,220
and Xu San'er.

310
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,260
You man did.

311
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,260
(The second target will die
at 8 p.m. on April 19th.)
