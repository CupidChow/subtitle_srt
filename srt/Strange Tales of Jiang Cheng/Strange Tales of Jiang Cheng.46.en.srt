=Episode 46=

2
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,550
Please.

3
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,960
Mr. Huo.

4
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,450
I'm expecting you.

5
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,850
Master Sanbao.

6
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,570
I have never

7
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,790
offended you.

8
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,930
What are you afraid of?

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,260
I have no interest

10
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,360
in what you are doing at all.

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,540
But Master You.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,840
Today, I should look at you

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,060
with new eyes.

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,930
You have hidden yourself well.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
You really deserve to be a master.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,020
If you want to leave,

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,500
it can be achieved.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,650
There is one condition.

19
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,910
What?

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,780
You can't tell anyone about this.

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,910
If you want to leave,

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,740
leave alone.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,810
That's not possible.

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,130
Master You, you know,

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,710
I have a group of followers

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,020
who have been through thick and thin
with me.

27
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,580
I've told you

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,040
if you want to leave,

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,460
leave alone.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,440
Master You.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,690
You should know

32
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,340
that now I am giving you a chance.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,900
Do you understand?

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,440
Fine.

35
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,110
Do as you wish.

36
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,830
Remember.

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,580
No matter what happens,

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,340
always respect the elders.

39
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,510
You

40
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,340
killed him?

41
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,070
Don't worry.

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,440
I know what I'm doing.

43
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
He won't die.

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,790
He just has to

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,730
spend two months bedridden.

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,130
Now take the key and go save Huole.

47
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,790
Okay.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,020
What about him?

49
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,210
What do you mean?

50
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,920
When you helped Qin Huole escape,

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,530
Sanbao found out and you stabbed him.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,510
Don't worry.

53
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,780
I'll report it like this

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,900
to the guards.

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,350
Master You, I have always respected you.

56
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,760
- I have never offended you, right?
- Alright.

57
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Stop talking nonsense.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,370
I help you save Huole

59
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,510
and you take the blame for me.

60
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,970
It is fair enough.

61
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,500
By the way, tell Qin Huole

62
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,130
to help clear my name after he gets out.

63
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,230
I can't stay here

64
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,690
after this incident.

65
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,230
What are you waiting for?

66
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,450
Waiting for someone to catch you?

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,950
- Mr. Huo.
- Just call me Huo.

68
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,790
Captain Chen.

69
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,910
Huo.

70
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,550
Before going to prison,

71
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,340
you were a celebrity in Jiangzhou.

72
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,640
There were countless people

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,780
knowing you.

74
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,160
So this time,

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
assigning you to this job

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,060
is indeed a bit risky.

77
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,450
But you also know

78
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,250
that Ding Mao is detained
at the police station now

79
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,400
and cannot be transferred

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,500
to our prison.

81
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,690
- So...
- No need to explain.

82
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,830
(Huo Qingxin, novelist)
The previous Huo Qingxin

83
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,230
died at the moment

84
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,100
he entered

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,450
Jiangzhou prison.

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
Now

87
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,150
Night God released me

88
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,580
with the excuse of treating my illness.

89
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,060
Even if I have to go through fire
and water,

90
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,860
I wouldn't hesitate.

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,860
I just hope to assist Night God

92
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,450
in accomplishing the great cause.

93
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,570
Did you bring the item?

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,100
With this thing,

95
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,890
our operation should be foolproof.

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,100
Don't get too excited now.

97
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,420
Better safe than sorry.

98
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,010
Have you found the right person?

99
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,660
I'll take you to see him.

100
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
Sir.

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,420
The smell here is unpleasant.

102
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,470
You're an officer.

103
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,180
Please go outside to have a smoke
and get some fresh air.

104
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,420
I'll bring more tomorrow.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
Buddy,

106
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,450
you're smarter than the former worker.

107
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,690
You are good.

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
Huole.

109
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Hey.

110
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,430
Shh.

111
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,080
What are you doing here?

112
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,430
Captain Song asked me to rescue you.

113
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,860
After being in prison for so long,

114
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,100
this is my first time coming to this zone.

115
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,370
When Duan was here,

116
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,770
I can't take you around.

117
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,890
It's a pity that we didn't recruit him

118
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,220
into our ranks.

119
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,540
Let's go. I'll take you out.

120
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,710
Okay.

121
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,510
Someone's here.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,130
Everyone has their own aspirations.
You can't force it.

123
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,180
Just like in Jiangzhou,

124
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,750
everyone knows you

125
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,500
are a greedy detective novelist.

126
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,860
But who would have thought

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,300
that you are now a member
of the Night God Society?

128
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,450
Isn't it the same for you, Captain Chen?

129
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,070
What should we do?

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,250
Well, you are destined for a great cause.

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
Let's switch clothes.

132
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,690
I stay, and you go out.

133
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,770
How will you get away then?

134
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,150
Don't worry.

135
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,270
Even without it,

136
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,500
I can still get out.

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,080
Don't hesitate.

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,330
If you hesitate, we'll both be doomed.

139
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,950
Ma Xiaonian,

140
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
I've been talking for a while.

141
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,330
Have you made up your mind?

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
This is your only chance

143
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,540
to get out of here.

144
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,620
I still hold the same idea.

145
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,430
Even though you have no interest

146
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,270
in joining us,

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,450
we can still cooperate.

148
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,620
As long as you agree,

149
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,770
after it's done,

150
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,690
I guarantee you'll be able
to escape far away.

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,180
What if I don't agree?

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,960
Unless you want to stay here
until you die.

153
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,890
With your crimes,

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,400
you can never

155
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,250
get out of this prison.

156
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,930
And let me tell you.

157
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,720
I have a hundred ways here

158
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,930
to make you be better off dead.

159
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,370
I can let you try them all.

160
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,980
I hate being threatened the most.

161
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,660
Now this is a threat.

162
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,270
What's wrong?

163
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,390
Huo, you're a civil man.

164
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,440
You talk to him.

165
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
How did it go?

166
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,070
Nothing.

167
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,990
(Huo Qingxin?)

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,620
(Why is he teaming up with Chen Zou?)

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
(He's dressed like this?)

170
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,460
(There must be something odd.)

171
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,980
I think

172
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,370
no matter how many reasons you give,

173
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,960
nothing is more convincing

174
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,170
than putting

175
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,170
what he desires

176
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,460
in front of him.

177
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,470
Ma Xiaonian,

178
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
I know

179
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,500
you're so longing

180
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,770
for the moment of explosion.

181
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,170
Since that's the case,

182
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,500
why suppress yourself?

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
You should know

184
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,130
that once you miss the opportunity,

185
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,250
you might never have it again

186
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,530
in this life.

187
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,820
I need a quiet room,

188
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,170
food,

189
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,750
and water.

190
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,820
No one is allowed to disturb me.

191
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
No problem.

192
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,860
I'll clear out the warden's office
for you.

193
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,010
I also need wires,

194
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,130
batteries,

195
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,230
and fuses.

196
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
You can have

197
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,750
all of them.

198
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,250
I want to start now.

199
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Wait.

200
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,470
Captain.

201
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,500
Where are you taking Ma Xiaonian?

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,770
He's a death row inmate.

203
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,400
None of your business.

204
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,740
- But...
- Move aside!

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Hey.

206
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,230
- Are you done yet?
- Almost.

207
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,100
Hurry up.

208
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,820
When you're done, come to my office

209
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,230
and I'll let you pass.

210
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,910
Are you crazy? Why did you come back?

211
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,250
Quick, give me back my clothes.

212
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,740
What are you trying to do?

213
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,370
I have a more important task for you.

214
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,400
Listen carefully.

215
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,750
Once you're out, find Song He
immediately.

216
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,530
Tell him that Chen Zou killed Duan Ming.

217
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,880
There might be an upheaval
in the prison.

218
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,520
And Huo Qingxin

219
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,940
brought dynamite into the prison.

220
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,040
Ask him to investigate

221
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,290
Huo Qingxin's recent activities.

222
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,590
What are you saying?

223
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Dynamite?

224
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
I must go to the warden's office

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
to find out what Huo Qingxin
and his group are planning

226
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,630
and where the target is.

227
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,750
So, you need to help me find You Youyou.

228
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,340
Without his help, I can't do it alone.

229
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,130
Alright, I'll definitely
deliver the message.

230
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,260
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

231
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,280
Captain Song.

232
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,340
- How's it going?
- Captain Song.

233
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,910
Why are you alone?

234
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,750
Where is Qin Huole?

235
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,740
- He...
- Speak.

236
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,640
He's fine.

237
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,620
He asked me to tell you

238
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,480
to investigate the novelist Huo Qingxin,

239
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,220
especially his activities
in the past few days.

240
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,030
This guy brought a box of dynamite

241
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,500
and gave it to that maniac bomber
Ma Xiaonian.

242
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,600
- What?
- Huo Qingxin? How is that possible?

243
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,940
Isn't he in Jiangzhou prison?

244
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,220
Cheng Tianlang, don't talk nonsense
here.

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,750
I put my life on the line

246
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,700
and risk my life for you all,

247
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,890
but you don't believe me.

248
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,750
Captain Song, even if you don't
believe me,

249
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,030
you should at least believe Huole.

250
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,460
He urgently asked me to inform you.

251
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,520
If he's in a hurry,

252
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,870
it must be something important.

253
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,710
It can't be delayed.

254
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,220
So the person I saw earlier

255
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
was Huo Qingxin indeed.

256
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,890
What are you mumbling about, Mao?

257
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,870
Captain.

258
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,620
When I was patrolling today,

259
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,370
I think I saw Huo Qingxin.

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,500
But later when we checked the area,

261
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,700
we found nothing.

262
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,990
You even said you were wrong.

263
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,800
No, I said my eyesight was fine.

264
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,940
There's no way I saw it wrong.

265
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,110
Captain, I'm sure I saw Huo Qingxin.

266
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,840
Right at the entrance
of Youlong Gambling House.

267
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,030
It's a newly opened branch

268
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,050
of Jushangfang now.

269
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,080
(Jushangfang Branch)

270
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
The Youlong Gambling House

271
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,620
just turned into Jushangfang like this.

272
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,470
Chen Zheng.

273
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,940
Look at that person.

274
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,700
Why does he look so familiar?

275
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,470
Which one?

276
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,500
The one carrying the suitcase.

277
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,590
It's odd.

278
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,990
If Chen didn't happen to

279
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,990
have a stomachache,

280
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,410
I would have stopped Huo Qingxin.

281
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,060
Why did you have to have a stomachache

282
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,130
at that moment?

283
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,290
You lazy donkey.

284
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,520
Sorry, Captain.

285
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,710
It's all my fault.

286
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,250
It's too late to say it now.

287
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,100
Mao, come with me to Jushangfang.

288
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Yes, sir.

289
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,580
Captain, what about me?

290
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,530
Qin Huole will definitely find a way
to contact me again.

291
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
You stay here.

292
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,800
Don't go anywhere.

293
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,710
If he has any news,

294
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
have Cheng Tianlang notify me
immediately.

295
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,680
Understood.

296
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,220
Captain Song, isn't this wrong?

297
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,010
In just half a day,

298
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,890
my role has switched from a vanguard
to a runner.

299
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,890
You guys are really kicking away
the ladder.

300
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,410
Hey, in a battle between two armies,

301
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,720
what's the most important thing?

302
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,650
Sending intelligence.

303
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,010
It's an important task.

304
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,370
I can only entrust it to you.

305
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,990
Can you relay the newest information

306
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,130
to me as soon as possible?

307
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm counting on you.

308
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,800
Don't worry.

309
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,250
I'm fleet-footed in Jiangzhou.

310
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,470
No problem.

311
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,220
It's almost time.

312
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,770
Alright, you go first.

313
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,100
Once Ma Xiaonian is done,

314
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,700
I'll bring him to meet up with you.

315
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
All the best.

316
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,250
All the best.

317
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,560
Captain,

318
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,870
bad news.

319
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,410
What happened? Why are you so flustered?

320
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,750
Sanbao

321
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,340
got stabbed.

322
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,980
