=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 22=

2
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,670
Seven years ago,

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,630
three kidnappers were caught in a crossfire

4
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,970
with a patrol team

5
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,660
and fled towards Green Bay.

6
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,950
Later,

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,560
the police dispatched a large force

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,540
to search nearby,

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,330
but they found nothing.

10
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,830
I think

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,970
you must have helped them.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,250
Are they really your children?

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,970
What happened exactly?

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,020
It was my momentary lapse

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,460
that caused this great disaster.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,540
That day,

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,690
I was about to go fishing.

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,570
I saved him.

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,450
But when he woke up,

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,340
he couldn't remember anything,

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,010
nor did he remember who he was.

22
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,900
I never married in my life

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,450
and had no children.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,380
Where is this place?

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,620
Green Bay.

26
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,340
Do you know who I am?

27
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,380
Think carefully.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,780
I don't remember.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,620
Your name is

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,620
Xiulai.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,970
Tian Xiulai.

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,850
I'm Tian Dahe. You're my son.

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,110
Later on,

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,570
the police came

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,730
to search for water bandits.

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,500
When I found him,

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,100
he had a gunshot wound on his leg.

38
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,130
I suspected that he had a dirty past.

39
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,130
But he had already lost his memory,

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,060
so I treated him as my own son.

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,910
Have you found any suspicious people

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,850
around here recently?

43
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,400
No suspicious people.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
No?

45
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,170
This child

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,970
was very good

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,130
and took good care of me.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,690
So I put his background

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,620
out of my mind.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,220
What about the other two?

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
This

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,730
must be a mistake.

53
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,990
Back then,

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,100
I only saved Wu Bing.

55
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,780
(Grave of My Brothers, Wu Yi and Wu Jia)

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,900
No, that's not right.

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
You told me clearly

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,580
there were three people on the phone.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,610
Who are you?

60
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,660
Who are you?

61
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,780
If you dare hang up again,

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,200
I'll kill that girl right now.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,340
If you dare hang up again,

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,050
I'll kill that girl right now.

65
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,220
They sounded like three people.

66
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,340
So useless.

67
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,260
- So useless.
- But they are not.

68
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,120
Alright, Brother.

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,140
What I mean is,

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,020
that's another world.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,150
A world that we ordinary people

72
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,970
cannot perceive with the naked eye.

73
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,930
But for him,

74
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,700
it is extremely real

75
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,190
and believable.

76
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,150
If you don't want to drink, then never.

77
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,610
If you don't drink, then never.

78
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,460
Leave it to me.

79
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,050
Leave it to me.

80
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,540
(Dear heroic mother, Zhan Ruhua
Dear heroic father, Zhen Jianglong)

81
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,820
(Grave of My Brothers, Wu Yi and Wu Jia)

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Wu Bing

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,170
should be a schizophrenic patient.

84
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,930
His two brothers are his delusions.

85
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,410
He has been switching roles

86
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,580
and communicating with each other.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Wait a minute.

88
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,920
I have a question.

89
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,190
Sir,

90
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,580
since you had hidden it from him
for seven years,

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,710
why did you

92
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,550
tell him the truth?

93
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,110
I...

94
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,580
I feel uneasy.

95
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,990
I...

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,170
Father, eat.

97
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
Father.

98
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,970
Father, what's wrong?

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,410
I'm fine.

100
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,700
Son.

101
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,810
There's something I've wanted to tell you
for a long time.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,970
I'm not your father.

103
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,170
Father, why did you bring me here?

104
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,970
Xiulai,

105
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,220
there's something

106
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,910
that I have always hidden from you.

107
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,020
Actually,

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,290
you had two brothers.

109
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,630
They

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,290
were buried here.

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,040
Xiulai.

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Xiulai.

113
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,630
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,480
Xiulai.

115
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,810
Xiulai, what's wrong with you? Xiulai.

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,810
Xiulai.

117
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,580
Xiulai!

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,780
I'm not Xiulai.

119
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,610
I'm Wu Bing.

120
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,220
I have a serious illness

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,970
and my days are numbered.

122
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,290
But Wu Bing has been by my side

123
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,290
for seven years.

124
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,810
I am content.

125
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,160
Do you think

126
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,680
a person can really

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,760
go so far

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,690
in their own delusions?

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,450
Wu Bing has strong feelings

130
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,260
and deeply relies on his two brothers.

131
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,500
Seven years ago, he lost his memory
due to an injury.

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,450
When he regained his memory,

133
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,260
he learned that his two brothers
had died.

134
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,410
He couldn't accept this reality,

135
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,620
which caused him
to have a mental breakdown.

136
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,380
In Wu Bing's mind,

137
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,170
only by recreating past scenes

138
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,140
could Wu Jia and Wu Yi exist.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,260
To maintain their existence,

140
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,620
he needed to turn those past scenes

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,930
into reality.

142
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,330
In other words,

143
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,980
he kidnapped Niannian

144
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,690
to continue coexisting

145
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,720
with Wu Jia and Wu Yi?

146
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,450
In Wu Bing's subconscious,

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
the split personalities of Wu Jia
and Wu Yi

148
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,380
are different.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
These two personalities

150
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,260
are extremely dangerous.

151
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,540
Based on yesterday's phone call,

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,980
it can be determined
that they hold absolute dominance.

153
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,620
So who exactly is Wu Bing?

154
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,380
Just consider Wu Jia and Wu Yi
as still alive.

155
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,190
Wu Bing's body

156
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,380
contains all three of them.

157
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,690
So we still don't understand

158
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,090
why the three brothers

159
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,330
kidnapped He Yinyin,

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,410
Bai Xiaoyan,

161
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,290
and Hu Asheng.

162
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,210
We need to ask Mr. He.

163
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,950
(Bandits Zhen Jianglong and Zhan Ruhua)
Mr. He,

164
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,090
(were both brought to justice.)
Mr. He,

165
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,860
the person who reported the bandits
seven years ago

166
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,090
- was you, right?
- Yes, it was me.

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,400
But what does this have to do

168
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
with my daughter's kidnap?

169
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,360
Mr. He, how were the bandits

170
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,690
caught back then?

171
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,750
Do you still remember?

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,140
Back then in Jiangzhou,

173
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,860
I was one of the wealthiest people.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,020
This couple tried every means
to follow me,

175
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,050
but they accidentally
exposed themselves.

176
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,260
After I reported them to the police,

177
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,480
the detective squad set up a dragnet

178
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,640
to catch them successfully.

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,450
I went to the other two victims' homes.

180
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,310
When Hu Asheng was murdered,

181
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,150
he was 12 years old.

182
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,480
His parents

183
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,170
ran a blacksmith shop.

184
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,570
Bai Xiaoyan was two years older
than Hu Asheng.

185
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,980
Her parents were teachers
at Sicun Middle School.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,640
When the detective squad
arrested the bandits,

187
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
out of a sense of justice,

188
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
both families

189
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,950
had assisted the police.

190
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,330
Is doing good deeds wrong?

191
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,620
Of course, it is not wrong.

192
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,290
But for the Wu brothers,

193
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,480
you were indirectly responsible

194
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,930
for destroying their family.

195
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,900
Zhen Jianglong and Zhan Ruhua,

196
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,410
these two bandits,

197
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,170
were the biological parents
of the three brothers.

198
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,510
This

199
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,140
is their motive for the crime.

200
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,260
Why haven't they returned yet?

201
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,050
Captain, Captain.

202
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
We found it.

203
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,540
(Jiangzhou Police Station Report)

204
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,780
The arrest of Zhen Jianglong
and his wife.

205
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,910
Seven years ago,

206
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,170
the bandits Zhen Jianglong and Zhan Ruhua

207
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,190
were stalking a wealthy merchant
named He

208
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,200
with malicious intentions,

209
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,860
but were detected by He's maid.

210
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,290
She then reported it
to the detective squad.

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,070
The detective squad immediately
sent out a team to capture them.

212
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,090
Come quickly, they are here.

213
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,020
The bandit couple resisted fiercely.

214
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,190
They got into a fierce battle
in Yuegu Alley

215
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,600
in the south of the city
and nearby areas.

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Stop.

217
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,330
- Stop.
- Stop!

218
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,310
- Hurry.
- Honey, don't linger in the fight.

219
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,150
Run quickly.

220
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I can't leave you here

221
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,080
alone.

222
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,450
Run quickly.

223
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,500
Honey, don't worry.

224
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,810
After I finish the matter,

225
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,980
I'll come back for you.

226
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,810
For some reason,

227
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,570
Zhen Jianglong returned.

228
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,920
While the detective squad was escorting

229
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,050
Zhan Ruhua,

230
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,210
he attacked them.

231
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't move.

232
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,280
Afterwards,

233
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,990
Zhen Jianglong refused to explain
where he went.

234
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,870
In the following days,

235
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,220
the detective squad searched everywhere

236
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,090
in the direction Zhen Jianglong fled,

237
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,620
but had no clue.

238
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,400
I guess Zhen Jianglong went to
give instructions

239
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,240
to the three brothers.

240
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,810
Considering the timing,

241
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,880
their family should be located

242
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,980
near the alley.

243
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,050
Quick, help me open the map.

244
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,790
Look here.

245
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,190
We've already searched the area

246
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,400
around the public telephone booth.

247
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,780
Mao Shuai and his team are still searching.

248
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,150
Look.

249
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,520
Yuegu Alley is a long alley

250
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,780
running east to west.

251
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,840
The public telephone booth
is in the northern part of the alley.

252
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,410
According to the original files,

253
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,900
we know that after the detective squad
arrested Zhen Jianglong and his wife,

254
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,620
they searched the areas
along their escape route,

255
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,330
which is the west of Yuegu Alley.

256
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,860
But they found nothing.

257
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,550
The southern part is too far
from the telephone booth.

258
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,330
It is beyond
their psychological safety zone.

259
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,930
So, there's only one area left,

260
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,660
which is north of Yuegu Alley,

261
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,020
and east of the public telephone booth.

262
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,960
But,

263
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,000
if the hideout is in this area,

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,520
Zhen Jianglong would need to take a detour

265
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,930
to the rear of the detective squad.

266
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,930
That's why

267
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,380
their hideout hasn't been discovered.

268
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,290
Sometimes, people fall into
psychological traps.

269
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,550
They think Zhen Jianglong's hideout

270
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,690
is within his escape range.

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,840
Captain Song,

272
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,980
the Temple of Guan Yu in that direction
is suspicious.

273
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,790
I think I heard something.

274
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,170
- But as I was about to go with Mao...
- Let's go.

275
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
Kid.

276
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,110
Kid, are you alright?

277
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
Kid.

278
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,870
Mother.

279
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,680
Mother.

280
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,000
Sir.

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,330
I beg you. Let me out, please.

282
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,170
I miss my mother.

283
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,410
Alright.

284
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,980
I will take you out.

285
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,630
Wu Bing,

286
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,090
what are you doing?

287
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,260
Sir.

288
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,100
