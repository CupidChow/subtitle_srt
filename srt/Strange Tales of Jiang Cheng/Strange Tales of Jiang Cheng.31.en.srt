=Episode 31=

2
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,890
This...

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,100
Murder!

4
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,460
- Murder!
- Murder!

5
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,270
- Murder!
- Murder!

6
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,130
Murder!

7
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,610
Murder!

8
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,110
Murder!

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,080
Someone's dead!

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,300
Run. Quick!

11
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,780
(Theater panic. The desert is beautiful
because somewhere it hides a well.)

12
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,220
Commander, it was my negligence.

13
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,200
I will have the detective squad
investigate it immediately.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,540
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,780
(Mantangchun Theater)

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,690
Everyone, listen up.

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,800
From now on, lock down the theater.

18
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,680
Without my orders,

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,940
no one is allowed to enter or leave.

20
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,110
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,960
Captain, it's weird.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,200
I've watered him over 20 times.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,290
Yet he shows no reaction at all.

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
Is he awake?

25
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,990
No.

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,450
I just went backstage.

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,870
On the dressing table,

28
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,990
I found half a bowl of pear soup.

29
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,250
It has the scent of datura.

30
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,970
There are many species of datura.

31
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,690
They all are toxic, without exception.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,130
During its growth,

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,590
it usually emits

34
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,620
a sweet fragrance.

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,800
Tea brewed

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,290
from its seeds or leaves

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,780
also has a very enticing scent.

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,710
If datura is mixed

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,660
into pear soup,

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
it'll not spoil the soup,

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,100
but will make it more tasty.

42
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,730
This makes people addicted to it.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,380
You mean,

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,560
before committing the crime,

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,410
he was already poisoned.

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,130
The toxicity of datura

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,360
is quite unique.

48
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,240
It causes dizziness,

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,270
thirst, and burning sensation,

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,010
as well as blurred vision, racing thoughts,

51
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,100
delirium, delusion,

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,800
and unconsciousness in severe cases.

53
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,100
No wonder he can't wake up.

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
What's this?

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,100
Emetic medicine.

56
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,550
Stinky pills.

57
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,410
- Open his mouth.
- Yes.

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,870
Captain Song,

59
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,830
I've said it many times.

60
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,460
I have no enmity with Zhao Xuanxue.

61
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,880
I didn't intend to kill her.

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Besides, even if I wanted to kill her,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,150
(Cheng Zhiyuan from the Chunshou Troupe)
why would I do it in public?

64
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,610
Think about it carefully again.

65
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,190
Who handed you

66
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,730
the murder weapon?

67
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,160
I really can't recall.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,580
Captain Song, please,

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,960
stop pushing me,

70
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,810
okay?

71
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,630
Okay.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,610
I'll ask you a question you can recall.

73
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,700
Who proposed

74
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,990
to have a performance in Jiangzhou?

75
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,340
It was the troupe leader

76
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,540
Chen Shouting's idea.

77
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,930
Where was your former stop?

78
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,920
Ningcheng.

79
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,580
After the performance
in Ningcheng ended,

80
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,580
did anything unusual happen?

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,970
I recall it now.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,660
That day at Ningcheng Inn...

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,610
How many times have I told you?

84
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,220
This is your fate.

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,810
You have to accept it.

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,700
But I don't want to perform anymore.

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,950
From the first day on stage,

88
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,020
I have never liked it.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,830
Why do you keep pushing me

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,470
to a dead end?

91
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,780
Back then, I spent a lot of money

92
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,400
to buy you.

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,240
You know?

94
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,810
If you don't perform,

95
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,640
(Chen Shouting, leader of the Troupe)
how can I support

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,700
the Chunshou Troupe?

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,970
I can promise you.

98
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,850
As long as you don't make me
go on stage anymore,

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,630
from now on,

100
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,460
I'll work hard

101
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,020
to repay you.

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,810
Even if I sell you to a brothel,

103
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,660
you still won't be able to repay it.

104
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,540
Then just you wait.

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,610
When we get to Jiangzhou,

106
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
watch how I personally

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,760
destroy your Chunshou Troupe.

108
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
You...

109
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,930
Why didn't Zhao Xuanxue

110
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,710
want to go on stage?

111
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,550
About this,

112
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,600
you should ask Leader Chen directly.

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,470
I'm asking you.

114
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,310
Answer me.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,460
Leader Chen wanted to keep her
like a rare commodity.

116
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,040
If some high officials or nobles

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,120
fell in love with Zhao Xuanxue,

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,170
he could enjoy wealth and honor
for the rest of his life.

119
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,010
Take him away.

120
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,850
What are you doing?

122
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,970
Come, help me out.

123
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,110
How should I help?

124
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,540
Lie down like me.

125
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,070
Close your eyes.

126
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,510
Now,

127
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,930
I need you to help me recall

128
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,490
Zhao Xuanxue's detailed expressions

129
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,730
before the incident.

130
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,970
The more specific, the better.

131
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,290
Weren't you also at the scene
during the incident?

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,610
Why do you need me to help you?

133
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,290
When Buddha looks into a bowl of water,

134
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,970
he can find 48,000 insects.

135
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,050
We also have a pair of eyes.

136
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,410
But we may not see all of them.

137
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,750
I see.

138
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,700
Close your eyes.

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,410
Let your mind go back to the incident.

140
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,610
In your eyes,

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,850
what's happening

142
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,490
on the stage?

143
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,100
Zhao Xuanxue seemed a bit off.

144
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,000
Tell me more.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
In the first two times
when Cheng Zhiyuan

146
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,790
lunged at Zhao Xuanxue,

147
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,710
she dodged

148
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,550
easily.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,490
But the third time,

150
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,640
it seemed like...

151
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,330
She didn't want to dodge at all.

152
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Right.

153
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,500
In other words,

154
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,110
Zhao Xuanxue interfered

155
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,860
with her own physiological response.

156
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,620
For such a thing to happen,

157
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,860
there's only one possibility.

158
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,360
That is, she had known

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,540
what was going to happen in advance.

160
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,150
That's impossible.

161
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,190
If she knew

162
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,990
that Cheng Zhiyuan
was going to attack her in advance,

163
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,760
in normal cases,

164
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,330
she would run as far as possible.

165
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,400
Why would she let the dagger

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,540
stab into her chest?

167
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,990
Exactly.

168
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,330
This is

169
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,660
the most baffling aspect of this case.

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,600
How was it going?

171
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,210
Did you get anything from Cheng Zhiyuan?

172
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,410
He first claimed he didn't kill anyone

173
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,740
and that someone framed him.

174
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,150
What about you?

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,210
We have some new findings.

176
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,470
But it's too early

177
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,330
to draw a conclusion.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Who are you

179
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,480
planning to interrogate next?

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
The troupe leader,

181
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,240
Chen Shouting.

182
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,870
Come in.

183
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,270
I am Chen Shouting,

184
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,360
the leader of the Chunshou Troupe.

185
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,550
Thank you all for your hard work.

186
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,390
Thank you.

187
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,390
Leader Chen,

188
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
please sit.

189
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,360
Alright.

190
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,600
Leader Chen,

191
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,410
where are you from?

192
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,090
I'm a cosmopolitan.

193
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,170
- What about your place of origin?
- Jiangzhou.

194
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,860
So, we are from the same hometown.

195
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,260
How long have you been away from here?

196
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,900
Over ten years.

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Leader Chen.

198
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,140
Why did you leave Jiangzhou back then?

199
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,660
I had stayed in one place for too long.

200
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,380
So I wanted to go out.

201
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
Leader Chen.

202
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,110
You should know

203
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,020
if you don't want to tell us,

204
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,290
someone will speak for you.

205
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,900
Now that it happened
in your Chunshou Troupe,

206
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,030
you have an obligation

207
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,290
to cooperate with us to find the truth.

208
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,140
You should understand what I mean.

209
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,860
It's all my fault.

210
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,620
I shouldn't have pushed Xuanxue

211
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,050
so much.

212
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,910
Stop right there.

213
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,550
This is the detention area.

214
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,410
Unauthorized personnel
are not allowed to approach.

215
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,300
(Du Xiaohe from the Chunshou Troupe)
Please make an exception.

216
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,800
This is for Zhiyuan.

217
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
No deliveries allowed.

218
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,880
It's just some rice cake.

219
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,290
- It's nothing.
- Still not allowed.

220
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,390
Go.

221
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,840
Look, it's not poisoned.

222
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,310
It may not be poisoned.

223
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,310
But what if Cheng Zhiyuan

224
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,500
chokes on it?

225
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,790
We can't bear the responsibility

226
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,070
if there's a suicide.

227
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,070
I might even

228
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,910
lose my job.

229
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Take it away.

230
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,380
I don't have much on me.

231
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,740
Put it away.

232
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,090
In broad daylight...

233
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
No, it's evening now.

234
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,380
Still, I can't accept your bribe.

235
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,690
Take your stuff and leave.

236
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,170
Zhiyuan...

237
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
Come on.

238
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,070
Hey, don't cry.

239
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,260
I didn't do anything to you.

240
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,070
Cheng Zhiyuan is a suspect.

241
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,380
There's nothing I can do.

242
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,020
If you really want to save
Cheng Zhiyuan,

243
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,810
go find Captain Song.

244
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,170
If he agrees,

245
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,150
I'll let you see him.

246
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
Alright.

247
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,110
Thank you.

248
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Now go.

249
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,790
I admit

250
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
over the years,

251
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,410
I have been harsh on Xuanxue.

252
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
But...

253
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,630
But...

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,020
But I did that

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,170
all for her own good, right?

256
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,640
Who doesn't want

257
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,540
to rise to the top and become a celebrity?

258
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,720
Take Commander Lei's third mistress

259
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,210
for example.

260
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,520
Back then,

261
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,330
she caught Commander Lei's eye

262
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,690
because she sang so well, right?

263
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,930
You mean

264
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,310
it would be best if Zhao Xuanxue

265
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,930
also caught the eye of some commander?

266
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,110
Of course.

267
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,520
But doesn't that mean

268
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,220
you're treating Zhao Xuanxue
like a commodity?

269
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,140
I finally understand
why she didn't dare to go on stage.

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
If it were me,

271
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,540
I wouldn't either.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
Leader Chen,

273
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,140
based on your understanding,

274
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,270
how is the relationship

275
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,290
between Zhao Xuanxue and Cheng Zhiyuan?

276
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,690
Zhiyuan

277
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,210
would never harm Xuanxue.

278
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,540
Why are you so sure?

279
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,090
If it were you,

280
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,000
could you bear to stab

281
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,780
the person you love?

282
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,930
You mean

283
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,660
Cheng Zhiyuan and Zhao Xuanxue...

284
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,210
They were dating.

285
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Who are you?

286
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,400
My name is Du Xiaohe.

287
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,540
I'm from the Chunshou Troupe.

288
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,410
I'm looking for Captain Song.

289
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,390
Captain Song?

290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
Please, be kind.

291
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,270
I won't take up much of your time.

292
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,110
Just a moment.

293
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,290
Please, I beg you.

294
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,150
Wait a moment.

295
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,950
Everyone knew that Zhiyuan and Xuanxue

296
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,050
were lovers on stage

297
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,330
and off stage.

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,560
Of course,

299
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,240
for the sake of Xuanxue's future,

300
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,660
I wouldn't agree to it.

301
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,910
Who prepared that bowl of pear soup

302
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,750
for Cheng Zhiyuan?

303
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,020
- Pear soup?
- Yes.

304
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,400
The one he drank

305
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
before going on stage.

306
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,740
Wu Xi.

307
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,860
My handyman.

308
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,030
Come in.

309
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
Captain,

310
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,690
a girl named Du Xiaohe
from the troupe is looking for you.

311
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,910
You guys keep questioning.

312
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,750
I'll be right back.

313
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,910
- Captain Song.
- What's the matter?

314
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,900
Captain Song.

315
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,760
Officer Mao said

316
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,170
that only if you agree

317
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,540
can I give this to Zhiyuan.

318
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,030
I told him

319
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,330
that it was not poisoned.

320
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,240
If you don't believe me,

321
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,190
I can prove it to you right now.

322
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,050
Alright, no need.

323
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,480
Give it to me.

324
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,870
Then,

325
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,540
Captain Song,

326
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,450
may I

327
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,330
see Zhiyuan?

328
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,870
I can bring the stuff to him.

329
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,910
But visiting is not allowed.

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,860
Before we find out the cause
of Zhao Xuanxue's death,

331
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,140
not only Cheng Zhiyuan,

332
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,070
but any member of the Chunshou Troupe

333
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,910
is a suspect.

334
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,790
Do you understand?

335
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,790
Yes.

336
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,930
Thank you, Captain Song.

337
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Wait a moment.

338
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,550
Captain Song,

339
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,020
is there anything else?

340
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,550
You should

341
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,360
have spent a lot of time

342
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,680
with Cheng Zhiyuan and Zhao Xuanxue.

343
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,740
Do you know they were lovers?

344
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,540
