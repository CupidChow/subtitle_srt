2
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,620
(Detention Room)
Someone!

3
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,980
Is anyone there?

4
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,730
Has everyone in the police station died?

5
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,420
Someone, come here!

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,760
Quick!

7
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,140
Someone! Is anyone there?

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,810
Where has everyone gone?

9
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,070
Why is it you?

10
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,910
Where is Captain Song?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,090
You really don't want to see me?

12
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,560
You can't even protect yourself
right now.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,670
What's the use of seeing you?

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,870
Hurry up and call Captain Song over.

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,840
It's been several days already.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,010
Why hasn't he let me out?

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
As long as the real murderer
is not caught,

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,810
you won't have peace either.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,270
Master Long considered you his confidant

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,420
for so many years.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,260
Juta hates you the most.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
If you go out now,

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,420
isn't that seeking death?

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,260
If the murderer is never caught,

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,090
am I supposed to be locked up here
for life?

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,070
No, that won't happen.

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,650
It's fine if you're locked up here,

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,000
but I still have to catch Ding Mao

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,900
to prove my innocence.

30
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,240
Right now, my wanted notices

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,210
are all over the streets.

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,920
Alright, have a drink.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
Look,

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,340
we are in the same boat.

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,110
Can you treat me a bit better?

36
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,530
Who is in the same boat as you?

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,250
At least you can still move freely
in the police station.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
But me? I'm locked up here.

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
Well,

40
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,310
it's mainly because I am useful

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,150
in solving the case.

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,530
Are you saying I'm useless?

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,480
I...

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,860
I shouldn't have come to help you.

45
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,370
I didn't ask for you.

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,070
Listen to me.

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,180
Just stop shouting.

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,880
Tonight, besides me,

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,130
no one else will come.

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,410
If you're really bored,

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,580
just pray for Song He

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
and hope

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,990
that he can catch the murderer soon.

54
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,670
Don't move.

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Tianlang,

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,230
last time you ran off on your own.

57
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,980
- That was really disloyal.
- Stop talking nonsense.

58
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,970
Where is the bounty?

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,740
Can I still get it?

60
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,900
- What's the rush?
- Well.

61
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,270
How can I not be rush?

62
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,720
Juta is searching all over Jiangzhou
for me.

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,760
If he catches me, he'll definitely
break both my arms.

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,600
And here you are,

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,370
hiding in the police station

66
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,630
and not coming out.

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,990
Haven't you seen the wanted notices
outside?

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,830
They're all about me.

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,830
Where else can I go?

70
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,810
Stop talking nonsense.

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,460
When will you give me the bounty?

72
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,480
After we catch the murderer.

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,460
When will that be?

74
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,650
I can't say for sure.

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,020
But you can stay here with me.

76
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
At least it's safe.

77
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,890
Safe, my foot.

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,690
Director Xu's guards are resting
in the side hall,

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,540
and besides you, I haven't seen others.

80
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,880
It's my first time strolling

81
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,980
the police station.

82
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,230
There's no special task.

83
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,450
They teamed up to deceive me.

84
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,810
Mr. Xu.

85
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
Dr. Fan.

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,930
Are you here to see Director Xu?

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,010
I know you're feeling down,

88
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,560
but if you keep this up,

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,890
Director Xu will be worried.

90
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,960
You should go quickly.

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,830
Director Xu will be happy

92
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,770
to see you.

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Mr. Xu,

94
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,640
usually

95
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,250
Cao is the one who runs the errands.

96
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,500
Why didn't he come with you today?

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
He's sick.

98
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,590
Don't move.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,540
- Who are you?
- Don't shoot.

100
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,770
I'm really just doing a job for money.

101
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,920
Sir.

102
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,550
It's too late today.

103
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,390
Come back tomorrow.

104
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,940
(Barbershop)
No,

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,980
I must shave today.

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,060
- You...
- Not my hair,

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
but yours.

108
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,540
He seems to have guessed our plan.

109
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,740
Captain, this guy is playing us.

110
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,420
No, we've been fooled.

111
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,890
Guys, back to the police station.

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,120
Yes, sir.

113
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,360
The files were made
by the police station.

114
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,650
(Jiangzhou Prison Stationery)
Why would they use prison stationery?

115
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,980
This is not Ding Mao's original file.

116
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,760
Oh no, how could I make

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,690
such a silly mistake?

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,620
Don't run. I'm injured.

119
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,400
- Xiaofan.
- I just saw Xu Shenxing.

120
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,670
He seemed a bit off.

121
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,310
- Xu Shenxing?
- Ten minutes ago,

122
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,550
he went to the director's office.

123
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,400
Oh no, Ding Mao's next target

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,250
is Director Xu.

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,420
He induced Xu Shenxing

126
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,980
to kill Director Xu.

127
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,250
Right in the police station.

128
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,450
Not again?

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,360
Why is Cheng Tianlang here?

130
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,430
When we control Xu Shenxing,

131
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,270
I'll tell you.

132
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,010
Wait for me!

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Ouch, ouch.

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,200
Qin Huole,

135
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,450
we finally meet.

136
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,370
Ding Mao, I already know

137
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,740
you are working for Night God.

138
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,010
Xiaofan, you guys save Director Xu first,

139
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,130
or it will be too late.

140
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,390
Go.

141
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,630
Go now.

142
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,980
Why aren't you leaving yet?

143
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,370
If I could leave, I would have left
already.

144
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,710
Leave this to me.

145
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,830
You guys go quickly.

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Go!

147
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,150
Go.

148
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,390
Ding Mao, right?

149
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Originally, today's matter

150
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,060
has nothing to do with me.

151
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,100
I don't want to be a hero either.

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,620
But if he gets hurt,

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,660
my bounty will be gone.

154
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,130
Today, you run into me.

155
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,100
It's your bad luck.

156
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,040
Huole, hurry up.

157
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,300
(Detention Room)
It's too late.

158
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,680
Youlan.

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,230
The murderer who killed Master Long
is outside.

160
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,130
I need your help.

161
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,590
Shenxing,

162
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,470
what are you doing?

163
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,170
I want to kill you

164
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,700
to avenge Huanyang.

165
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,650
You want to kill me?

166
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm your father. You want to kill me?

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,640
It was you.

168
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,250
You killed Huanyang.

169
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,470
Miss.

170
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,920
Miss.

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,100

174
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,200
Xu Shenxing,

175
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,980
do you know what you are doing?

176
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,820
I don't know what I'm doing.

177
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,720
I only know that there is

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,370
one bullet left in my gun.

179
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,650
Go check on Director Xu.

180
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,940
It is bad.

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,650
Go to my office
and bring the medical kit.

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,820
It's on the left side as you enter.

183
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,830
Okay.

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,230
Xiaofan.

185
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,070
Tie Xu Shenxing up.

186
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,950
Don't worry.

(Detention Room)

191
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,400
Cheng Tianlang.

192
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
Cheng Tianlang.

193
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,830
Are you okay?

194
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,440
You need to leave quickly.

195
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,940
If you die,

196
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,290
the bounty will be gone.

197
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,010
All my efforts will be in vain.

198
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,110
I'll be back.

199
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
Qin Huole.

200
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,700
You can't escape.

201
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,250
Do you think

202
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,410
you can kill me?

203
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,270
- Are you okay, Huole?
- Hurry.

204
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,340
Director Xu's office.

205
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,870
Okay.

206
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,750
- Youlan.
- Where is the murderer?

207
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,320
Listen to me first. Go hide
in the Autopsy Room.

208
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,820
I'll find a way to bring the murderer
over.

209
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,070
Go quickly.

210
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,940
(Autopsy Room)

211
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Get up.

212
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,860
Thank you for saving my life, heroine.

213
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,990
Now,

214
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,770
can you please get up?

215
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,720
How are you? Are you badly hurt?

216
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,100
Should I ask Xiaofan to take a look
at you?

217
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,990
Heroine,

218
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
I have a question for you.

219
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
What kind of medicine

220
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,240
was in that syringe?

221
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
How did one shot

222
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,290
knock Ding Mao down?

223
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,640
How would I know?

224
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Alright.

225
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
I'll take you back first.

226
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,270
I'll interrogate him later.

227
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,620
- Back where?
- To the Detention Room.

228
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Well.

229
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,080
Ding Mao has been caught,

230
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,370
but the case hasn't been solved yet.

231
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,770
So I can't set you free yet.

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,620
You burn the bridge after crossing
the river.

233
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,370
After the case is closed, I'll treat you
to coffee.

234
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,770
Remember what you said.
