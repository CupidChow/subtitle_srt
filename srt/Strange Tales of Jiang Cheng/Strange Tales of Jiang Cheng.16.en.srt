=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 16=

2
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
Thank you.

3
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,880
Thank you.

4
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,100
You came all this way
just to have a cup of tea?

5
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,470
What's going on? Hurry up and tell us.

6
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,510
Stop keeping us in suspense.

7
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,330
Let's go to Xiyin Temple first.

8
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,050
Maybe when the sun rises,

9
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,180
everything

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,850
will come to the truth.

11
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,900
(Xiyin Temple)

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,340
The third target is a traveling doctor.

13
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,380
He was hidden under the pit
where Han Da was trapped.

14
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,060
We were too late.

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,730
You've done your best.

16
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,130
That no grievances in the world

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,410
is just an ideal.

18
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,270
Sir,

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,540
I have told you

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,620
everything I know.

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,960
All things

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,900
arise from some reasons and disperse
when those reasons don't exist.

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,660
Why must you do this?

24
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,850
Isn't there another way?

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,540
They were lives.

26
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,500
To him,

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,620
(Monk Chenhai in Xiyin Temple)
it's just

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,250
the beginning of eternal life.

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,900
Miss, don't be afraid.

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Come, sit.

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Everyone,

32
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,250
it's time to reveal the murderer.

33
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,970
Mr. Qin,

34
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,220
who is the murderer?

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,620
Before identifying the murderer,

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,120
I would like to introduce

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,570
the three victims first.

38
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
The first victim

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,170
was named Che Jingwen.

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,220
He was a Chinese teacher
at Sicun Middle School

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,170
and also Xiaofan's mentor.

42
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,820
According to Xiaofan's autopsy,

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,290
the time of his death

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,570
was around 11 p.m. on April 18th.

45
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,140
The cause of death was drowning.

46
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,660
The second victim

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,320
was the owner of Wuyuxuan Teahouse,

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,340
Han Da.

49
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,700
The time of his death

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,660
was 10 p.m. on April 19th.

51
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,930
He died in an explosion.

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,460
The third victim

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,410
was a traveling doctor in Jiangzhou,

54
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,810
named Xu San'er.

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,140
The time of his death was 6 p.m. on April 20th.

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
The cause of death was inhaling

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,900
a large amount of oleander pollen.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,850
These three people
had no connection at all.

59
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,850
How did they
all become the murderer's targets?

60
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,310
Che Jingwen

61
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,680
was a person with a peculiar personality

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,730
according to his colleagues.

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,310
He had no friends

64
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,670
because he constructed his mental world

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,900
to be extremely complex.

66
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,700
What he sought

67
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,100
were people who resonated with his soul.

68
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,190
Therefore,

69
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,070
ordinary people

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,140
could not communicate with him at all.

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,220
Yes.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
I remember

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,540
when I first met Mr. Che,

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,700
he had already been world-weary.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,260
I wanted to alleviate his pessimism,

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,360
but

77
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,580
he was too erudite.

78
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,970
In a debate,

79
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,560
I was rendered speechless

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,660
by him.

81
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,930
However, after that incident,

82
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,990
Mr. Che

83
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,410
would often

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,030
come to Xiyin Temple

85
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,540
to have long chats with me.

86
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,700
But still, I was one move short

87
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,610
and couldn't prevent this tragedy.

88
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,230
Master, you shouldn't blame yourself
too much.

89
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,290
Buddhist teachings say
that life is impermanent.

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,540
So why

91
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,660
did Che Jingwen get killed?

92
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,900
Because of the other two victims in this case,

93
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,580
Han Da and Xu San'er.

94
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,260
Han's wife told me

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,410
that before the incident,
Han Da had met with Xu San'er.

96
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,220
The two seemed
to be discussing something.

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,750
What could Han Da and a traveling doctor

98
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,710
discuss?

99
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,260
Maybe he had some secret illness?

100
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,610
Han Da and his wife
had always wanted a child,

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,340
- but...
- So

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,260
the victim Han Da

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,640
had tried all methods,

104
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,100
but none were effective.

105
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,370
He then sought
the traveling doctor Xu San'er.

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,970
That's right.
At his most desperate moment,

107
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
it was Xu San'er

108
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,340
who gave him hope.

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
Han's wife told me

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,460
that Han Da was nearly driven mad

111
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,020
by the desire to have a child.

112
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,720
Let me tell you,

113
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
we will soon

114
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,170
have our own child.

115
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Really?

116
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,800
Really.

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,060
Doctor Xu said,

118
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
(Han Da, owner of Wuyuxuan Teahouse)
since ancient times,

119
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,270
emperors have had the tradition
of making medicine from humans

120
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,340
to ensure the continuity
of their descendants.

121
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,590
Now this prescription

122
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,540
is in Doctor Xu's hands.

123
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,670
It is much stronger

124
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,260
than other secret prescriptions.

125
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280
As long as

126
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,680
I can find

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,700
a disabled woman to make the medicine.

128
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
No.

129
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,270
Our tea garden happens
to have a mute girl.

130
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,410
Just once, honey.

131
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Just once

132
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,970
and you will have your own child.

133
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,110
But...

134
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,730
No buts.

135
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,260
Don't worry.

136
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,220
She is just a mute.

137
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,260
Pervert.

138
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,430
Don't be afraid.

139
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,730
They can't hurt you anymore.

140
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,750
It seems

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,850
the murderer was avenging the mute girl.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
That's why he killed him.

143
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,610
But

144
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,780
what does Jingwen have to do

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,050
with this?

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,150
The murderer killed him

147
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,730
because if he didn't die

148
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,100
the rest of the plan couldn't proceed.

149
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,410
The rest of the plan?

150
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
Yes.

151
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,800
The killing was just the first step

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,230
in the murderer's entire plan.

153
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,970
Killing was not his ultimate goal.

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,490
It's just the beginning.

155
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,140
You could say that.

156
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,750
Mr. Huo.

157
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,190
You are
the most famous detective novelist

158
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,100
in Jiangcheng.

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,490
Your novels are well-known.

160
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,190
That's why the murderer followed the plot

161
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,030
of the corpse in the lake

162
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,730
from The Death Lantern

163
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,970
to drown Che Jingwen in Yuan Lake.

164
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,830
Before killing Han Da

165
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,970
and Xu San'er,

166
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,850
he prepared murder notices.

167
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,580
But in fact,

168
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,640
he never intended to let Xu San'er

169
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,540
and Han Da live.

170
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,710
The reason he did this

171
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,560
was to guide us

172
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,470
to uncover the truth

173
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,540
and to expose their evil deeds

174
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,460
to the greatest extent.

175
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,100
And the beginning of the plan

176
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,620
revolved around Mr. Huo.

177
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,790
Me?

178
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,910
Yes.

179
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,600
The murderer not only knew your novel

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,450
so well,

181
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,020
but also understood your personality
thoroughly.

182
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,620
However, he...

183
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,140
I mean the murderer.

184
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,140
What is his motive?

185
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,620
It's your reader.

186
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,670
She once asked me,

187
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,880
is there a detective like Cheng Sen

188
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,780
in this world?

189
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,210
May I ask you a question?

190
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,500
Mr. Huo, if the case is closed

191
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,810
and the murderer is brought to justice,

192
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,140
how would you describe Xiaofan,

193
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,570
Captain Song and me

194
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,780
in your novel?

195
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,380
It would certainly be like Cheng Sen.

196
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,930
This is what the murderer wanted.

197
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,050
This is also the reason

198
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,810
why the murderer left a note

199
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,480
on Xu San'er

200
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,600
that the answer is not in any novels.

201
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,860
Because he knew the mute girl

202
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,540
was your loyal reader.

203
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,070
He also knew the mute girl

204
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,140
longed for the world

205
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,640
to have a detective like Cheng Sen,

206
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,480
who could stand up

207
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,840
and seek justice for her,

208
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,740
and who could protect her.

209
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,140
So, when the novels became reality,

210
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,810
he also chose a path to live on

211
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,810
for the mute girl.

212
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,520
You've talked for so long.

213
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,620
Who exactly is the murderer?

214
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
The murderer

215
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,090
is Che Jingwen.

216
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,020
(Mahavira Hall)

217
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,190
I still cannot agree

218
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,500
with you, sir.

219
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,930
People practice Buddhism
and worship Buddha

220
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,050
for liberation

221
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,810
to reach the other shore,

222
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,600
not for the real meaning

223
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,450
of that people and the world
are not worth lingering.

224
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,780
Do people practice Buddhism
and worship Buddha

225
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,570
really for liberation?

226
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,090
This is nothing but ritualistic worship

227
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,240
and wishful thinking

228
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,140
for disaster relief and blessing.

229
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,540
Master, in the temple,

230
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,240
you meet so many

231
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,090
so-called devout people every day.

232
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,860
You should know this well, right?

233
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,910
Sir,

234
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,410
you are too sharp.

235
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,380
People always need to hear the wind

236
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,740
before they can notice the sound
of the trees,

237
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,500
and finally

238
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,240
perceive the voice of the heart.

239
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,210
Those who understand me

240
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,450
know my sorrow.

241
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,860
Those who do not understand me

242
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,660
wonder what I seek.

243
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,260
It seems

244
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,140
even if we debate

245
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,980
for hundreds of days,

246
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,380
I still cannot make you stay, sir.

247
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,660
People do not understand me.

248
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,170
Neither do I understand people.

249
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,450
Master Chenhai told me,

250
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,260
after that small conversation,

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,410
he saw Mr. Che's death wishes

252
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,780
through his shadow.

253
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,980
But the unexpected appearance

254
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,780
of the mute girl

255
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,290
saved him from the brink of death.

256
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,540
Live on.

257
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,390
Thank you.

258
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
(The Death Lantern)

259
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,900
This is the book you read?

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,060
(Blood Stain on White Clothes)

261
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,140
(Cheng Sen)

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,980
You like Cheng Sen?

263
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,260
(Zhushan Yipin)

264
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,410
(Sir, this is the first jar
of new tea this year.)

265
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,690
(A sip will make you taste
the sunshine, rain, and wind.)

266
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,980
(One can only live once. For the sake
of such a beautiful day, please stay.)

267
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
Thank you.

268
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,380
The mute girl was innocent and lively,

269
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,500
and evoked affection.

270
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,690
She made Mr. Che

271
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,920
feel the beauty and kindness

272
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,740
of the world once again.

273
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,570
However, such days

274
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,330
did not last long,

275
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,450
and they were completely destroyed.

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,840
What's wrong?

277
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,690
For someone like Mr. Che,

278
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,620
once he made up his mind,

279
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,500
it's hard to change it.

280
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,390
Thus,

281
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,620
he began his plan.

282
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,060
