2
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,910
Sir.

3
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,130
I beg you.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,890
Let me out, please.

5
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,250
I miss my mother.

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,490
Alright.

7
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,890
I will take you out.

8
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,550
Wu Bing.

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,020
What are you doing?

10
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,180
Sir.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,720
Wu Jia.

12
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,030
Wu Yi.

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,170
I...

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,620
I want to let her go.

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,640
Brother.

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,030
Do you still remember

17
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,060
how our parents died?

18
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,130
Fellow citizens,

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,520
today is

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,780
a very important day.

21
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,310
Bandits

22
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,340
Zhen Jianglong and Zhan Ruhua

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,130
- have been arrested.
- Good.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,940
Well done.

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,640
Thanks to the two citizens

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,940
for assisting the police.

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,620
Now let's invite Mr. He

28
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,980
to present awards to the two citizens.

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,740
Good.

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,740
Nice.

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,180
Yes.

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,500
Good job.

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,580
- Applaud for them.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,420
Good.

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,740
Noon has arrived.
Identity has been confirmed.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,100
Shoot.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,180
Wu Bing.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,700
How are you? Are you alright?

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,340
Come here.

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,460
Have a seat.

41
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,020
Come here.

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,460
Bother.

43
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,420
You know

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,580
Wu Bing's character.

45
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,060
Don't be angry.

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,460
Wu Bing, come here.

47
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,540
Stand up.

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,460
Don't make our brother angry.

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,220
We must remember,

50
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,820
no matter what happens,

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,660
the three of us are kin brothers.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,540
Kid.

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,700
Kid, wake up.

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
Wake up.

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,860
Wu Yi, what should we do?

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,220
Anyway, the deadline we agreed
with the police

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,100
is approaching.

58
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,740
If they can't find us,

59
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,860
this girl will die anyway.

60
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,220
Wu Bing.

61
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,860
You've become such a coward.

62
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,140
Wu Yi.

63
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,500
Do you think he's

64
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,980
really our brother?

65
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,620
Brother, after all,
Wu Bing has stayed in Green Bay

66
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,100
with that fisherman for seven years.

67
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,100
It's inevitable

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,300
that deep down he would be a bit soft.

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,300
No way.

70
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300
Since he is a member of the Wu Family,

71
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,900
he must regain his courage.

72
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,380
Come on.

73
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,460
Stab her.

74
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Sir.

75
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,220
You are a good man.

76
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,900
Please let me go.

77
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,580
Brother.

78
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,180
- Brother.
- Stab her to death.

79
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
How dare you touch me?

80
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,780
No.

81
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,620
Brother, I didn't mean to.

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,660
How dare you strike your brother?

83
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,260
No, Brother, I didn't mean to.

84
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,100
Brother.

85
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,780
Brother, I'm begging you.

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,420
Can you let this kid go?

87
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,620
Brother, I'm begging you.

88
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,260
Let her go.

89
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,860
But she's the enemy's child.

90
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
No.

91
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,260
Haven't we already avenged our parents?

92
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,260
This kid is innocent.

93
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
Let's stop hurting people.

94
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,140
I must kill her today.

95
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,980
Let's see how you protect

96
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,940
this little girl.

97
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,540
Brother, I'm begging you.

98
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,740
Brother.

99
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,780
That's enough.

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,940
Move aside.

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,500
Wu Yi.

102
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,780
I'll fight it out with you.

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,940
It seems like Temple of Guan Yu
is on fire.

104
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,420
Sir.

105
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
Don't worry. I will take you out.

106
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,340
Sir...

107
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,820
(Temple of Guan Yu)

108
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,180
(Temple of Guan Yu)

109
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,380
Captain, the temple is on fire.
What should we do?

110
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,780
I just saw a fire brigade

111
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,860
on the way here.

112
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,820
I can drive. I'll go.

113
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,660
Alright.

114
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,540
There's a hidden door here.

115
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Are you crazy?
You'll die if you go down like this.

116
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,940
What other choice do we have?

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,100
- Water.
- I have some here.

118
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,420
Pour it on this.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,180
I'll go down first.

120
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,500
Mao, Huole, you stay at the entrance.

121
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,340
Chen Zheng, wait outside
for the fire brigade.

122
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,180
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Help!

124
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Help!

125
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Help!

126
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,660
Where's the kid?

127
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,500
Hurry. She is still inside.

128
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,340
Save her first.

129
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,780
It's going to collapse. Let's go.

130
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,780
- Let's go.
- Go!

131
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,740
Let's go!

132
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,260
Captain.

133
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,740
The kid.

134
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm afraid...

135
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,340
I'm begging you.

136
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,300
Please save her.

137
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm begging you.

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Go save that kid.

139
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,860
I'm begging you.

140
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,780
Captain, don't.

141
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,860
- Don't.
- I'm begging you.

142
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,140
Go save that kid.

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,420
She's right inside.

144
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,390
Don't.

145
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm begging you.

146
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,380
- Go save her.
- Take him away.

147
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,220
- Go.
- Go.

148
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,020
(Interrogation Room)

149
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,860
Song He.

150
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,260
Song He.

151
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,580
- Song He.
- Let me go.

152
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,620
Wu Bing has already been arrested.

153
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,300
- You don't need to...
- The child is gone.

154
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,540
If I act as if nothing happened,

155
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,580
would I still be human?

156
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,180
Is there still hope for that kid?

157
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,300
It's all my fault.

158
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,780
I was too clumsy.

159
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,700
I couldn't save the kid

160
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,940
from them.

161
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,060
If I had arrived a bit earlier,

162
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,060
maybe the kid could have been saved.

163
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,380
What did you say?

164
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Arrived a bit earlier?

165
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,820
What do you mean?

166
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,740
Sir,

167
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,300
I don't understand why you arrested me.

168
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,300
Wu Bing!

169
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,460
Wu Bing?

170
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Who is Wu Bing?

171
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,140
No, no. Sir,

172
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,200
did you arrest the wrong person?

173
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm just a passerby.

174
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,340
I saw the Temple of Guan Yu on fire.

175
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,980
Someone was calling for help, and then I...

176
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,880
Who knew that good intentions
would not be rewarded?

177
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
Sir,

178
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,820
I never admitted

179
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,020
that my name is Wu Bing.

180
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,700
You never asked me either.

181
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,220
Moreover,

182
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
what evidence do you have?

183
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,860
You must be wondering

184
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,060
why I went to save her.

185
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,620
Because

186
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,380
I am a kind person naturally.

187
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,140
Not being able to save that kid

188
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,220
breaks my heart.

189
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
Detective Song,

190
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,980
do you want to hit me now?

191
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,540
Go ahead.

192
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,740
Hit me here.

193
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,180
You are a policeman.

194
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,860
That kid is dead.

195
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,980
Temple of Guan Yu has been
burned down to ashes.

196
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,540
Even the old fisherman who took care of
Wu Bing for seven years

197
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,140
is probably

198
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,380
terribly ill now.

199
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,460
Even if I were Wu Bing,

200
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,180
without evidence,

201
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,540
you would still have to release me.

202
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,700
Right?

203
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,180
Besides, I really am not him.

204
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,140
Get out.

205
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
When you get out,

206
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,940
will you still engage in kidnapping?

207
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,740
If I were Wu Bing,

208
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,860
I think I would.

209
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,780
Goodbye, officers.

210
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,180
Wu Yi.

211
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,260
What did you just call me?

212
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,900
Stop pretending.

213
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,180
You killed your brother Wu Bing

214
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,060
and took over his body.

215
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,740
Brother.

216
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,780
Brother.

217
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,700
Brother.

218
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,020
Brother.

219
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,140
Wu Bing.

220
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
Wu Yi.

221
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,700
My head hurts.

222
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,140
Help me.

223
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,140
Wu Bing.

224
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,660
Maybe the police have arrived.

225
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,940
Among the three of us,

226
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,500
Wu Jia is too irritable

227
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,220
and you are too weak.

228
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,060
Whoever falls into their hands

229
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,060
won't be able to handle it.

230
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,700
Leave the rest

231
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,060
to me.

232
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm

233
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,940
sorry.

234
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm sorry.
