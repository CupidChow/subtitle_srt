2
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,380
(Huo Residence)

3
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Goodbye,

4
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,030
Detectives.

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,240
Bye.

6
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,220
(The Death Lantern)

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,080
What do you think?

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,300
This Huo Qingxin is quite skilled
in socializing.

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,190
No wonder he became famous

10
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,530
after just two years of writing novels.

11
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,770
You mean

12
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,680
his novels aren't that good?

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
No.

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,590
They're quite good.

15
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,920
As good as the novels
I've read abroad.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,540
Did you find anything from him?

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,890
From a psychological perspective,

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,890
I didn't find anything unusual.

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,110
Maybe the publishing house

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,300
is trying to sell more books

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,490
by hiring the murderer.

22
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,570
Your idea is too crazy.

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,270
Is it?

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,520
Captain Song.

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,220
It's good you haven't gone far.

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,340
(To Huo Qingxin.
From Che Jingwen.)

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,340
Che Jingwen.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,250
What is this?

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,730
I received it this morning.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,400
I forgot to give it to you earlier.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,290
I don't know
if it will help with the case or not.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Mr. Huo.

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,710
If you find anything else,

34
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,870
remember to notify me immediately.

35
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,030
Rest assured, Captain Song.

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,380
I always abide by the law.

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,520
If I think of anything,
I will immediately

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,290
report to the detective squad.

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,110
- Thank you.
- You two take care.

40
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,950
See you.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,900
Why is it a blank sheet of paper?

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,380
(To Qin Huole)

43
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,480
Let's go to the bookstore first.

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,100
No, let's go back to the station first.

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,270
What is this?

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,220
So it wasn't from you.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,290
Why would I send you a gift?

48
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,400
In Jiangzhou, besides you and Xiaofan,

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,540
I don't have many friends.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,820
This morning, I received a pen.

51
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,780
Now there's a letter with no content.

52
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,500
Do you think there could be

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,900
some connection between them?

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,280
Maybe Mr. Che knew

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,270
he might die.

56
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,820
So he left us the clue

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,380
to the murderer.

58
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,500
If that's the case,

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,780
why didn't he just tell us
who the murderer is,

60
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,990
or

61
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,130
seek our help

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,450
before it happened?

63
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,780
That's right.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,760
What do these things mean?

65
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,850
Is it just a coincidence?

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
No.

67
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,940
I have a feeling.

68
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,870
These two things

69
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,130
must be related to his death.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,220
We need to solve this mystery.

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,280
What's that smell?

72
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,270
It's the same as the smell on the letter.

73
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,140
It's birch sap.

74
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,640
Is there an oil lamp?

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,480
I'll go find one.

76
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,550
Wait.

77
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,930
- Will this work?
- Yes.

78
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,760
The second target

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,140
will die at 8 p.m. on April 19th.

80
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,730
I can't wake up that parrot.

81
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,610
Reading The Death Lantern
won't help either.

82
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,220
This wasn't from Che Jingwen.

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
It was from the murderer,

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,200
who used Che Jingwen

85
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,220
to leave us a clue.

86
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,580
He wants to play a game with me.

87
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,020
Next, he will kill again.

88
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,560
The second target

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,580
will die at 8 p.m. on April 19th.

90
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,900
Isn't that tonight?

91
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,960
It's six hours later.

92
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,760
Hurry, we must find him.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,730
Do you know where he is?

94
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,460
He has already given us a hint.

95
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,760
8 p.m. on April 19th

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
is the time.

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,020
The location is also hidden in it.

98
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,460
The Death Lantern

99
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,200
(The Death Lantern).
may be some kind of a hint.

100
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,060
And the location

101
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,100
(Parrot).

102
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,970
is related to the word "parrot".

103
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,500
(Parrot).

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,490
Guys, put down what you're doing.

105
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,120
Read all the Jiangzhou chronicles,

106
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Jiangzhou place names,

107
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,050
and landscape records.

108
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,000
Find out the place names

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,080
with the word "parrot".

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't miss a single one.

111
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,900
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Captain,

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,810
guess what?

114
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,170
Qin Huole is right again.

115
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,560
Let me tell you.

116
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,580
Once that Tailor Wang

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,040
earned a bit of money,

118
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,460
he started to despise his wife.

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,160
Not only did he has a lover outside,

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,830
but he also insisted

121
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,200
on living happily together with her.

122
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,930
So he had the thought of
killing his wife.

123
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,440
I just scared him a little

124
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,460
and he confessed everything.

125
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,200
Detective Qin

126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,220
is truly remarkable.

127
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,260
With a few details of the case,

128
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,370
he figured out the truth.

129
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,520
Captain, if we have Detective Qin,

130
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,930
will there be any case we can't solve?

131
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,720
Captain,

132
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,850
what are you looking for?

133
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,760
Is there anything I can help with?

134
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,030
Go to Sicun Middle School

135
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,590
and investigate Che Jingwen's background.

136
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,030
The more detailed, the better.

137
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,870
Yes.

138
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,920
Run there.

139
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,110
Hurry up!

140
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,430
What are you looking at?

141
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,430
Did you find it?

142
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,360
Xiaofan.

143
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,210
I know,

144
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,790
you want to catch the murderer

145
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,020
more than anyone else.

146
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,920
I just want to do something

147
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,050
for Mr. Che.

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,730
But at times like this,

149
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,260
we can't be impatient.

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,170
Because bad emotions

151
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,900
will lead to wrong memories.

152
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,370
I need your help.

153
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,480
Now,

154
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,930
you need to recall

155
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,310
all the details

156
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,350
of your meeting with Mr. Che three days ago.

157
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,020
The clearer you remember,

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,930
the closer we can get to the truth.

159
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,720
Come on.

160
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll do it with you.

161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Close your eyes,

162
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,970
and take a deep breath.

163
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,490
Take your time.

164
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,340
Think about

165
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,780
Mr. Che's house

166
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,140
you saw three days ago.

167
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,520
(Erudition and Determination)
Such precious tea

168
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,850
should not be wasted.

169
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,110
Stop.

170
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
What's wrong?

171
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,930
What did the tea taste like?

172
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
The taste of the tea?

173
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Yes.

174
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,840
Nothing special.

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,140
It's just an ordinary tea.

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,360
Oh, when I was leaving,

177
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,740
Mr. Che gave me the tea leaves.

178
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
Where is it?

179
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,940
(Zhushan Yipin)

180
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,950
Is there something wrong with the tea?

181
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,790
It smells quite good.

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,950
Mr. Che gave it to you.

183
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,140
Why don't we brew a cup and try it?

184
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,090
(Blood Stain on White Clothes)
This is not for kids.

185
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,540
(Xuanyuan Living Corpse)

186
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,630
Is this book

187
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,210
also written by Huo Qingxin?

188
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,140
You mean Xuanyuan Living Corpse?

189
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,540
This is Huo Qingxin's second book.

190
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,810
It's considered a sequel
to The Death Lantern.

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,240
A sequel?

192
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,640
Is the protagonist still Cheng Sen?

193
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,480
Yes.

194
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,540
(Forensic Room)

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
Where is Huole?

196
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,050
He said he went out for a walk.

197
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,910
Take a look at this.

198
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,030
I just asked the book rental owner

199
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,670
(Xuanyuan Living Corpse)
to tell me some stories

200
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,570
about The Death Lantern.

201
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,870
I found out

202
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,760
that apart from the corpse in the lake

203
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,120
which resembles Che Jingwen's death,

204
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,090
there is nothing suspicious.

205
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,390
So I thought,

206
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,000
since he killed Che Jingwen

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,070
in a way

208
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,120
from The Death Lantern,

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,760
could his next method of killing

210
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,920
appear in the sequel

211
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
to The Death Lantern,

212
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,380
Xuanyuan Living Corpse?

213
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
You're right.

214
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,900
Just like the letter said,

215
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,160
reading The Death Lantern

216
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,260
couldn't wake up that parrot.

217
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,760
Maybe this Xuanyuan Living Corpse

218
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
can do it.

219
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,560
I'll read this book.

220
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,070
I don't have it here either.

221
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,910
Yes.

222
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,360
How did it go, guys?

223
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,950
- Did you find anything?
- No, captain.

224
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,950
- Sorry, captain.
- No.

225
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,260
- No. - Keep looking.

226
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,540
Captain, I found a place.

227
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,540
This place is called Parrot Ridge.

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Does that count?

229
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,440
But now this place

230
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,980
is no longer under Jiangzhou's jurisdiction.

231
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,340
It was ceded to Ningcheng 300 years ago.

232
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,500
The jurisdiction of Parrot Ridge
is taken over by Ningcheng.

233
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,110
How far is it?

234
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,190
South of the Su River,

235
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,050
and north of Mang Mountain.

236
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,300
The place is rarely visited by people.

237
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,150
- The caves are pitch dark.
- Alright, no need to read further.

238
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,600
Su River.

239
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
Why?

240
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,860
Su River is hundreds of miles away
from Jiangzhou.

241
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,030
If you were the murderer,

242
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,410
would you take your target that far?

243
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,090
Wouldn't you consider the uncertainties?

244
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,810
Captain, what should we do now?

245
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,260
There must be something missing.

246
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
Let me think.

247
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,380
Cheng Sen felt a sudden jolt.

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,570
This Parrot Tomb has been eerie.

249
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,170
It's rumored
that flying zombies often appear.

250
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,170
He can't be so unfortunate today

251
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,780
to run into one, can he?

252
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,190
Parrot Tomb.

253
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,660
The parrot can't be awakened,

254
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,330
because

255
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,880
the parrot is already dead!

256
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
What's wrong?

257
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,090
Why are you looking for Huo Qingxin?

258
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,640
What did you find in the book?

259
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,330
There's no time.
I'll explain on the way.

260
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,210
You mean

261
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,550
Che Jingwen

262
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,860
is just the murderer's first victim?

263
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,670
He's still continuing his crimes,

264
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,860
and has even announced
the time and place of the next murder?

265
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,240
The clue is hidden

266
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,570
in Xuanyuan Living Corpse?

267
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,450
If our guess is correct,

268
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,560
it's highly likely.

269
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,690
Are you sure

270
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,070
the person the murderer wants to kill

271
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,410
is hidden in Parrot Tomb?

272
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,840
Who is the police officer,

273
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,140
you or Captain Song?

274
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,270
Dr. Fan,

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,070
Miss Fan,

276
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,210
I'm just too curious.

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,650
Why would the murderer

278
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,920
insist on imitating the scenes

279
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,780
from my novels?

280
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,780
Time is pressing.

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
Just tell us,

282
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,540
is there a place called Parrot Tomb
in Jiangzhou?

283
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes,

284
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,900
of course there is.

285
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,140
Stop keeping us in suspense.

286
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,330
Panlong Hill in the northern suburbs.

287
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,070
That's where the story

288
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,620
of Parrot Tomb is from.

289
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,410
Who else knows about this?

290
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,270
A few friends in my literary circle

291
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,110
know about it.

292
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,810
They are...

293
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,050
Well, I can't recall

294
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,440
every one of them

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,620
right now.

296
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,210
Please take some time to think about it.

297
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,330
We will come again.

298
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,790
Alright.

299
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,260
Hello, connect me to
Jiangzhou Publishing House immediately.

300
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,170
Zhang, let me tell you.

301
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,520
Destroy

302
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
all the stock

303
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,980
of Xuanyuan Living Corpse quickly.

304
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,360
I don't care how you do it.

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,240
Even if you use it as toilet paper,

306
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,810
I don't care.

307
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,880
In short, by tomorrow,

308
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,210
there should be no books left to sell.

309
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,270
Yes, of course.

310
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,950
We will print a collector's edition.

311
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,210
Otherwise, how will we make money?

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,140
Alright, alright.

313
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,900
I already have plans for the new book,

314
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,520
so you don't need to worry about it.

315
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,760
Just make sure to handle

316
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
what I told you to do.

317
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,690
We are going to make a fortune.

318
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,780
(Wuyuxuan Teahouse)
Wait a moment!

319
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,260
Sorry to keep you from closing up.

320
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,380
I would like to buy 100 grams
of Shilixiang new tea.

321
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,740
Detective Qin.

322
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,820
Mao.

323
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,810
Is this tea a new clue?

324
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,570
It's not a new clue.

325
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Recently, I think the local Shilixiang

326
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,620
tastes better than coffee.

327
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,500
Let me guess.

328
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,410
Captain Song sent you
to Sicun Middle School, right?

329
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,310
Detective Qin,

330
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,520
you are really amazing.

331
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,740
Nothing can be hidden from you.

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,840
Tell me.

333
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,430
I talked

334
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,790
to the principal and the teachers.

335
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,480
They all said
they didn't know Che Jingwen well.

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
They said he was usually aloof

337
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,990
and rarely interacted with his colleagues.

338
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,720
So, regarding his personal life,

339
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,880
they don't know much about it either.

340
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,840
As for the people

341
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,790
he had conflicts with,

342
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,410
that's even harder to know.

343
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,860
What about his students?

344
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,330
His students

345
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,900
actually quite like him.

346
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,540
When they heard he was murdered,

347
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,170
they all cried their eyes out.

348
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,430
Alright, let's go.

349
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,910
Detective Qin.

350
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,510
Where is Captain Song?

351
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,480
Captain Song just went out

352
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,320
with Dr. Fan.

353
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,690
They left a note for you.

354
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,930
The clue is in the Parrot Tomb chapter
of Xuanyuan Living Corpse.

355
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,690
We went to find Huo Qingxin.

356
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
This is bad!

357
