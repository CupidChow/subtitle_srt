=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 28=

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,080
Don't worry.

3
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,300
I won't let you suffer any loss.

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,590
No matter how much

5
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,410
you have paid for this eagle,

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,540
I'll give you

7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,300
the exact amount.

8
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,890
That's very kind of you.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,250
You know

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,770
all my money is tied up
in this batch of goods.

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,940
I don't have a single penny
left in my pocket.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,050
All I have left is this house.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,020
Mr. Zhuang,

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,850
when you get out of this plight,

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,970
I'll return it to you.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,720
Thank you.

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,190
It...

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,950
Mr. Zhuang.

19
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,470
What's wrong?

20
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,690
It is smart.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,380
Someone must have broken in.

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,460
Mr. Zheng, stay here.

23
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,290
- I'll go check it out.
- Okay.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,830
Someone!

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,820
Two thieves have broken in.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,920
Find them.

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,060
Don't let them escape.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,010
You go out from the back door.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
I'll hold them off for you.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,780
Didn't I just say?

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,970
Police don't abandon their comrades.

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,590
Take them down for me.

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,430
- Yes.
- Wait.

35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,150
I want to see

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,310
who dares to break

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,780
into my house.

38
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,320
Mr. Zhuang,

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,900
isn't this a bit too much?

40
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,410
They're definitely not thieves.

41
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,250
They're clearly water bandits.

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,920
Not only do they rob,

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,290
but they also want to take lives.

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,390
Come on.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,970
Kill them without mercy.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Go.

47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,900
Go after them!

48
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,150
Captain Song,

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,100
there's a barn ahead.
It's hard to escape.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,200
Go this way.

51
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,110
The symptoms

52
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,540
of this disease are very clear.

53
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,660
Often, it can be noticed.

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,250
Xu Shenxing is a celebrity in Jiangzhou.

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,800
How could no one have noticed

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,780
or mentioned it?

57
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,290
It seems even Director Xu
didn't know about it.

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,800
What are the symptoms of this disease?

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,690
Weakness of the heart,

60
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,870
frailty and emaciation,

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,040
coughing,

62
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,970
and in severe cases, coughing up blood.

63
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,150
Coughing up blood?

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,220
The victim should not
be Xu Shenxing at all,

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,600
but rather

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,900
Shen Yuan.

67
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,130
Only those who have used a brush pen
for a long time

68
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,170
would have such calluses
on their index fingers.

69
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,690
So the murderer peeled off
the victim's facial skin

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,970
and left that doll behind

71
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
to divert our investigation

72
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,940
to Huanyang's badger enchantment.

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,320
His purpose

74
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,340
was to distract the investigators

75
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,020
and conceal the victim's identity.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,540
I was too careless.

77
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,050
How could I so carelessly

78
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,370
assume the victim was Xu Shenxing?

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,020
It was wrong from the start.

80
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,880
How could we find the truth?

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,730
Though we took a detour,

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,780
it also means we are getting closer
to the truth.

83
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,810
Let's go to Huanyinglou.

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,610
Luckily, we ran fast.

85
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,780
Otherwise, we would have been caught.

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
Bro,

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,100
I owe you a favor.

88
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,190
If it weren't for you,

89
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,660
we wouldn't have gotten out at all.

90
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
But

91
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,930
how did you know

92
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,780
there's a barn

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,730
behind the moon gate?

94
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,850
If I said I guessed,

95
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,780
would you believe me?

96
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,100
Of course, I would.

97
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,460
Just like if you said

98
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,540
you never misled our investigation,

99
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,660
I would believe that too.

100
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,660
Captain Song,

101
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,170
when did you start suspecting me?

102
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,410
I've never trusted you.

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,900
Gu Sui is quite interesting.

104
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,900
His skills are indeed impressive.

105
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,170
He arrived just in time

106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,900
and has exceptional memory
and a sense of justice.

107
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,660
Why do I feel like you don't like him?

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,810
Is it because his skills
are better than yours?

109
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,610
I just think

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
if any people and things

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
are too coincidental,

112
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
they are all worth suspecting.

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,030
Now you are also starting

114
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,140
to read minds.

115
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,900
Since you dared to stay with us,

116
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,930
it means you've made thorough plans.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
If I acted rashly,

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,460
it would alert you.

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
It's better

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,970
to wait for you to show a flaw first.

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,610
If I guess it right,

122
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,350
at the entrance
of Youlong Gambling House,

123
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,660
it was you who shot the killer,

124
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,870
right?

125
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,370
I want to know your motive.

126
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,660
Why Xu Shenxing?

127
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,050
Defeat me and I'll tell you.

128
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,050
(Detention Room)

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,340
We know everything.

130
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,490
The victim is not Xu Shenxing.

131
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,850
It is a scribe named Shen Yuan.

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,290
Why did you kill Shen Yuan

133
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,520
and dress him like Xu Shenxing?

134
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
And,

135
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,780
where is Xu Shenxing?

136
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,460
Where is the singing girl Huanyang?

137
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,070
Speak!

138
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,260
Kill me as you wish.

139
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,410
As for the rest,

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,700
I have nothing to say.

141
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,900
Loving someone

142
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,140
is like holding a torch.

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,410
Walking against the wind

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,700
will inevitably burn your hands.

145
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,170
Captain, who got their hands burned?

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,370
When did it happen?

147
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,290
Captain, you don't know either?

148
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,140
Miss Huanyang doesn't love you at all.

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,270
Why force her?

150
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,110
Stop talking.

151
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,170
It seems you've known.

152
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,350
After we found out the body

153
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,700
was not Xu Shenxing,

154
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,370
I went to Huanyinglou.

155
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,730
Madam Rong told me

156
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,850
you went to Huanyinglou

157
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,470
only after Huanyang became
a singing girl there.

158
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,540
Before that,

159
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,790
you were a chief escort

160
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,090
in Jiangzhou Hengsheng Escort Agency.

161
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,290
You gave up a comfortable life

162
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,780
to work at Huanyinglou.

163
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,670
Besides love,

164
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,260
I can't think of any other reasons.

165
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
I understand you.

166
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
You gave up everything

167
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,810
to protect Huanyang.

168
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,750
In the end,

169
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,120
she resolutely

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,810
threw herself into Xu Shenxing's arms.

171
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
You felt resentment.

172
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,220
I treated her well with my whole heart,

173
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,660
but she ignored it.

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,500
What's so good about Xu Shenxing?

175
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,620
He's just a playboy.

176
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,020
How could he only love her?

177
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
But

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,810
she was so stubborn.

179
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,330
I thought

180
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,980
after she was expelled from Huanyinglou,

181
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,740
she would slowly forget Xu Shenxing.

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,210
Huanyang, I brought you some snacks.

183
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,070
Sorry, I didn't see anything.

184
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,500
I... I'll put the things on the ground.

185
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,140
I'll go out. I'll wait for you outside.

186
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,270
Don't go.

187
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,540
Didn't you miss me?

188
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
Huanyang.

189
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,380
What are you doing?

190
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,140
Don't you like me?

191
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
Huanyang.

192
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,170
I like you.

193
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,720
I...

194
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,330
I really like you.

195
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,810
I like you too.

196
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,860
Shenxing.

197
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,660
If the world had one less man
like Xu Shenxing,

198
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,090
there would be fewer girls
like Huanyang getting hurt.

199
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,050
So I hate him.

200
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,620
He ruined Huanyang.

201
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,870
No,

202
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,450
he ruined the beauty in my heart.

203
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,690
So because of this,

204
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,440
you planted the seed

205
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,570
of hatred in your heart.

206
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,480
You've been looking for a chance.

207
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,640
But Xu Shenxing never

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,840
appeared at Huanyang's place again.

209
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,860
Until the night of the 18th,

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,040
you discovered that Zhuang Si

211
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,950
wanted to kill Xu Shenxing

212
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,880
at Huanyinglou.

213
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,980
You were very happy

214
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,050
and intended to just be a bystander.

215
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,360
Until the scribe Shen Yuan

216
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,330
appeared,

217
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,330
he disrupted everything.

218
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,860
(Shen Yuan, scribe)

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,140
Please deliver it to No. 58 Jiangnan Street.

220
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,380
Unfortunately,

221
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,000
the butler Cao of the Xu Residence

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,660
paid no attention to that letter.

223
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,930
Now that Shen Yuan is dead,

224
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,500
I have no way of knowing

225
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,620
how he initially learned

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,930
that Zhuang Si wanted
to kill Xu Shenxing.

227
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Detective Qin,

228
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,310
why didn't Shen Yuan

229
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,810
go straight to Mr. Xu

230
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,860
and tell him?

231
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,950
Zhuang Si was Xu Shenxing's friend

232
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,270
since childhood

233
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,500
and also his business partner.

234
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,230
It's like someone telling you

235
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,430
that Captain Song wants to kill you.

236
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,270
Would you believe it?

237
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,620
I would never believe it.

238
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,260
I learned from the girls at Huanyinglou

239
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,410
that Shen Yuan had
a childhood sweetheart.

240
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,880
That girl's father

241
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,740
was a gambler.

242
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,230
So after losing all his money,

243
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,690
he sold her to Huanyinglou

244
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
to pay off his debts.

245
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,900
This led to her tragic death.

246
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,070
Although Xu Shenxing was a playboy,

247
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,280
he treated the girls at Huanyinglou

248
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,120
very well.

249
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Shen Yuan's lover

250
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,140
had also received many favors from him.

251
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,980
Therefore, Shen Yuan did not want
anything to happen to Xu Shenxing.

252
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,570
But besides that,

253
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,540
there was an even more important reason.

254
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,310
Shen Yuan knew

255
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,170
that he had an infectious lung disease.

256
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,810
He would die soon.

257
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,720
I understand it now.

258
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,500
If a murder occurred,

259
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,910
Mr. Xu would know

260
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,000
that someone wanted to hurt him.

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,260
He would then be more vigilant.

262
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,980
But he didn't know,

263
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,450
besides that Zhuang Si wanted his life,

264
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
there was also you.

265
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,090
Since he didn't want to live anymore,

266
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,210
I'll just let him die.

267
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,500
So you used him

268
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,090
to set up the scene,

269
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,570
making us believe he was Xu Shenxing.

270
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,110
But the real Xu Shenxing

271
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,210
had already been swapped by you.

272
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,600
Later then, to interfere with

273
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
our investigation,

274
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,410
you misled us step by step

275
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,860
to make us believe

276
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,140
that Zhuang Si did this.

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,240
You even

278
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,930
killed that unfortunate killer.

279
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,170
Your analysis

280
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,990
is all correct.

281
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,720
Quickly tell me,

282
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,260
is Xu Shenxing dead or alive?

283
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,240
Where exactly is he?

284
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,090
I have nothing to tell.

285
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,330
Where exactly is Shenxing?

286
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,050
Where is my son?

287
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,570
Take a guess.

288
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,990
Are you going to tell or not?

289
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,380
- Director Xu.
- I have plenty of ways to make you talk.

290
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,230
- Director Xu.
- No way.

291
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,080
- Try it.
- Director Xu.

292
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,150
- Director Xu.
- Calm down.

293
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,550
- Director Xu.
- Director Xu!

294
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,860
Director Xu, we are the police!

295
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,910
Try it.

296
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,740
Hand Gu Sui over to me.

297
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,270
I promise

298
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,170
to bring Shenxing back to you.

299
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,860
Captain Song.

300
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,050
I'm counting on you.

301
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,140
Captain Song.

302
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,790
I thought your interrogation techniques

303
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,450
were as impressive as your shooting skills.

304
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,740
But to my surprise,

305
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,860
they are rather disappointing.

306
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,560
I'm tired.

307
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm going to take a nap.

308
