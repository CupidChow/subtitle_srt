2
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,380
(Governor's Mansion)

3
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,550
Commander.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,850
Chen Biao has taken Ningcheng

5
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,090
and incorporated He Guang's troops.

6
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,420
He has seized a lot of weapons.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,180
His momentum is strong.

8
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,010
What do you think

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,210
our chances of winning this battle are?

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,650
Given the current situation,

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,980
it might be difficult for us to defeat him.

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
Unless...

13
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,850
We've hidden the resource over the years.

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,130
Now it's time to bring it to light.

15
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,510
Understood.

16
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,340
(Jiangzhou Prison)

17
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,580
I'm Song He from the detective squad.

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,860
I need to have a word with Qin Huole.

19
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,130
Alright, Captain Song.

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,410
Isn't it a bit too grand for you

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,090
to send me off like this?

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,580
Jiangzhou is about to go to war again.

23
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,670
I've heard.

24
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,410
Does Commander Lei have a chance
of winning?

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,020
My father wants to send me away.

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm leaving Jiangzhou today.

27
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,630
You're leaving?

28
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,580
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,250
The war is imminent.

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,930
I can't be a burden to my father.

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,650
But I really

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,460
enjoy working with you all

33
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,780
to solve cases

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,060
and fight for Jiangzhou.

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,000
Xiaofan,

36
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,110
don't cry.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Yes.

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
The three of us

39
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,180
will always be the best partners.

40
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,020
In the West, when people part,

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,650
they always give each other
a sincere hug.

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
It's a pity

43
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,210
that I can't do that today.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,280
How about we...

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,600
Thank you all.

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,780
Once the war is over,

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,930
I'll come back immediately.

48
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,670
Take care.

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,900
You take care too.

50
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,300
When you come back,

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,580
everything will be better.

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
Definitely.

53
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,390
Bye.

54
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Go in.

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,440
Hello everyone.

56
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,390
Watch me.

57
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,870
If you're not convinced, let's battle.

58
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,930
One more, one more time.

59
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,160
Alright, alright, again.

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,380
(Prisoner You Youyou)

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
One more. Come here.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,260
You Youyou,

63
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,190
got imprisoned in the early years
of the Republic of China.

64
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,810
He's a veteran prisoner there,

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
who is well-informed

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,010
and famous for being a know-it-all.

67
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,500
If you can get him to talk,

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,360
I believe the time to find out the truth

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,220
will be greatly shortened.

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,130
However, this person is peculiar.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,860
It will take some effort to get close
to him.

72
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,470
Mr. You.

73
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,420
- Wrong.
- Let me.

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,740
It's not mister.

75
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,540
It's master.

76
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,200
Master You.

77
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,360
Step aside.

78
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,810
You're blocking my wind.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Master You.

80
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,570
My name is Qin Huole.

81
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,860
You can also call me Huole.

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,060
I know, I know.

83
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,060
The famous Detective Qin.

84
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,270
What's up?

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,450
Tired of being a detective

86
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,980
and come here for a change?

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,620
How do you know me?

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,060
Lawyer Qin Weilian's son.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,870
You just returned from studying abroad,

90
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,500
and were all thinking about
seeking justice for people.

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,130
I'm just puzzled.

92
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,920
You're young

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,250
and from a rich family.

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,480
Why don't you just

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
be a rich kid?

96
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,790
Have some fun

97
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,720
and live a lavish life.

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,550
Why are you messing around here?

99
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,720
Do you really want to be

100
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,620
a hero so much?

101
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,620
Who would want to come here?

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,130
I heard there's someone like you.

103
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,190
They say you've traveled far and wide,

104
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,500
had your leg run over by a train,

105
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,310
and carried a single knife on your back

106
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,310
to go

107
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,420
anywhere you want.

108
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,710
When I heard that,

109
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,010
I thought, wow,

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,310
I must come

111
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,220
and visit you myself.

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,790
I didn't expect

113
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,130
you to be such a talkative person.

114
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,010
Keep talking. I'd love to hear that.

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880
Thanks.

116
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,180
If you like it,

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,660
I'll continue...

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,500
As for the thing you want to know,

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,930
I can't talk about it.

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
Master You.

121
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,690
I have a rule.

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,840
I mean what I said.

123
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,220
Don't come to me again.

124
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,330
But I haven't even asked yet.

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,300
How do you know you can't talk about it?

126
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,160
What if I say I can help you

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,100
overturn the case

128
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,180
and let you walk

129
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,420
out of here openly?

130
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,370
I have read your case file.

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,500
In the Yangliuzhuang case,

132
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,870
though you have confessed
and accepted the punishment,

133
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,690
this case is still full of doubts.

134
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,710
Master You,

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,770
you should have heard

136
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,360
that I assisted the detective squad

137
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,930
in solving several major cases.

138
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,680
I've heard of it.

139
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,750
So...

140
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,590
Unfortunately,

141
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,540
I don't want to go out.

142
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,890
Do you want to know why?

143
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,770
In this small area,

144
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,330
I am the master.

145
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,130
But if I go out,

146
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,250
I am just a nobody.

147
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Kid,

148
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
you have a face that

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,980
is not so annoying.

150
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,360
I'll give you a piece

151
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,460
of free advice.

152
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,820
In life,

153
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,460
try to turn a blind eye

154
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,940
and you'll live longer.

155
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,420
(Allegiance to Lei)

156
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,750
Commander.

157
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,580
Have you sent Xiaofan away?

158
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,770
I have told Qingmang

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,230
to send a telegram back

160
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,220
as soon as they arrive.

161
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,470
Please rest assured.

162
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,820
Is there anything else?

163
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Commander.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,660
The news that Chen Biao is going
to attack the city

165
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,560
has already spread around.

166
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,650
Now the people in Jiangzhou are in panic.

167
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,230
I believe that at this time,
we must not let chaos ensue.

168
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,250
If we want to prevent chaos,

169
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,100
we need to control both the police
and the prison.

170
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,070
What do you mean?

171
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,150
The prisoners

172
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,100
are not some kind persons.

173
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,990
If they hear the news that the city
is going to be attacked,

174
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,250
some will develop ill intentions.

175
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
Even if we suppress them,

176
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,360
it will be very troublesome.

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
What about the police?

178
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,700
Besides Lei's Army,

179
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,100
the only armed force in the city

180
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,700
is from the police station.

181
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,940
If they...

182
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
No need to say more.

183
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,340
You've been with me for so many years.

184
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,590
You've made progress.

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,740
It's all thanks to your guidance.

186
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,100
Do you have any good ideas?

187
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,350
Commander,

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
I have thought about it.

189
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,370
It's simple to control the prison.

190
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,590
As long as you order them

191
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,080
to raise the alert level

192
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,920
to the highest,

193
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,980
we can be at ease.

194
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,370
But the police station...

195
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,340
Isn't Xu injured?

196
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,410
Then starting today,

197
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,820
the affairs in the police station

198
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,770
will be handled by you personally.

199
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Yes, sir.

200
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,460
Make sure

201
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,530
to deal with these two issues properly.

202
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Understood.

203
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,180
(Jiangzhou Prison)

204
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,620
Just eat this?

205
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,340
Yes, it's quite thin.

206
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,340
It's getting less and less.

207
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,470
Thank you.

208
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,470
Next.

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,010
The porridge is almost gone.

210
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
That guy is here.

211
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,170
Let's see what happens.

212
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
Let's chat.

213
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,010
- What are you doing?
- Don't move.

214
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
Don't move.

215
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,830
Let go.

216
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,710
What are you guys doing?

217
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,470
Take a look.

218
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,460
Indeed, a rich son.

219
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,110
(Prisoner Liu Sanbao)
Such tender skin,

220
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,700
like a woman's.

221
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,830
Liu Sanbao,

222
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,980
nicknamed San,

223
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,940
a notorious bully in west Jiangzhou.

224
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,390
He has injured and maimed people

225
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,230
many times in prison,

226
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,170
and has a large number of henchmen.

227
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
When you encounter him,

228
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,620
you must be very careful.

229
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,860
I was wondering who it was.

230
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,480
Turns out it's the famous

231
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,410
Master Sanbao.

232
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,320
You are quite informed, kid.

233
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
Master Sanbao,

234
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,870
it doesn't feel good to talk like this.

235
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,130
Why don't you do me a favor
and let me go first?

236
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,460
Let you go?

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,440
If I let you go,

238
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,130
who will eat

239
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,290
such a delicious thing?

240
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,700
Detective Qin, tell me,

241
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,250
do you want to eat it civilly
or forcefully?

242
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,010
Can you explain

243
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
the difference?

244
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,170
Eating it civilly

245
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,130
means everyone watches you eat.

246
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,250
Eating it forcefully

247
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,220
means everyone feeds you.

248
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,230
What if

249
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,230
I don't want either?

250
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,290
You didn't have to

251
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,050
if you were a detective.

252
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,770
Unfortunately,

253
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,050
now you're

254
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,340
just like us.

255
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,530
Newcomers

256
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,620
all have to go through this.

257
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,220
Eat it and we'll make peace.

258
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,530
Newcomer, what do you say?

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,700
Should I feed you?

260
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,100
- Eat it.
- Hurry up.

261
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,700
(Chen Zou, captain of Jiangzhou Prison)

262
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Warden.

263
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,500
What's going on with you today?

264
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,290
You're even concerned
about the prisoners' meals.

265
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,980
Today?

266
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,620
(Duan Ming, warden of Jiangzhou Prison)

267
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,580
What I mean is

268
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,740
such a trivial issue
shouldn't trouble you.

269
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,340
This is my negligence.

270
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,050
Chen Zou,

271
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,510
do you know

272
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,510
what your biggest weakness is?

273
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,350
Please enlighten me.

274
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,370
It's being overly cautious.

275
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,230
Eat it.

276
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,940
Eat it, eat it!

277
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,750
What are you doing?

278
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,990
Look at this kid, so delicate.

279
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,410
He's not like us rough men.

280
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,220
Don't accidentally hurt him.

281
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,580
Even Master You can be nice?

282
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,010
If I remember correctly,

283
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
you set the rule

284
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,940
back then.

285
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,050
When I first came in,

286
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,980
I had to eat a whole big bowl of this.

287
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,230
So,

288
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,890
are you going

289
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,750
to break the rule

290
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,980
for this kid today?

291
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,950
No,

292
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,650
the rule can't be broken.

293
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,480
I mean, this...

294
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,870
Then you should

295
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,650
find a cool place to stay.

296
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,170
Don't spoil everyone's fun.

297
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
- Hurry up and leave.
- Right.

298
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,370
- Hurry up and go.
- Go, go.

299
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,360
- Hurry up and eat.
- Eat quickly.

300
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,650
We must watch him eat it.

301
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,800
Eat it.

302
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,350
Chew quickly.

303
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,440
No one can cheat.

304
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
- No cheating, hurry up.
- Hurry up.

305
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,800
What's going on?

306
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,770
Why are you so excited?

307
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,980
You even stopped eating.

308
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,980
It's nothing.

309
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,720
The warden is asking you a question.
Answer it.

310
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,560
Yes, sir.

311
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,940
Warden,

312
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,960
this newcomer

313
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,940
is wasting food.

314
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,770
We're teaching him the rules.

315
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,500
Is that so?

316
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,940
No, I...

317
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Warden,

318
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,050
that's how it is.

319
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,620
I can testify.

320
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,820
That's potato.

321
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,940
It should taste pretty good.

322
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,530
Alright, I won't disturb you.

323
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,820
Carry on.

324
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,750
Thank you.

325
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,580
How are you? Do you feel better now?

326
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,770
I feel much better now.

327
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,050
But my stomach still hurts a bit.

328
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,990
This procedure

329
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,890
could have been skipped.

330
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,030
However, I consider

331
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,200
that you have a mission to complete.

332
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,620
To avoid arousing suspicion
among other prisoners,

333
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,800
I suggested Captain Song

334
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,960
keep it.

335
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Did he agree?

336
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,740
Duan Ming, warden of Jiangzhou Prison.

337
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,620
(Honest and upright)
He's a reliable friend.

338
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,080
When you get inside,

339
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,200
he will find ways to protect you.

340
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,290
Go to him if you have any needs.

341
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,820
And go to him to contact me.

342
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,000
I want to give Song He a call.

343
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
Alright.

344
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,350
I'll call him.

345
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,680
Hello.

346
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,700
This is Duan Ming from Jiangzhou Prison.

347
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,250
I'd like to speak to Captain Song He.

348
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,110
Please hold on.

349
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,160
Captain Song is out.

350
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,280
I'll go get him now.

351
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
Captain Song.

352
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,710
Captain Song.

353
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,740
- Yes?
- You have a call.

354
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,940
It's from Jiangzhou Prison.

355
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,230
Alright.

356
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,620
Jiangzhou Prison. This is Chen Zou.

357
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
Come in.

358
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,400
Warden,

359
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,490
this is the renovation plan
for the third cell block.

360
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,830
Please review it.

361
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,050
Hello, this is Song He.

362
