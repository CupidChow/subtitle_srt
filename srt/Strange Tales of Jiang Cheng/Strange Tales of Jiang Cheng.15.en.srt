2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,940
(Panlong Hill)

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,490
You hurriedly called me here.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,410
Are you sure the third one is here?

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,890
Let's look around. Hurry up.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,640
What time is it?

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,280
5:30 p.m.

8
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,590
Let's split up.

9
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,440
Meet over there in 15 minutes.

10
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,550
Okay.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,640
Don't be afraid.

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,840
The sun hasn't set yet.

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
Wandering ghosts can't come out.

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,690
I mean to say,

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,040
if there are any new findings,

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,250
notify me immediately.

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,970
This murderer
is exceptionally intelligent.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,720
The obstacles will only get harder.

19
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,190
Got it.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,800
One, two, push!

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,240
Go!

22
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,290
One, two, push!

23
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,830
One, two, push!

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,050
One, two, push!

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,290
Push!

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,800
Push!

27
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,070
How come you two

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,680
can't push a car out?

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
Try again.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,290
Again?

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,400
Fine, I'll do it, you get in.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,680
No, no, Miss Fan,

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,110
I didn't mean that.

34
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,960
You get in.

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,050
I'll push it.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,110
I'll push it one more time.

37
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,920
No, I'll push ten more times.

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,270
Put some effort into it.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Lieutenant Zou,

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
try again.

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
Try again.

42
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,010
Again, try again.

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,270
Come on.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,640
One, two, push!

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
How is it?

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
Any new findings?

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
Tell me,

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
where

49
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,870
is the hardest place to find

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,800
when a corpse is hidden?

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,040
A corpse?

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Yes.

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,520
There are too many places to hide it.

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,850
- For example...
- For example,

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,200
to hide it among a pile of corpses.

56
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,570
Hiding one target

57
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,960
with

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
another one,

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,170
isn't that the same logic?

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Makes sense.

61
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,440
This fits

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,330
the murderer's usual style.

63
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,400
Aren't you going to help?

64
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,550
Nails.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,210
Seven minutes left.

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,280
Three,

67
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,190
two, one,

68
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,510
pull.

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,550
How are you? Wake up.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,170
How are you?

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
Don't be afraid. We are police.

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,680
Oleander flowers.

73
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,870
Sir.

74
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,750
Sir.

75
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,400
Sir!

76
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,850
Hold on, wake up.

77
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,680
Hold on, we'll take you to the hospital.

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
- Sir.
- Sir.

79
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,360
Sir.

80
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,990
Sir!

81
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,090
6:00 p.m. sharp.

82
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,340
(All targets are dead.
The answer is not in any novels.)

83
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,160
We

84
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,670
lost.

85
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
When will this rain stop?

86
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,550
Miss Fan.

87
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't think this rain will stop soon.

88
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,320
What should we do then?

89
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm familiar with this road.

90
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,050
There's a tea garden ahead.
We can take shelter there.

91
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Is it safe in this wilderness?

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,410
Alright, let's go.

93
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,940
(Tea Garden)

94
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,360
Miss, are we disturbing you?

95
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,360
Sit down. We're okay.

96
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,400
She's a beauty.

97
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,360
But fate is cruel.

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,150
(Mute girl)

99
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,520
Mr. Huo, you're very compassionate.

100
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,790
After trudging through the muddy path,

101
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,520
seeing such clear eyes,

102
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,850
everyone would come up with the line,

103
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,120
"Every cloud has a silver lining".

104
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,280
So, will this scene

105
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,810
also be included in your novel?

106
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,850
Give Detective Cheng Sen

107
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,930
a perfect encounter too.

108
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,090
Lieutenant Zou, you're joking.

109
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,080
Just joking.

110
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,960
Well...

111
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,110
Miss,

112
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,730
do you also like Huo's novels?

113
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,000
Girl, you're too kind.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,610
Let me sign this book for you.

115
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,300
(The Death Lantern
By Huo Qingxin)

116
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,080
Cheng Sen.

117
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,970
Are you saying you like Cheng Sen?

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,040
Is there anyone like Cheng Sen,

119
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,330
a righteous detective?

120
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,310
Captain, the third victim's identity

121
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,240
has been confirmed.

122
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,080
His name is Xu San'er.

123
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,450
He was a traveling doctor
from Jiangzhou.

124
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,640
Have you notified his family?

125
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,330
He was alone,

126
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
with no family.

127
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,280
A Chinese teacher,

128
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,810
a tea house manager,

129
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
and a traveling doctor.

130
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
What is the connection

131
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,330
between them?

132
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,240
Novels

133
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,930
are fictional.

134
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,570
The imperfectionsin reality

135
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
gives fiction

136
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
its meaning.

137
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,730
Otherwise, who would read it?

138
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,310
Girl, today,

139
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,360
I won't lie in front of you.

140
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
At least I haven't seen anyone

141
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,000
like Cheng Sen in the book yet.

142
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
But maybe there will be one
in the future.

143
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,600
Miss,

144
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,120
although I don't know

145
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,570
if there is a Cheng Sen in this world,

146
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
I do know

147
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,280
there are very good detectives.

148
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,450
Just like my two good friends,

149
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,850
they are young and promising,

150
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,880
striving to fight against criminals,

151
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,330
upholding law and order,

152
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
and protecting the peace of the people.

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,430
Do you know
that sometimes telling the truth

154
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,490
can make people sad?

155
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,200
Miss Fan,

156
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,690
this rain won't stop anytime soon.

157
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,280
We can only rest here tonight.

158
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,040
Tomorrow morning when the rain stops,

159
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,790
we will go to Xiyin Temple

160
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,690
to find Monk Chenhai.

161
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes.

162
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,540
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

163
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,150
Take a look,

164
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,280
do you recognize this person?

165
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,910
Look carefully.

166
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
You don't?

167
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,480
Don't be afraid.

168
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,680
A corpse

169
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
is the last message

170
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,760
left by a person in this world.

171
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,880
It will help us find the truth

172
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,850
and justice for the deceased.

173
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,930
Take another look.

174
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,880
I've seen this person before.

175
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,970
Half a month ago,

176
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,000
it seemed to be this person

177
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,880
who came to my house looking for Han Da.

178
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,570
Think again.

179
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,390
Are there other clues
you might have missed?

180
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,450
For example,
the content of their conversation.

181
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,760
I didn't hear a single word clearly.

182
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,600
Maybe,

183
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,610
it was related to the child.

184
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,330
For so many years,

185
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,730
Han Da and I had tried to have a child,

186
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,450
but no luck.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,970
But that day was different.

188
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,490
He looked very happy.

189
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
Anything else?

190
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
Oh right,

191
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,330
there's one more thing I want to ask.

192
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,090
The tea leaves from your teahouse,

193
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,360
Shilixiang tea,

194
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,510
where did you get it from?

195
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
We have our own tea garden.

196
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,570
We don't need to purchase goods.

197
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,030
Where is the tea garden?

198
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,610
Next to Xiyin Temple on Nu Mountain.

199
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,630
That's right.

200
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,520
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

201
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,880
Maybe the tea wasn't even

202
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
bought from Wuyuxuan Teahouse.

203
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
It came from the tea garden.

204
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,870
Chen,

205
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,120
go get my painting.

206
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,240
Yes, sir.

207
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,600
That's right.

208
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,160
This is our tea garden.

209
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,320
Thank you, Miss.

210
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,040
We will come to see you again.

211
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,160
Why are you here?

212
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,360
Hello, may we have a cup of tea?
