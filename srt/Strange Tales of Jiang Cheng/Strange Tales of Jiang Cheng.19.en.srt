=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 19=

2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,340
(Jiangzhou Police Station)

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
No matter how big the issue is,

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,300
we still need to eat.

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,880
Xiaofan.

6
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,320
vegetables are unpalatable.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
Let's have some ribs.

8
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,310
Xiaofan,

9
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,110
if you have something on your mind,

10
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,970
just tell us.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,770
Yes, speak up,

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,330
so we can help you.

13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,060
At that time,

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,960
I shouldn't have

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,410
left Yinyin alone there.

16
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,290
- School's out!
- School's out!

17
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,290
School's out!

18
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,660
- Goodbye, Sir.
- Goodbye, Sir.

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,100
- Okay, Sir.
- Goodbye.

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,380
After school that day...

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,260
(Young Xiaofan)

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
(Young Yinyin)
Xiaofan, watch me.

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,900
Yinyin volunteered
to get the kite in the tree.

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,130
- She fell.
- Yinyin!

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,060
Yinyin, are you okay?

26
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,120
Wait here.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,130
I'll go find help.

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,470
If Yinyin hadn't fallen

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,560
while trying to

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,440
reach the kite...

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,280
Hurry up.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,660
She wouldn't have twisted her ankle.

33
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,350
If I hadn't left her at that time

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,820
to get that rickshaw,

35
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,390
she wouldn't have...

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,110
Xiaofan,

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,850
don'tblame yourself so much.

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,270
The kidnappers had already

39
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,170
made Yinyin their target.

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,100
Even if those things didn't happen,

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,340
they would find another chance to do it.

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,570
It was just that

43
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,780
you happened to be there.

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,340
After the incident,

45
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,250
I went to the police station to see her.

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,850
Yinyin.

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,950
Yinyin,

48
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,620
you're back.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Xiaofan,

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm here to say goodbye.

51
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,130
Don't go.

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,340
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,050
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,100
I shouldn't have left you alone.

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,100
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,490
That dream felt so real.

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,780
I always felt like

58
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,970
it was really Yinyin talking to me.

59
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,100
Over the years,

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,660
I've seen too many corpses.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,970
I've tried to communicate with them,

62
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,350
and think

63
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,290
from the murderer's view.

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,610
Why did they commit the crime?

65
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,260
Why did they kill?

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,610
I believe you truly saw Yinyin.

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,260
Because of her encouragement,

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,220
you became a coroner.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,170
And you have indeed helped many people

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,460
and delivered justice.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,660
After all these years,

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,350
Yinyin's murderers

73
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,020
are still at large.

74
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
Now they have kidnapped her sister.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,440
I...

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,190
Don't worry.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
This time, we are here.

78
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,610
They will definitely not succeed.

79
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,750
Trust us.

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,260
We will bring Niannian back.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,730
Kidnapping without demanding ransom

82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,460
is clearly not a typical murder case.

83
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,580
It is a psychological crime.

84
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,230
The three brothers

85
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,700
killed three children in succession.

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,140
I don't believethat one accident

87
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,360
could lead to a cooling-off period

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,460
of seven years.

89
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
So there are two reasons

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
for their disappearance.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
First,

92
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,670
they left Jiangzhou

93
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,350
and continued committing crimes
elsewhere.

94
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,790
Second, they were imprisoned

95
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,970
and lost their freedom.

96
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,260
That's easy to prove.

97
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,760
We can ask colleagues in nearby cities

98
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,790
to help us,

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,350
and see if there are any related records.

100
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,850
As for the second possibility,

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,800
it's even easier.

102
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,240
One of the three brothers

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,290
was shot in the calf.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,490
We can check the prison records.

105
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,290
Captain, leave it to me.

106
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,900
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

107
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,070
I am thinking,

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
what could have driven

109
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,200
the three brothers

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,140
to return to their old ways?

111
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,540
Maybe,

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,850
it's not that at all.

113
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,110
Perhaps,

114
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,610
they were waiting.

115
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,020
You mean,

116
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,780
they want to make people suffer more?

117
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,810
Repeating the nightmare from seven years ago

118
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,160
of He Lingyu and his wife

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,170
once again,

120
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,540
is there anything more cruel than that?

121
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,600
Captain.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
You have a call.

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
It's from Mao Shuai.

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,960
Alright.

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,290
Hello, this is Song He.

126
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
What?

127
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,170
Keep He Lingyu and his wifecalm.

128
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,310
I'm heading over there right now.

129
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,930
The kidnappers sent a ransom letter.

130
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,600
(He Residence)

131
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,030
(Mr. He, prepare 1,500 silver dollars.)
This was discovered in the mailbox

132
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,220
an hour ago by the servant
at He Residence.

133
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,020
(Mr. He, prepare 500 silver dollars.)
This is the letter from seven years ago.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,780
Are there any suspicious individuals?

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
Captain Song.

136
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,540
Thank you.

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,970
I'm late.

138
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,850
The conditions here are simple.

139
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,520
Allow me to apologize

140
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
for the inconvenience.

141
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,810
No. Mr. He, please don't say that.

142
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,900
We are fine here.

143
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,800
If the kidnappers find out

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,080
that the detective squad is involved.

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,710
I'm afraid it won't be good
for Niannian.

146
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,660
Thanks, everyone.

147
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,790
Come on.

148
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,900
Have some water.

149
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,920
Mrs. Qin, right?

150
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,750
Yes.

151
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,540
You retrieved the letter?

152
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,800
Yes.

153
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Maybe the letter
was already in the mailbox

154
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,100
before the postman arrived?

155
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Not necessarily.

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,540
What if the postman

157
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,810
is one of the kidnappers?

158
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Or

159
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,220
the kidnapper is colluding
with Mrs Qin.

160
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,710
The letter was placed by Mrs. Qin

161
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,290
before she retrieved it.

162
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,510
No, no.

163
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,640
I'm Mrs. He's maid.

164
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,050
I have been with her since I was young.

165
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,830
It's been many years since I came here.

166
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,790
I watched both young ladies grow up.

167
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,260
How could I harm them?

168
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,120
Miss Xiaofan knows that.

169
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
She used to come to the house often.

170
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,950
Mrs. Qin, don't be nervous.

171
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,260
Officer Qin was just speculating.

172
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,930
It is different from seven years ago.

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
This time, they asked Mr. He

174
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,330
to prepare 1,500 silver dollars,

175
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,630
and divide them into three boxes

176
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,040
which will be delivered by one person

177
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,020
to three different locations.

178
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,190
As long as they get
all the silver dollars,

179
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,050
they will release the girl.

180
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,980
I don't care how many
silver dollars are needed,

181
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,540
(He Lingyu)
as long as we can save Niannian.

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,860
Then, Mr. He,

183
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,520
please prepare the silver dollars first.

184
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,360
Alright.

185
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,620
I will prepare them right away.

186
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,660
I'll go prepare them now.

187
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Mrs. He.

188
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,210
It's me, Xiaofan.

189
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,020
Xiaofan.

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,050
You're a big girl now.

191
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,910
Come, sit.

192
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,750
Alright.

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
Mrs. He.

194
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,140
Over the past years,

195
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,270
I didn't dare

196
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,720
to visit you and Mr. He.

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,740
Please don't blame me.

198
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,620
(He Lingyu's wife)
Like I told you before,

199
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,050
Yinyin's death

200
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,740
isn't your fault.

201
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,880
I don't know what sins I committed
in my past life

202
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,410
to deserve this.

203
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,740
Yinyin was gone.

204
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,020
Now they

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,500
won't even spare Niannian.

206
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,380
Mrs. He.

207
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,620
Do you remember

208
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,690
what you were doing

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,090
when Niannian was taken?

210
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,360
Madam, Madam.

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,240
(Niannian, He Lingyu's daughter)
You have a phone call

212
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,880
from Hengfeng Silk Store.

213
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,660
They said you ordered
two sets of qipao there.

214
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Niannian,

215
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,210
play here for a while by yourself.

216
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,170
I will come back after taking the call.

217
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,810
At that time, I went to answer the phone.

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Hello?

219
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,210
The caller had hung up.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,620
I felt a bit strange

221
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,980
but didn't think much of it.

222
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,990
Niannian.

223
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,720
Niannian.

224
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,110
Niannian.

225
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,630
Niannian.

226
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,390
Niannian.

227
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,020
Niannian!

228
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,910
This letter

229
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,270
was not written by the three brothers
from seven years ago.

230
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,290
What? Not the same group?

231
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,450
Same stationery.

232
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,810
Same format.

233
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,980
Same handwriting style.

234
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,290
Seven years have passed.

235
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
The handwriting

236
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,570
would not remain unchanged.

237
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,860
So it is a copycat.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,070
But how did he know

239
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,500
the content of the original letter?

240
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
Without the real ransom letter,

241
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,410
how did he make a duplicate?

242
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,270
In the police station,

243
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,210
there must be a mole.

244
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,510
Mao,

245
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,540
I'm counting on you.

246
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,810
You got it.

247
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,330
But counting what on me?

248
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,400
Find out the officers who were involved

249
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,550
in He Yinyin's kidnapping case

250
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,790
and investigate them thoroughly.

251
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,630
Yes, sir.

252
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,160
Mr. He will definitely arrange

253
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,380
for Mrs. Qin to deliver the ransom.

254
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,210
I'll follow her then

255
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,810
to see if there are any clues.

256
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,990
Also,

257
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,360
according to the ransom letter,

258
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,840
the ransom is to be divided into three parts,

259
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,780
and placed at the entrance of Fuxiang Teahouse,

260
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,910
by the erhu player
in the bustling northern city,

261
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,500
and in the mailbox opposite Yuehua Inn.

262
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,140
I've arranged for people to keep watch.

263
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,390
Just play it by ear.

264
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,790
Captain,

265
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
I found it.

266
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,660
(Luo Bingchang's investigation report)

267
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,740
Luo Bingchang?

268
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes.

269
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,050
Luo Bingchang

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,760
was one of the main investigators

271
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,900
of He Yinyin's kidnapping case.

272
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,600
However, the year after the case,

273
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,910
he was expelled from the detective squad.

274
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,090
Here's wine.

275
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,500
Fragrant and mellow wine!

276
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,200
Where is he now?

277
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,050
He's still in Jiangzhou,

278
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,170
but he's a postman now.

279
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,990
A postman?

280
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,160
Sachets, pendants. Come and take a look.

281
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,290
Mr. Qin.

282
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,190
I'm really sorry. I was tricked.

283
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,380
The kidnapper hired a beggar.

284
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,110
We'll talk about it later.

285
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,150
Go back now and keep watching.

286
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,990
Yes.

287
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,690
It's so scary.

288
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,470
Stop looking. Let's go quickly.

289
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,310
Let's go.

290
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,140
It's really scary.

291
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
Seven stab wounds.

292
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,520
The wounds

293
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,120
are very consistent.

294
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,500
They spread all over the body.

295
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,480
From the strangulation marks
on the victim's neck,

296
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,380
it can be determined

297
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,190
that the murderer used a rope

298
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,290
to control the victim.

299
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,690
The fatal one is the stab to the chest.

300
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,660
The stab wounds are consistent

301
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,380
and spread all over the body.

302
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,920
It indicates that the murderer

303
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,000
was very calm

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,930
when he made every stab.

305
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,690
Otherwise, the wounds

306
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,620
would be both concentrated
and messy.

307
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,630
The murderer

308
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,280
probably wanted the victim

309
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,170
to feel pain

310
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,980
to satisfy his psychological needs.

311
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,500
Otherwise, with his knife skills,

312
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,050
he could have killed him with one stab.

313
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,870
So,

314
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,270
the fatal stab to the chest

315
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,110
was the last one made.

316
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,950
After killing the victim,

317
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,190
the murderer did not take the ransom.

318
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,310
He was trying to tell us

319
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,000
that he was not in cahoots
with the postman.

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,030
He despised the postman
for being his copycat.

321
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,290
He had no interest in money.

322
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,720
It wasn't for the money.

323
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,500
He despised the postman's copycat,

324
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,380
and kidnapped
He Lingyu's daughter Niannian.

325
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,440
From this perspective,

326
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,380
the Wu brothers
are still the prime suspects.

327
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,480
Captain Song.

328
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
How's it going?

329
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,980
I inquired with colleagues
in neighboring cities.

330
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,380
There are some kidnapping cases,

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,270
but none similar to this one.

332
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,150
Also, I went

333
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,170
to the prison

334
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,360
and checked all the records,

335
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,780
but found no matching cases.

336
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,410
It seems they really hadn't committed
any more crimes.

337
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,930
Maybe they're scared

338
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
and have been hiding.

339
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,780
We must have

340
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,140
missed out

341
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,910
on some key clues.

342
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,340
