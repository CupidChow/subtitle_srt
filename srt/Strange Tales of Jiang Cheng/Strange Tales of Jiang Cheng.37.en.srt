=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 37=

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,100
As far as I know, Master Long has
treated you well.

3
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,220
You were the person he trusted the most.

4
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,580
Yes.

5
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,380
Why did you kill him?

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,460
I didn't.

7
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,860
I didn't mean to kill Master Long.

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,900
I didn't mean to.

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,260
Explain yourself clearly.

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,420
Father.

11
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,940
Father.

12
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,260
Father!

13
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,260
It's like...

14
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,860
like I had

15
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,820
a strange dream.

16
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,660
Are you saying

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,900
you don't remember the killing process

18
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,140
and why you did it?

19
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,820
Captain.

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,900
This is very similar to being poisoned
by datura.

21
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,780
Datura poison

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,660
is to bring out the desires

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,820
that already exist in one's heart.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,100
Even if you were poisoned,

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,780
you've had the intention

26
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,700
to kill Master Long.

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,780
I didn't.

28
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,420
I admit I killed him.

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,300
What else am I afraid to tell you?

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,620
Then why did you run?

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,740
If I didn't run,

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,020
Juta and others would hack me to death.

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,180
I killed Master Long.

34
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,100
I will pay with my life.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,620
But I just want to know the truth.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,060
Have you seen this?

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,700
This belongs to Qin Huole.

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,700
Why did he go for Master Long?

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
He was asking about something.

40
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,580
What was it?

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,500
He brought a photo

42
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,180
to ask if Master Long had seen it.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,660
A photo?

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,700
Yes.

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,020
I took a glance at the photo.

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,100
It seemed

47
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,460
to be a wing.

48
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,900
Remember,

49
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,220
from now on, if anyone asks about this,

50
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,540
you must insist

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,740
that we didn't meet

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,260
tonight.

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,340
Master Long is talking to you.

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,500
Did you hear him?

55
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,340
Master Long.

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,780
Master Long.

57
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,540
There is something I must tell you.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,620
Those cheating ways
in your gambling house

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,100
are really lame.

60
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,980
How dare you threaten Master Long?

61
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,660
Why are you getting so worked up?

62
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,300
Youlan.

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,540
Let him go.

64
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,660
Kid,

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,900
it seems you came prepared.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,540
How would I dare?

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,100
Master Long.

68
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,260
I did this

69
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,500
because I hope that the business
of Youlong Gambling House

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,640
will become more prosperous.

71
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,340
Tell me, what are your offers?

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,740
I can't tell you about what you
just asked.

73
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,300
Even if you tear down my gambling house,

74
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,500
I still can't tell you.

75
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,300
Master Long,

76
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,620
I heard that Master Du

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,820
is your sworn brother.

78
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,740
There are 300 rickshaw pullers
in Jiangzhou.

79
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,780
Each one is an informant.

80
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,180
Perhaps,

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,860
he might be willing to help

82
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,500
with the things you don't want
to reveal.

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,740
Don't worry, Master Long.

84
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,140
You won't suffer any loss.

85
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,860
Alright,

86
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,940
I can ask him

87
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
for you.

88
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,820
But I still advise you

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,380
not to waste your efforts.

90
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,780
After he left,

91
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,420
Master Long seemed to
have something on his mind.

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,900
I didn't dare to disturb him,

93
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,780
so I waited by the side.

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Then,

95
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,940
I...

96
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,420
(Maybe Huole didn't go home)

97
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
(because he went to find Master Du.)

98
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,940
(Obey orders. Perform duties
diligently.)

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,220
How is it going? Did she confess?

100
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
She said she killed the person,

101
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,540
but she didn't know why.

102
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,820
She didn't seem to be lying.

103
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
So I suspect

104
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
that someone might have used

105
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,380
datura or other poisons on her.

106
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,340
Is there any way to confirm it?

107
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,460
No problem.

108
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,180
Where is Huole?

109
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,820
I haven't seen him anywhere.

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,300
I've been looking for him too.

111
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,380
Mr. Juta, he is here.

112
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,740
Mr. Juta, it's Song He.

113
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm not blind.

114
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,020
Follow him and see where he goes.

115
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,260
(Master Du's villa)

116
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,260
Is Master Du here?

117
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,580
Hello?

118
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,340
Is anyone here?

119
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,700
Anyone?

120
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,020
Anyone?

121
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,140
Help.

122
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,700
Help.

123
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,060
Help.

124
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,700
Help.

125
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,580
Mr. Juta, Master Du is dead.

126
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,300
What did you say?

127
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,260
Master Du is dead?

128
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
It's absolutely true.

129
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,100
What about Abao?

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,140
Abao is seriously injured.

131
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,060
Song He has sent him
to Jiangzhou Hospital.

132
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,300
His life is saved,

133
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,340
but his legs are probably crippled.

134
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,540
Jiangzhou is not peaceful anymore.

135
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,100
Mr. Juta,

136
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,540
what should we do?

137
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,340
You guys keep watch here.

138
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll go to Du's Rickshaw Company.

139
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,340
Alright.

140
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,980
Let's go.

141
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,860
(Forensic Room)

142
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,700
Xiaofan,

143
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,740
have you found anything?

144
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,620
Nothing unusual with Youlan.

145
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,020
In such a short time,

146
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,460
if it was poison

147
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,700
or some hallucinogenic drugs,

148
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,820
I wouldn't have missed it.

149
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,620
She did something against her will,

150
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,780
lost memory of that period,

151
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,900
but didn't take any drugs.

152
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,300
If she wasn't lying,

153
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,340
then there must be some hidden truth.

154
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,860
Xiaofan, come with me to the hospital.

155
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,660
What happened?

156
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,580
Master Du of Du's Rickshaw Company

157
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,620
was the second person Qin Huole

158
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,700
visited yesterday.

159
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,300
He was also killed.

160
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Du Jingtian,

161
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,340
you better stop immediately.

162
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,420
Let go of me.

163
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,940
Officer Mao, right?

164
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,420
We're handling some family affairs.

165
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,060
Bear with us for a moment.

166
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,820
I didn't expect

167
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,740
that you actually did it.

168
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,300
(Abao, from Du's Rickshaw Company)
Though you're an illegitimate child,

169
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,340
our father didn't treat you badly.

170
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,020
You were so cruel to do it.

171
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,140
Brother, I didn't.

172
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,700
You hanged our father.

173
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,020
(Du Jingtian,)
How dare you call me brother?

174
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,200
(Young Master of Du's Rickshaw Company)
How dare you call me brother?

175
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,760
Brother, brother!

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,500
I didn't.

177
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,500
I...

178
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,780
Isn't this Captain Song?

179
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,860
Good that you know me.

180
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,540
Take your men

181
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,780
and get out of here.

182
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,300
This is Young Master Jingtian

183
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,220
of Du's Rickshaw Company.

184
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,340
Watch your words.

185
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,620
Otherwise, we

186
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,460
will teach you a lesson.

187
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,460
Come on.

188
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
Show me

189
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,980
how you will teach me a lesson.

190
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,020
I'll tell you one more time.

191
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,140
Get out of here immediately.

192
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,900
If you don't want to leave,

193
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,860
then stay here

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,340
and come with me to the police station.

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,780
I'll entertain you well.

196
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,660
Captain Song.

197
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,220
Don't be so angry.

198
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,940
We can leave.

199
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,580
But this little monster

200
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,860
hanged my father.

201
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,780
This is a father's murder.

202
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,700
I can't just let him go.

203
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,540
Captain Song, please save me.

204
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm not...

205
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm responsible for this case.

206
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,580
I will investigate it thoroughly

207
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,620
and give you an explanation.

208
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,380
Even if he is the murderer,

209
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,060
he will be punished by law,

210
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,940
but not you.

211
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,060
Your methods

212
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,380
won't work here.

213
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,620
Then what will work?

214
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,540
Young Master Jingtian,

215
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,420
we understand your feelings.

216
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,300
But bringing all these people

217
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,220
to block our investigation

218
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,620
won't help find the murderer

219
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,940
at all.

220
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,340
Miss Xiaofan,

221
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,620
I didn't see you were here too.

222
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,580
Alright,

223
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,700
today I will

224
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,540
do Miss Xiaofan a favor.

225
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,580
Song He,

226
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,660
give me a result as soon as possible.

227
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,620
Otherwise, I'll bring
300 rickshaw pullers

228
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
to the police station and kill this man.

229
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
I am a man

230
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,780
of my word.

231
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,540
Stop.

232
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,980
What's wrong?

233
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,340
First, Youlan killed Master Long.

234
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Now Abao is suspected

235
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,540
of killing Master Du.

236
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
These two murders

237
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,100
were both committed by close relatives.

238
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,100
I believe this is definitely
not a coincidence.

239
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,100
Now,

240
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,620
among the three tigers of Jiangzhou,

241
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,500
only the Great Master of Huanyinglou
is still alive.

242
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,940
If I were you,

243
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,060
I would go guard him now.

244
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,900
Young Master Jingtian,

245
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,500
are we just leaving like this?

246
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,060
Those police officers are unreliable.

247
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,340
Just take the mercy.

248
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,980
Isn't it just the police station?

249
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,460
What can happen if we go in?

250
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,580
Nonsense.

251
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,740
I don't care about the police station at all,

252
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,540
but that's Lei Hai's daughter.

253
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,300
If we don't leave, Lei's Army
will come to us.

254
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,660
You idiot.

255
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,580
You, leave two people
to follow Song He closely.

256
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,100
If there's anything, come to me
in Huanyinglou.

257
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,580
Okay.

258
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,820
What about me?

259
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,220
You?

260
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,900
Aren't you not afraid?

261
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,740
Stay here then.

262
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,220
I'll go with you to see Great Master.

263
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,500
Last night

264
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,020
when did Qin Huole arrive?

265
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,180
Around

266
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,620
eleven o'clock.

267
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,540
Why were there

268
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,940
only you and Master Du in the house?

269
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,780
Where were the others?

270
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,460
Master Du, he's my father.

271
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,540
He left the house to me and my mother.

272
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,980
A few years ago, my mother passed away.

273
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,340
So it was just me.

274
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,700
My father only came sometimes.

275
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,700
Captain Song.

276
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,660
You must seek justice for me.

277
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,060
How could I possibly kill my father?

278
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,420
I was born out of wedlock,

279
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,860
but he was my biological father.

280
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,700
Calm down.

281
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,700
I know.

282
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,220
This might not have been your intention.

283
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,460
Do you really believe me?

284
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,740
I just understand your situation.

285
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,620
If you want me to find out the truth,

286
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,500
you must recall everything clearly.

287
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,060
When Qin Huole saw your father,

288
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
what exactly did he say

289
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,580
and what did he do?

290
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
He

291
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,060
actually didn't

292
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,980
meet my father last night.

293
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,740
Last night...

294
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,020
Have some water.

295
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,500
Please sit for a moment.

296
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,500
Thank you.

297
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,660
Sorry to bother you so late.

298
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,780
Master Du hasn't slept yet, has he?

299
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,740
No, no.

300
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,140
When my mother was alive,

301
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,500
she didn't like visitors.

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,420
So my father

303
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,180
always received guests here.

304
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,020
Please sit.

305
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,220
I'll go get him right away.

306
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,420
Okay.

307
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,140
Abao.

308
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,900
And then?

309
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,460
Then it felt like

310
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,580
I had a dream.

311
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,540
When I woke up,

312
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,420
I found my father...

313
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,020
Father.

314
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,420
I killed him.

315
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,900
I killed him!

316
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,140
I killed my father.

317
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,260
I killed my father!

318
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
Father.

319
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,540
I killed my father.

320
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
I killed him!

321
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,060
I killed...

322
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,300
I really didn't know.

323
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,940
I didn't know why this happened.

324
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,780
I...

325
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,100
How could I kill...

326
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,180
- Watch him closely.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,420
I'm truly a monster.

328
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,260
I am worse than a monster.

329
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,780
I don't believe Huole did it.

330
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
He has no motive.

331
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,700
You trust him

332
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,400
as I do, right?

333
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,700
There are both witnesses and evidence.

334
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,820
I must report it to the station.

335
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,400
The station will immediately issue

336
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,340
a wanted notice for Qin Huole.

337
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,780
Have you thought about the consequences?

338
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,100
Once the wanted notice is issued,

339
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,300
Juta, Du Jingtian and others

340
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,580
will immediately turn to him.

341
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,100
If Huole falls into their hands,

342
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,100
he will lose his life.

343
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,220
If he can't even handle Du Jingtian

344
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
and Juta,

345
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,780
then what kind of detective is he?

346
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,900
He must be somewhere right now

347
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,740
trying to find out the truth.

348
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,820
We just need

349
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
to trust him.

350
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,100
You must remember.

351
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,820
I am a police officer.

352
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,340
Each of us

353
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,180
has our duties.
