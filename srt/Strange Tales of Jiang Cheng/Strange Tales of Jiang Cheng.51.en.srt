=Strange Tales of Jiangcheng=
=Episode 51=

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,300
If you don't admit it,

3
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,480
how could the people of Jiangzhou

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,250
hate you so much?

5
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,660
I finally understand.

6
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,810
You played a trick on me,

7
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,430
a heart-striking one.

8
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,270
Dad,

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,420
please stop.

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,340
I'm begging you.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,000
Qin Weilian,

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,300
it's not too late to turn back now.

13
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,520
One, two, three,

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,360
charge!

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,940
Listen up,

16
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,940
the reinforcements outside
are the Lei's Army.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,360
If I were you,

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,890
I would be thinking

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,780
about how to get out unscathed.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,890
Shut up!

21
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,390
Are you okay?

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,510
I have to be.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,830
Are you really going to shoot?

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,740
This is the armory.

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,150
Hurry up.

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,660
Soldiers from the Lei's Army,

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,970
attack!

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,410
Capture them alive.

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,620
Don't let a single one escape.

31
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,710
I realize that when we work together,

32
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,620
we have great synergy.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
I agree.

34
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,780
Count me in for the synergy.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,940
Preserve our strength. Retreat.

36
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
Retreat!

37
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,950
Chase them!

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,800
Father.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,150
- Commander.
- I deserve to die.

40
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,990
I arrive too late.

41
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,390
Father, leave the rest

42
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,900
to Huole and Song He.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,180
Why did you come back?

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,620
My family

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,410
and friends are here.

46
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,620
How could I leave in peace?

47
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,570
Honey,

48
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,130
Xiaofan is back,

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,940
but you can't see her.

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,530
I am the most reasonable person.

51
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,800
But I can't

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,100
even protect my own woman.

53
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,000
Report, Commander.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,660
Chen Biao is attacking the city now.

55
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,080
Our men have held them off for a while,

56
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,170
but their firepower is too strong.

57
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,190
We can't hold them back.

58
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,140
Commander, we need reinforcements!

59
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,260
Soldiers from the Lei's Army!

60
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Yes, sir!

61
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,290
Follow me into battle

62
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,580
and defend Jiangzhou!

63
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Yes, sir!

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Yes, sir!

65
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,430
Yes, sir!

66
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,190
Let's split up.

67
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
Even if

68
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,170
only one person survives,

69
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
I believe

70
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,700
you will carry on the spirit

71
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,100
- of the Night God Society.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,480
Uncle Fu, let's go.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Yes.

74
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,630
What are you planning to do?

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,360
Let's go together.

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,800
You go first.

77
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,990
I'll cover.

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,960
Take care.

79
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
What's wrong?

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,110
- Captain Song.
- Are you alright?

81
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,190
I'll carry you.

82
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,960
Good man.

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,930
Do what you need to do.

84
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,990
Alright.

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
Stay here and don't move.

86
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,990
We'll come back to get you.

87
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's go.

88
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,640
We'll split up. You go this way.

89
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,100
- What about you?
- I'll take the middle path.

90
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,290
- Be careful.
- Alright.

91
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,370
You are no match for me.

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
If you don't want to die,

93
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,900
get as far away as you can.

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,320
The police spared your life.

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,530
That's your fortune.

96
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,150
I don't believe in that.

97
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,050
The tougher the opponent,

98
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,780
the more excited I get.

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,850
Then die.

100
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,670
Uncle Fu,

101
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,650
Jushangfang is just ahead.

102
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,250
While they haven't caught up yet,

103
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,100
run for your life.

104
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,820
Master, what about you?

105
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,600
There is still one most important thing

106
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,490
waiting for me to do.

107
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,820
Since I cannot

108
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,420
become the ruler of Jiangzhou,

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,520
I will

110
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,320
become the one who destroys Jiangzhou.

111
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Master, though we failed this time,

112
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,540
there will be more chances.

113
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,970
We haven't failed yet.

114
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,000
Master.

115
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,000
Hurry and go.

116
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,120
Master,

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,460
take care.

118
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,770
You have failed.

119
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Just surrender.

120
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,220
Do you know what you are doing?

121
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,220
If you press that button,

122
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,940
the entire Jiangzhou will be flooded.

123
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,710
People will be displaced

124
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,680
and suffer.

125
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,130
A great reformer

126
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,850
is destined to endure criticism
and misunderstanding,

127
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,220
even from those closest to him.

128
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,770
One day,

129
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,460
you will understand everything I did.

130
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,640
So,

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,390
since the day I returned to Jiangzhou

132
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,650
and met you,

133
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,820
all of this has been a lie.

134
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,180
You pretended to be righteous

135
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,080
and claimed

136
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,540
that you would die for Miss Jiangyun,

137
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,010
but that was also a lie.

138
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,220
Chen Zou is your man.

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,100
Even if you pleaded guilty,

140
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,100
he would find a way to get you out.

141
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,730
Perhaps all of this

142
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,250
is part of your plan.

143
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
That's right.

144
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,340
Now Huole insists on investigating you,

145
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,700
it might affect your plan.

146
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,420
What will you do about this?

147
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,710
It can't

148
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,100
get Huole involved.

149
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,060
Let me think of a way.

150
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,540
In my plan,

151
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,000
I intended to use Miss Jiangyun

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,970
to fake my death.

153
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,130
This way, I could shed my identity

154
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,750
and completely hide myself away

155
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,090
to achieve the Night God Society's goals

156
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,850
step by step.

157
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,650
You are

158
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,540
the biggest surprise

159
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,130
in the entire plan.

160
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,100
Now when I look back,

161
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,730
I suddenly understand

162
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
why Che Jingwen

163
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,300
chose to end his life

164
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,510
so decisively

165
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,770
after meeting you.

166
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,610
This must also be you.

167
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,920
It was you

168
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,060
who extinguished his last hope

169
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,580
and cast a kind soul

170
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,580
into endless darkness.

171
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,060
Che Jingwen.

172
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,340
He wanted me to help him
with his lawsuit.

173
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,060
I wanted him to become a member
of the Night God Society.

174
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,820
He was too pedantic.

175
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,300
He couldn't understand

176
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,180
my thoughts.

177
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,760
Lawyer Qin,

178
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,220
if you were to bring down

179
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,460
someone much more powerful
than yourself,

180
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,370
what would you do?

181
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,190
It's simple.

182
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,000
Always be prepared

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,540
to sacrifice your own life.

184
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,770
So,

185
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,720
the only way

186
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,220
is to join the Night God Society.

187
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,000
Mr. Che,

188
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,240
to be honest,

189
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,150
I know everything

190
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,130
about you.

191
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,730
And in the entire Jiangzhou,

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,540
anyone who can contribute

193
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,460
will be recruited.

194
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,250
Didn't you say that the heavens
are unkind?

195
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,850
Didn't you hate this world?

196
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,510
We can help you

197
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,130
overturn everything.

198
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,190
Join me

199
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,100
and you will
see a truly beautiful Jiangzhou.

200
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,640
But

201
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,990
I still want to resolve this matter

202
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,320
through legal means.

203
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,300
Mr. Che.

204
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,250
I also want to tell you

205
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,890
that the justice you pursue

206
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,580
does not exist in this world.

207
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
How could it be?

208
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
A few days ago,

209
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,820
your son Huole just overturned the case
for you.

210
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,750
How do you know

211
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,890
that my son Huole

212
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,150
and his friends are not members

213
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,730
of the Night God Society?

214
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,540
How do you know

215
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,850
what means they used

216
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,700
to overturn the case for me?

217
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,850
You are truly cruel.

218
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,970
You can take a person's life
with only a few words.

219
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,280
Wrong!

220
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,420
I was telling him the truth.

221
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,970
He chose his own path.

222
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,040
Similarly,

223
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,850
although I look down on Huo Qingxin,

224
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,730
at least he knows which side to take.

225
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,120
He didn't understand my aspiration, either,

226
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,540
but he chose to believe in me.

227
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,590
So

228
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,920
he has always lived more freely

229
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,300
than Che Jingwen.

230
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,730
So who else did you choose?

231
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,160
Huanyang.

232
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,560
She meticulously

233
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,700
arranged all of this.

234
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,060
But the mastermind is also you, right?

235
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,180
Huole.

236
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
Your persistence

237
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,730
in getting to the bottom of things

238
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,010
is exactly like mine.

239
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,300
Huanyang is simply a singing girl.

240
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,590
Without my guidance,

241
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,970
how could she complete
such a complex design?

242
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,220
I helped her to achieve

243
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,730
the Night God's plan.

244
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,730
Do you really have a way to marry me
to Shenxing?

245
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,400
Lawyer Qin.

246
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,490
If I can't marry him in this life,

247
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,490
even in death

248
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,080
I won't rest in peace.

249
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,240
You're at the prime of your life.

250
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,490
How can you talk about that?

251
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,650
Actually, marrying into the Xu Residence

252
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,970
is not as difficult as you think.

253
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,350
Really?

254
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,850
Then what should I do

255
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,490
for you to tell me the method?

256
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,340
Well...

257
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,060
As long as you can help me,

258
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,180
you can ask me to do anything.

259
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Alright.

260
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,540
After you marry into the Xu Residence,

261
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,440
I hope you can keep an eye

262
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,490
on Xu Wuwen and his son.

263
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,770
When the time is right,

264
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,280
convince the father and the son

265
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
to join the Night God Society

266
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,750
and work together for the great cause.

267
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,700
Can you do that?

268
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,770
It's a deal.

269
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
Then listen carefully.

270
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,340
For you to marry into the Xu Residence,

271
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,580
Gu Sui

272
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,130
is a crucial person.

273
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,670
Unfortunately,

274
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,060
she only finished the first step.

275
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,820
Before she could take any action,

276
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,300
you have discovered her.

277
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
There was no choice.

278
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,540
I had to order her to be killed.

279
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,590
So,

280
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,340
after the plan was exposed,

281
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,730
you killed the assassin
who silenced Huanyang.

282
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,400
In an instant,

283
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,630
three more lives were lost.

284
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,490
If they didn't die,

285
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,580
those who entrusted their lives to me

286
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,610
would be in danger.

287
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,610
For the common ideal in our hearts,

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,300
I had no choice.

289
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,770
You did so much to win over Director Xu
and his son.

290
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,700
All you want is the guns and cannons
of the police station.

291
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,130
You wanted

292
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,460
to use the police force against the military,

293
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,120
didn't you?

294
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,310
I really should have recruited you

295
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,470
into the Night God Society earlier.

296
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,310
For real.

297
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,710
Maybe

298
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,010
we would have succeeded long ago.

299
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,350
No.

300
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,130
As long as I'm alive,

301
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,580
I will definitely

302
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,770
be the first person to stop you.
