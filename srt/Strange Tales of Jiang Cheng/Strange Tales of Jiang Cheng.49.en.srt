=Episode 49=

2
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,620
Mao

3
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,170
might not be coming back.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,360
Captain Song.

5
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,770
What should we do now?

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,100
Go to the hospital

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,100
and find Director Xu.

8
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,860
- Qingmang, you go.
- Yes.

9
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,950
Cheng Tianlang.

10
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,160
You go back to the police station

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,440
to bring me my medical kit.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,970
There are painkillers and antibiotics.

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,950
No problem.

14
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,870
Song He.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,890
What exactly happened

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,860
after I left?

17
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,460
(Wanted Notice. Qin Huole.)

18
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,870
Huole?

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
You...

20
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,810
Long time no see, Cheng Tianlang.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,450
How did you two end up together?

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,500
Today, I will kill you

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,100
to avenge my father.

24
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,230
Uncle Fu.

25
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,230
Uncle Fu.

26
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,500
- Uncle Fu!
- Stop!

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,500
Youlan, what are you doing?

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,670
He killed Master Long.

29
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,510
Shut up.

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,710
I don't want to explain to you.

31
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,010
- Get lost.
- You...

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,810
I'll say it only once.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,810
Just you wait.

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,510
Help me.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
Help me.

36
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,430
Miss Youlan?

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,250
Quick, help me untie the rope.

38
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,780
Hurry up, Jiangzhou is in big trouble.

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,990
What's the rush?

40
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,130
This is the fate of those
who break promises.

41
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,940
I must enjoy it for a while.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
I didn't forget.

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,520
But I couldn't contact you

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,410
while I was in prison.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,500
Prison?

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,060
What were you doing there?

47
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,060
It's a long story.

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,380
Untie me first

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,500
and let's get out of here.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,180
I see.

51
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll explain to you later.

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,140
Where is Song He?

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,380
Captain Song is in trouble.

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,900
Lawyer Qin

55
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,660
is Night God?

56
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,300
I know this sounds

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,220
very absurd.

58
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
I feel terrible too.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,700
But it's the truth.

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,220
After tonight's matter is resolved,

61
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,140
I will personally arrest him.

62
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,780
Huole.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,340
Qingmang.

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,300
Usually,

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,060
besides Zou Jing,

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,620
you've been with Commander Lei
the longest.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,140
Have you heard anything special

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,980
about what he plans to do

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,540
these days?

70
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,580
Something special?

71
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,580
Yes,

72
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,580
something

73
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,980
special.

74
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,580
Chen Biao's army is about
to reach Jiangzhou

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,340
Commander Lei has been working

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,180
on it recently.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,260
So

78
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,100
has he done anything to resist Chen Biao

79
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,300
and defend the city?

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,140
Just tell us quickly.

81
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,420
Juta.

82
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,500
What does it have to do with him?

83
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,820
I heard Zou Jing mentioned it
a couple of times.

84
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,620
Commander Lei was very happy

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,260
to have recruited Juta and his team.

86
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,460
My father just wanted to use them

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,300
as cannon fodder.

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,740
This way, fewer of his own soldiers

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,660
can die.

90
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,180
Because of this,

91
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,060
I even had a big fight with my father.

92
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,780
What does Commander Lei plan to do
with them?

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,700
He wanted them to form a team
of vanguards

94
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,100
to raid Chen Biao's stronghold.

95
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,660
He also promised that they could take
whatever they wanted

96
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,420
from the wealth he accumulated
over the years.

97
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,020
Did Commander Lei really say that?

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,180
At this point,

99
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,820
I won't hide it from you.

100
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,860
Shortly after Commander Lei
entered Jiangzhou,

101
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,300
he secretly dug an underground warehouse

102
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,420
under the Governor's Mansion.

103
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,820
There are

104
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,860
numerous guns and ammunition.

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,780
A team of vanguards is formed
by 20 people at most.

106
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,660
Even if each person takes double,

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,940
how much can they take?

108
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,380
Underground warehouse?

109
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,540
I see.

110
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,260
Look here.

111
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,660
This drainage channel passes through

112
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,740
most of the military areas in Jiangzhou.

113
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,140
Here is Jiangzhou Prison.

114
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,940
Here is the Governor's Mansion,
and here is the dike

115
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,420
located at the end of the channel.

116
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,940
Previously, to escape from the prison,

117
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,500
I discovered some newly installed
lanterns

118
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,580
in the drainage channel,

119
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,620
which indicates that someone
is using this place frequently.

120
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,620
The drainage channel

121
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,940
connects Jiangzhou Prison

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,700
and the Jushangfang Branch
near the dike.

123
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Then why doesn't it connect
the Governor's Mansion?

124
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,580
Because

125
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,520
that'd be easier to connect
to the underground warehouse.

126
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,540
That's right.

127
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,980
Once the underground warehouse

128
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,300
is connected to the drainage channel,

129
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,620
all of Commander Lei's possessions

130
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,900
might no longer belong
to the Lei's Army.

131
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,220
When the weapons change hands,

132
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,220
their next step is to get rid of
Commander Lei

133
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,460
and take control of the Lei's Army.

134
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,260
Then there will be no force left

135
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,500
that can rival them.

136
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,580
No way.

137
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,340
I need to return
to the Governor's Mansion right now

138
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,420
and tell my father.

139
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,980
Then I'll skin Zou Jing alive.

140
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,140
Stop.

141
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,220
You can't.

142
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,460
Why not?

143
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
If you do that,

144
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,940
they might fight to the death.

145
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,990
At that time, the situation will be
even more uncontrollable.

146
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,300
Then I'll call my father.

147
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,260
I'm afraid the entire Governor's Mansion

148
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,020
is already under Zou Jing's control.

149
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,620
No information can reach

150
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,580
Commander Lei's ears.

151
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,940
If you make that call,

152
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,620
Zou Jing will definitely be alerted.

153
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,300
At that time, tonight's operation

154
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,660
will be even harder.

155
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,020
What operation?

156
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,980
To stop them from controlling
the Lei's Army

157
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,740
and to completely destroy
the Night God Society.

158
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,900
Although Commander Lei

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,020
has stripped me of my authority,

160
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,900
I believe it wasn't his true intention.

161
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,180
It was Zou Jing who instigated it.

162
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,860
Now the situation is urgent.

163
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,100
Chen Biao's army is drawing near.

164
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,460
Jiangzhou cannot fall into chaos.

165
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,460
Huole,

166
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,940
what's your plan?

167
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,340
I'll do my best to cooperate with you.

168
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,460
If you need more force,

169
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,820
I

170
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
can still command a few.

171
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,380
Thank you, Director Xu.

172
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,860
With your support,

173
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,820
it will be much easier.

174
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,140
Alright, let's split into two groups.

175
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,060
Director Xu will personally command
one group

176
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,500
and bring all the police force

177
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,820
to the Jushangfang Branch

178
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,100
and capture Ma Xiaonian

179
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,860
before he blows up the dike.

180
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,820
Miss Youlan,

181
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,260
you are familiar with the city layout,

182
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,340
so please assist Director Xu

183
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,700
in completing this task.

184
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,820
Understood.

185
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,540
I know what you want to say.

186
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,180
Don't worry. I'm fine.

187
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,700
- Speak up.
- Okay.

188
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,500
The rest of us

189
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,300
will head straight
to the Governor's Mansion.

190
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,140
(Governor's Mansion)

191
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,460
How is it going?

192
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,180
Is the dynamite ready?

193
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,300
Everything is ready.

194
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,460
It took me a great effort

195
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,620
to obtain

196
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,540
this box of dynamite

197
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,460
in Ningcheng.

198
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,100
There is no extra stock left.

199
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,900
Don't you trust me?

200
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,220
The dike has been reinforced

201
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,300
multiple times to prevent floods.

202
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,260
If your dynamite isn't powerful enough,

203
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,620
it will be useless.

204
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,260
If you don't trust me,

205
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,980
you can find someone else.

206
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,460
Of course we trust you.

207
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,700
You were just a bit unlucky,

208
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,260
otherwise, the Jiangzhou Cotton Mill

209
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,700
would have been in ruins.

210
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,500
We don't fight battles we can't win,

211
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
nor do we hire unreliable people.

212
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,780
It's good that you trust me.

213
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,180
It's almost time.

214
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I'll head back to the prison
to finish the rest of the work.

215
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Remember

216
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,220
to detonate it

217
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,620
at 11 o'clock sharp.

218
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,300
Don't worry.

219
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,300
Everything will go smoothly.

220
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,660
You're in charge now.

221
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,860
I'm leaving.

222
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,820
Rest assured.

223
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,980
Be careful.

224
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,740
- Let's go.
- Okay.

225
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,660
Hold the lights steady.

226
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,300
Be careful not to detonate the dynamite.

227
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,940
At 11 o'clock,

228
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,140
the dynamite will explode on time.

229
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,980
By the way,

230
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,540
I also prepared

231
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,300
a plan B.

232
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,340
A pressure ignition device.

233
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,060
If you want to detonate it early,

234
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,100
press this.

235
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,380
You are really thoughtful.

236
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,820
Although we have different paths,

237
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,260
our goals are the same.

238
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,220
What if these two...

239
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,060
Don't worry.

240
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,140
I'll stay here

241
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,500
until two minutes before the explosion,

242
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,540
and then I'll evacuate

243
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,980
to ensure everything goes smoothly.

244
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,860
Good.

245
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,140
Huo,

246
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,620
after all, he's not one of us.

247
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,860
We must be on guard.

248
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,860
Don't worry.

249
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,620
Chen Zou has already made
his arrangements.

250
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,020
After the task is completed,

251
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,260
we'll send Ma Xiaonian to hell.

252
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,220
Let's go.

253
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,980
(Jushangfang)

254
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,340
Let's go.

255
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
What's this?

256
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,820
It's for entering
the Governor's Mansion.

257
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,460
I'm going back home.

258
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
Will they dare to stop me?

259
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
As I said before,

260
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,700
Zou Jing has been

261
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,740
a mole on Commander Lei's side

262
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,220
for so long without being discovered.

263
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,300
It shows that he is a very cautious person.

264
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,100
The key areas of the Governor's Mansion

265
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,900
must have already been replaced
with their people.

266
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,460
If we force our way in now,

267
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,300
it would be like walking into a trap.

268
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,860
So what should we do?

269
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,340
Hey.

270
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,860
We'll do it this way.

271
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,940
Director Xu,

272
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,300
you wait here first.

273
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,460
I'll go check the situation.

274
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Be very careful.

275
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,820
Yes, sir.

276
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,420
Wait.

277
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,060
Thank you.

278
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,660
(Governor's Mansion)

279
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,100
Quick!

280
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,340
Who's there? Stop!

281
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,580
Are you blind?

282
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,500
How dare you point a gun at me?

283
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,140
Miss,

284
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,260
why are

285
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,740
you here?

286
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,580
Didn't you leave Jiangzhou?

287
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,820
I leave when I want to leave

288
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,220
and come back when I want to.

289
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,660
Do I need to report to you?

290
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,860
I wouldn't dare.

291
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,300
- I...
- Then why are you still standing there?

292
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,820
Put your guns down!

293
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,460
Miss, at this time,

294
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,640
if Chen Biao's men

295
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,460
sneak into the Governor's Mansion
to harm the Commander,

296
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,380
it would be disastrous.

297
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,020
Lieutenant Zou has given strict orders.

298
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,900
No one is allowed to assess
without permission.

299
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,020
Violators will be shot.

300
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,820
Are you saying

301
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,540
I would bring Chen Biao's men

302
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
to harm my own father?

303
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,980
No, Miss, you...

304
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,500
That's not what I mean.

305
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,340
Shut up.

306
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Let me tell you.

307
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,420
These three

308
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,260
are Chen Biao's spies.

309
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,780
I caught them on the road.

310
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,860
Spies?

311
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
No more talking.

312
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,140
Miss Fan is clever to have found them.

313
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,900
Or they'd have infiltrated Jiangzhou.

314
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,060
These three are not small-time men.

315
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,020
I must personally hand them over
to my father.

316
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,020
Must...

317
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,620
Okay.

318
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,900
- Open the door.
- Move.

319
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,820
I...

320
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,020
To hell with you.

321
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,260
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

322
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,220
Behave yourself.

323
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,540
Are you done yet?

324
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,340
No, Miss.

325
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,900
That's not what I meant.

326
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,460
We should be cautious,

327
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,300
right?

328
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,220
Miss, please.

329
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,820
Move.

330
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,740
- Hurry.
- Hurry up.

331
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,900
