Episode 1

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first incident happened 25 years ago.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A man was arrested as a suspect.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Togashi Hiroki.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Who are you?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm a police officer.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Me too.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do you think your sister is alive?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Think again.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Even I'm so annoying,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm trying to help people who can't be separated.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If the guest is this man,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
please send me a message by saying it once.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's wrong?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Who is this woman?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Togashi-san,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have something to ask you.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Did you really kill her?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Call me if you need anything.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, come here.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Check it.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What time did you arrive?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
7 o'clock in the afternoon.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I went to find the old man in Abe.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
With Masaru Endo.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The old man?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Masaru sent him.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
When did you arrive?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I arrived about 10 minutes late.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I found the body and called the police station.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I got it.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's enough.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey,

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
did you find anything you can see?

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Nothing so far.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's your gender?

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I knew you were a woman.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I knew you were a woman.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to be clear from now on.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Same place.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
25 years ago.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come with me.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Bye.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey,

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
who is that body?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You don't know, do you?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Really?

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it your sister?

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you like me?

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You seem to be thinking about it.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm the only suspect in the case 25 years ago.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm interested in it.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's all?

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What else is there?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mr. Tansuo.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're here.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I brought some oranges.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I like you.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't be so hard on me.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You have a job at the store, don't you?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I can do that job because of you and the president.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to repay you.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you have time, why don't you go eat with Mio?

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is Mio not doing well?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She hasn't been home since yesterday.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She has to study for exams.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
At her friend's house.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That guy...

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We can't reach you on the phone.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Please message us.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mio,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you've been playing with your phone again, haven't you?

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Where are you?

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Call me.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The body found is a woman, but we don't know where it is.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The female mass murder team was found 25 years ago.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The case is still unresolved.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The police have established a special investigation headquarters.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We have also started an investigation into the case 25 years ago.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Stop it.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We have started an investigation.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The first suspect is Mr. Togashi.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Please take this.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Really?

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is that guy involved again?

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's going on?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's the site of the re-opening.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want to know.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's the police.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's a police officer.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The same place as 25 years ago, another murder case.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can't imagine it.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't imagine it.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The land will be sold.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I know that.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Please get the suspect and get your son's information.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We don't know where the body is yet.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've been doing a lot of things since I was a law-abiding.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But it will take time because there is no fingerprints.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No fingerprints?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My fingertips were cut off.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The same as 25 years ago.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Another murder case.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What? You're good.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Are you taking the medicine?

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm taking it.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Maybe the fingerprints were missing.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They disappeared at that time.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Kotone?

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So there was no murder for 25 years.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So that poster was not wrong.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stop it.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you doing?

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're a member of the police.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So get the suspect.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's impossible.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not the time to laugh.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you have a medical checkup within 8 months?

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not yet.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The victim was wearing these shoes.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They were released this year and sold out immediately.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They might be the victim's.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The shape of the shoes is the same as the heel.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I see.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The shoes are beautiful even though they are in a box.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think it's because the feet were in a plastic bag.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The inside of the bag was also beautiful.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Before putting it in, I cleaned the shoes.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What?

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I put the shoes in the bag after cleaning them.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I wrapped them tightly so that the dirt would not enter.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I wrapped them with a ribbon.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's like wrapping a present.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's all.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
How long do you work?

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
From 8 to 1.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard you work until 3.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sure you work until 1 at FUEHO.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I close at 1.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It takes time to clean up.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It takes 2 hours to clean up?

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There are women who preach.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They don't have to work.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're keeping your passport?

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What do you mean?

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Her passport.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not sure.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You don't have the right to do that.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Give it back to me.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Mr. Togashi!

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Mr. Togashi!

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If anything happens, please contact me again.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll see you again.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll see you again.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll see you again.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll see you again.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll see you again.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Please contact me again.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll see you again.

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you come to that kind of store often?

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Sometimes.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I come here for work.

176
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Work?

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Really?

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That girl was cute, right?

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She's a law abiding woman.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know that when I go there.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There are stores that hire law abiding women.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Can I leave you alone?

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Law abiding woman.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're lying.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's simple.

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,820
The

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Re-development project.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a project that raises the bar.

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought I should report it to the president.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's amazing.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can't measure the economic effect.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
A high-rise apartment in a shopping mall.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But I'm in trouble.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I see.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is the scene of the body discovery.

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We'd like to get the case over with as soon as possible.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How is the progress of the investigation?

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There are few foreign goods, so it seems to be in a difficult situation.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think so.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
With the help of the president,

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I hope that more money will be added to the project.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's what I heard.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're old friends.

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Stop it.

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was going to say hello to the police.

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's okay.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't come to my son's workplace.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm embarrassed.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a presidential election next year.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I want to sell my face.

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm your son, so please cooperate.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Eat this together.

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't accept this.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It could be a public election violation.

219
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're saying something hard.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you here for?

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm here to say hello to the president about the re-development project.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
With Nakabashi?

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't think you should get along with him.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why?

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I only hear bad rumors.

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
President!

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry to have made you a friend.

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's been a long time.

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you.

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The President's Office

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Choko!

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How long has it been?

235
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How are you?

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm fine.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're not going to talk to me?

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't have anything to talk to you about.

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I have an urgent report.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm your ex-husband.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I have a job.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is it about that case?

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's have dinner together.

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll call you again.

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You broke up so badly.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a divorce.

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't think so.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm still in love.

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You're investigating a case from 25 years ago.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I heard from Higurashi.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The case I was in charge of had a similar handle.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This time, the case is also similar.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is it a German criminal?

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think it's highly likely.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, don't go any further.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What's the matter?

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm a lawyer.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm going for you.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know where the hole is.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
For me, for yourself.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's about time to decide the next director.

263
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But it's too late.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Too late?

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I know who the found body is.

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If this man comes to the store, I'll give him a warning.

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Detective Otori.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I did it on my own.

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I used a woman who was illegal.

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
She suddenly disappeared.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Masato.

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You don't know your place.

273
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Listen.

274
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're a man who's in charge of the police's attention.

275
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Why are you involved in such a trivial case?

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There's something else you should do.

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is it a murder case?

278
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Leave it to the people at the scene.

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They're professionals.

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It may be.

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I couldn't do it.

282
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's illegal.

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because it's illegal, the case was resolved without any action.

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The victim's sister is still unknown.

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
She's not related to you.

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't do anything.

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Be quiet.

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If you find out who the woman is, you're done.

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This is an order.

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Detective Yashiro.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's been eight months.

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know the origin yet, but I'm sure it's not Kotone.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The killer from 25 years ago appeared again?

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's a fraud.

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I saw the old article.

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's not true.

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why?

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Even the report was the same.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's been a long time since the killer appeared again.

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's been 25 years.

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The other day?

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe the body didn't come out and didn't notice.

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Then there's another victim in the missing person.

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Asaru.

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's not decided.

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's the victim's sister.

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
First, we have to find out the victim's sister.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The case from 25 years ago?

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Togashi's sister and Abe Kaori's case.

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I want to see the investigation materials.

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why?

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't think it's necessary to explain to the chief of police.

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Thank you.

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank you.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What do you mean?

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not in the database.

322
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's an old case.

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a new case to be on the database.

324
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know.

325
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Is that okay?

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't say that.

327
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I came here two years ago.

328
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know anything about it.

329
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Please go upstairs.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
How is it?

331
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Is it similar?

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hello.

333
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello.

334
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm Togashi, the head of the Ibaraki Prefecture Police Department.

335
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You know me, right?

336
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You've been investigating me before.

337
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was working here with Inspector Yashiro.

338
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What if I did?

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What did Inspector Yashiro investigate specifically?

340
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want you to tell me.

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know?

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's right.

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're in trouble, aren't you?

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're holding a debt.

345
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You'll get into illegal work.

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It was a matter of investigation.

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's okay.

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Please.

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What were you investigating?

350
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The Kuma Prefecture Police Department.

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I was working with the Saitama Prefecture Police Department to investigate the illegal case.

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The case of a woman who had been in prison for two or three years has continued.

353
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Prison?

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
All the victims worked at the prison.

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And everyone...

356
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Was your finger cut?

357
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Was it cut?

358
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes.

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It was the same as the case 25 years ago.

360
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So you made eye contact with me.

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But I suddenly applied for a transfer.

362
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Iida failed.

363
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I left the investigation and chased you alone.

364
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

365
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No.

366
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The police wouldn't do that.

367
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Hey.

368
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Hey.

369
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey!

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey!

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Hiroyuki.

372
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm going to eat rakkase.

373
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Rakkase? What's wrong with you?

374
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I got it from a customer.

375
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It'll be a drink snack.

376
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Thank you.

377
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, Mio.

378
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You're not back yet?

379
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Where is he? What is he doing?

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Mio?

381
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hello?

382
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What is this?

383
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Find out where the store is.

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Over there.

385
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Over there.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Hey.

389
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Did you see him?

390
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I was waiting for him.

391
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you.

392
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Hey!

393
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What?

394
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey.

395
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Get out of here.

396
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What?

397
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Don't mess with me.

398
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Give it back.

399
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm going to kill you!

400
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Do you want to get beaten up?

401
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Get out!

402
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What did you do to her?

403
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I didn't do anything!

404
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I drank tequila and got beaten up!

405
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't drink until you're beaten up.

406
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Get out.

407
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Mio.

408
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Get up.

409
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We're going home.

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What?

411
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What?

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's go.

413
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What?

414
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's go.

415
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Mio.

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Get up.

417
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What?

419
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are you okay?

420
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm fine.

421
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm fine.

422
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you okay?

423
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You haven't been home for a day.

424
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Were you drinking with them all day?

425
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You look so tired.

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't want to go home.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Dad will get mad at me.

429
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Dad will get mad at you?

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I won't yell at you.

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't want to hear you say that.

432
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't want that.

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Let's get ready and go home.

434
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Good morning.

435
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Good morning.

436
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Excuse me.

437
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Can I ask you a question?

438
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What's the relationship between Togashi and Mio?

448
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
They've been together since they were kids.

449
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They're like daughters.

450
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Mio left with Yanagi when she was little because her mother didn't get along with her.

451
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So sometimes Togashi took her place and went to the class.

452
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I see.

453
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Togashi and Yanagi were childhood friends.

454
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yanagi and her parents were watching the same time.

455
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I see.

456
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Good morning.

457
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Good morning.

458
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Good morning.

459
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I heard there was a movement in the Hokkaido case.

460
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I heard there was a movement.

461
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
A man arrested for murdering his wife in Sapporo was released this morning.

462
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The police arrested him for not finding the body and only finding evidence.

463
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But the investigation ended in a draw.

464
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I wonder how many people will be killed.

465
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
He's definitely doing it.

466
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I feel sorry for the woman who was killed.

467
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I agree.

468
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't know if she was killed.

469
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
There was a lot of blood in the house.

470
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But it's not limited to the one who was killed.

471
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There's a motive for it.

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Evidence of the situation.

473
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's hard to get a record if the body isn't found.

474
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's just evidence of the situation.

475
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Right, Tokyo University Law School?

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's hard to get a record.

477
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The murder case without the body will be sent to the police as long as nothing happens.

478
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If the body isn't found, it's a matchmaking.

479
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The man who was arrested for murdering his wife in Sapporo was released this morning.

481
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's...

482
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
What's this?

483
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The murder case without the body.

484
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Two cases of murder with a cut finger.

485
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Two murder cases with a cut finger.

486
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The same place as 25 years ago.

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Another murder case.

488
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The murder case without the body.

489
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The murder case without the body.

490
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Hello?

491
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Where are you?

492
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Near the house.

493
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I left the key in the bathroom.

494
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
What are you going to do?

495
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm going to go in from the back.

496
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Really?

497
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
See you.

498
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Hey.

499
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Huh?

500
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I saw it.

501
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What?

502
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The basement.

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
There are a lot of photos and documents of the murder.

504
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Don't tell anyone.

505
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Huh?

506
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's a secret between you and me.

508
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I see.

509
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Let's go.

510
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What?

511
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Is there something else?

512
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
No.

513
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Be careful on your way home.

514
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The murder case without the body.

515
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The murder case without the body.

516
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The murder case without the body.

517
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The murder case without the body.

518
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The murder case without the body.

519
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The murder case without the body.

520
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You're late.

521
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Thank you.

522
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Thank you.

523
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You're good at this.

524
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I always do it.

525
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I want to make my daughter eat delicious meat.

526
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's a good idea.

527
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Isn't it a little too sweet?

528
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Because it's a parent and child of two.

529
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Mio loves yakiniku.

530
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Thank you for waiting.

531
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's coming.

532
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It looks delicious.

533
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Please give me a little oil.

534
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, yeah.

535
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's delicious.

537
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Don't eat it.

538
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yanagi.

539
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm fine here, so take the meat home.

540
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Mio is waiting.

541
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You can call me here.

542
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm busy studying for the exam.

543
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Stand where everyone is.

544
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Four days ago, I found a body in my foot.

545
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't know his name or age.

546
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's a body that's unknown.

547
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But one thing is certain.

548
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Before he died, the police were not there.

549
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'll catch the culprit so that the same thing never happens again.

550
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'll catch the culprit so that the same thing never happens again.

551
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'll catch the culprit.

552
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll give you a wooden sword for the victim.

553
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Wooden sword.

554
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
All right, put it on the glass.

555
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you have money?

556
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
No.

557
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Are you healthy?

558
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
No.

559
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Do you have a purpose in life?

560
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
No.

561
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Then catch it.

562
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Let's catch it.

563
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Thank you.

564
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Please grill the meat.

565
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yes.

566
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I brought the fish.

567
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You're late.

569
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I was walking in Yosama City.

570
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Do you want a drink?

571
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't feel like that.

572
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What are you doing here?

573
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Stop me.

574
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Why?

575
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's okay.

576
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You used to stop me a lot.

577
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's okay to be in a room close to you.

578
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let's go home.

579
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Are you okay?

580
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What?

581
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I was in a bad mood.

582
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Did something happen?

583
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Nothing.

584
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Kotone's case was closed.

585
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The same as Kaori's case.

586
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Is it you?

587
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Why do you think so?

588
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Tell me the truth.

589
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't know.

590
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Please go home.

591
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yashiro realized that the materials were gone.

592
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Bye.

593
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sorry.

594
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Kotone.

595
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What are you doing there?

596
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm going to learn the geography of the canals.

597
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm going around here.

598
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Then I'll show you around.

599
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's okay.

600
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't want to bother you.

601
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I can do it myself.

602
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's okay.

603
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Come on.

604
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Put the car there.

605
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The police say you earn money by your feet.

606
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'll show you around.

607
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Turn right and you'll see the BBQ restaurant.

608
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's Shoda.

609
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Go to the left and you'll see the city hall.

610
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Is there any good property around here?

611
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Property?

612
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm thinking of moving here.

613
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You'll be back in Tokyo soon.

614
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm going to the city hall.

615
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm going to the city hall.

616
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm going to the city hall.

617
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You'll be back in Tokyo soon.

618
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's no use.

619
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I want to live here.

620
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
In this city.

621
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Isn't it near your house?

622
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Do you like me that much?

623
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You're not a police officer.

624
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You're a suspect.

625
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You're a suspect.

626
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What do you like about me?

627
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm not the only one who's been locked up.

628
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You want to know what I was doing in the Tojii Genki, right?

629
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What's wrong?

630
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm going to the city hall.

631
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm going to the city hall.

632
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm going to the city hall.

633
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm going to the city hall.

634
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm going to the city hall.

635
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm going to the city hall.

636
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm going to the city hall.

637
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm going to the city hall.

638
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm going to the city hall.

639
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm going to the city hall.

640
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm going to the city hall.

641
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm going to the city hall.

642
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm going to the city hall.

643
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm going to the city hall.

644
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm going to the city hall.

645
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I'm going to the city hall.

646
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
No...

647
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yes!

648

Zombie

651
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,500
You've got no choice but to turn to a monster to catch a monster.

652
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,800
That's because you found your finger.

653
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,500
Will a�� there be anything you can do to bring the Taiwanese police to attention?

654
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,760
I must be forgiven.

655
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,800
That's just sighing.

656
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,500
