1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's the same place as 25 years ago.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Don't do anything.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Just stay quiet.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How is the progress of the investigation going?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I saw it. The basement.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's no one's business.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,040
I like putting my hand up so it looks as if they tane the fridge

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,020
ش

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,460
Jump to drive

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,480
How many american

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,360
I came home

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,980
yeah

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,540
About 7 o

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,300
at

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Don't scare me.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Where were you?

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
At my friend's.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Was that the last thing you saw?

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Yes.

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,040
There was a delivery at Rinko's shop.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
What happened after that?

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
It was past 11.

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Mio.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Do you know where he went?

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
He went to the store.

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Do you know where he went?

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,040
I don't know anything about this.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Mio...

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Was he killed?

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
I don't know yet.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
He's the only son.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,040
There was another dangerous case that could bring the world to its knees.

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
The other day, a woman was found dead.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,040
The woman was found dead at the Ibaraki Prefecture.

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,040
The place where the 10 fingerprints were found was at the store of the liquor shop run by Satsuo Yanagi.

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,040
The two people who discovered the body were the two people from the Gensotsu Police Station.

37
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
The victim is the daughter of Satsuo Yanagi.

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
She is still missing.

39
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
The witness information is still fresh.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,040
The Ibaraki Prefecture has sent a special investigation report to the Hata Noh Show.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
I'm Imamura from KTC TV.

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Did you find the victim's body?

43
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Hahaha...

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Was this vender the body?

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Yes.

46
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I made a check, but the blood was still attached.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Was there anything gotten to him?

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Tee-hee, mm, we found him dead.

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
He f oftentimes sauce while sleeping and remains in a dilated state.

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Someone must have technical issues behind him.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Huh?

52
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,140
You want me to take my seat?

53
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,640
Yeah. Just a little.

54
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,640
What's in that bag?

55
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,840
Nothing.

56
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,640
None of your business.

57
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,340
We're friends, right?

58
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,140
No, don't pull.

59
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,340
Don't ask. Get out.

60
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,440
What's wrong with you? You've been acting strange lately.

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,840
Hey, Togashi.

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,340
Do you know something?

63
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,740
What do you mean?

64
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,840
Do you think I killed myself?

65
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,740
Clothes

66
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,040
What's in that bag, Togashi?

67
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Le election

68
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,040
Did something come out?

69
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,520
Stop at the shop.

70
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,920
limited hours for customers and businesses.

71
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,520
Even if the footprints or DNA are found, it takes time to determine the person.

72
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,520
What about the fingerprints?

73
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,720
The fingerprints are the same as Mio's.

74
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:14,360
I asked the

75
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
police.

76
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,120
What do you mean?

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,920
Shouldn't you be out of the way?

78
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,920
Why?

79
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,520
I'm explaining the incident to the witness.

80
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,920
I had a conversation with the victim.

81
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,120
It's illegal to interfere with the investigation.

82
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,120
Why?

83
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,520
What?

84
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,820
What's wrong with a detective interfering with the investigation?

85
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,820
Is it wrong to catch a person who hurt a family member like a family member?

86
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
I can't talk to you.

87
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,820
May I start?

88
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
I'd like to refer to you.

89
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,020
Please.

90
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Detective Togashi.

91
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,420
On October 6, I saw Mr. Miyo Yanagi for the last time.

92
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,620
When I brought him home,

93
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,220
it was a little before 8 o'clock.

94
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
After that, it was night and I was getting ready to go home.

95
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,820
When I got home, Mio had forgotten his key, so I called him.

96
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
At 7 o'clock in the afternoon.

97
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
That was the last time.

98
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,420
Who is the person who hid it?

99
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,220
After that, I went to the yakiniku restaurant.

100
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
What time did you go home?

101
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,820
11 o'clock.

102
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,220
There is no alibi after 11 o'clock.

103
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,820
I went home and slept.

104
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,020
The person who proves the alibi until 11 o'clock is in charge of the investigation.

105
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
Besides, you two are high school classmates, right?

106
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,020
If you don't like me, there are others.

107
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Are they good friends like family?

108
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,620
Can't you trust the victim's father and the police?

109
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,220
I understand.

110
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,620
It's okay.

111
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm a police officer and a detective, so I have a reasonable doubt.

112
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
A reasonable doubt?

113
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,420
Don't you think it's strange?

114
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,420
The same incident happened 25 years ago.

115
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
The case of Ashiwara and this case.

116
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:26,420
And for some reason, the first discoverer is the only suspect 25 years ago.

117
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
What's your story?

118
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Is reasonable doubt only applied to me?

119
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Are you serious? I was 3 years old 25 years ago.

120
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
It used to be different, but now I'm 28 years old.

121
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Isn't it a secret?

122
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Teguchi didn't leak to the outside world.

123
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,420
He didn't leak to the outside world, but you're an inside person.

124
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Besides, your father is the number two in the police department.

125
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
If you want to know, you can look into it.

126
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,420
This case is a fraud, and the fraud is me.

127
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
I'm not the only one who discovered the first.

128
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,420
You're the same.

129
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,420
Ashiwara Game.

130
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,420
I thought it was just a substitute, but it's pretty good.

131
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
It's not a joke.

132
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm trying to make the culprit.

133
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
So what are you going to do?

134
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Please secure the security camera.

135
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Security camera?

136
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
It's a video of the inside of the room and the hallway.

137
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
Why?

138
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm going to catch Togashi Hiroaki in a reasonable way.

139
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I'm going to catch him.

140
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
I wonder if he's really the culprit.

141
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
I think so.

142
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
I'm going to catch him.

143
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I'm going to catch him.

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
I'm going to catch him.

145
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
I'm going to catch him.

146
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I'm going to catch him.

147
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
I'm going to catch him.

148
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,420
I'm going to catch him.

149
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
I'm going to catch him.

150
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm going to catch him.

151
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
I'm going to catch him.

152
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
I'm going to catch him.

153
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
I'm going to catch him.

154
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
I'm going to catch him.

155
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm going to catch him.

156
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm going to catch him.

157
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm going to catch him.

158
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I'm going to catch him.

159
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I'm going to catch him.

160
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
I'm going to catch him.

161
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
I'm going to catch him.

162
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
I'm going to catch him.

163
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
I'm going to catch him.

164
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
I'm going to catch him.

165
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,420
I'm going to catch him.

166
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
I'm going to catch him.

167
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
I'm going to catch him.

168
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm going to catch him.

169
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm going to catch him.

170
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm going to catch him.

171
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
I'm going to catch him.

172
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
I'm going to catch him.

173
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm going to catch him.

174
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
I'm going to catch him.

175
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
The seems department chief must be free now,

176
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,420
but is it okay?

177
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
An incident happened...

178
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,420
but the police chief is still in this situation.

179
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,420
Yanagi asked us to do something.

180
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,420
I asked him to come and see you.

181
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
What about Tatsuo?

182
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,420
He's running a restaurant, but he can't get a job.

183
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
I guess so.

184
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,420
This is the lunchbox Rinko made for me.

186
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,420
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

187
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
I'll eat later.

188
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Eat now.

189
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
Eat before it gets cold.

190
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
I don't feel like eating.

191
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Hey, you look pale.

192
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
You have a dark circles.

193
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,420
You may hear this, but you can't live if you're alive.

194
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Kotone...

195
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
What?

196
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
I wonder if she's alive.

197
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
What's wrong, Togashi?

198
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,420
Last year, I went to Kotone's house.

199
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,400
I saw the

200
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
new manager.

201
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
He was working at the time.

202
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
He looked like him.

203
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
What do you think?

204
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
He looked like a finger.

205
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Kotone doesn't have a finger.

206
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
He's not 20.

207
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,420
He's 45 now.

208
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,420
But he'll know if he's in town.

209
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
He's not a man.

210
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,420
How many women in the world have no fingers?

211
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
But in these 25 years,

212
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,420
there's no one who saw a finger.

213
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Kotone...

214
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
died.

215
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
You think he died, too, right?

216
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,420
That's why...

217
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Did something happen?

218
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
It was the first word.

219
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
He wasn't found.

220
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,420
It was like he was convinced he was dead.

221
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
He died.

222
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
He's not found.

223
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Why?

224
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Because he has no chance to return it.

225
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,420
He has no chance to return it.

226
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Who?

227
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Who?

228
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Kotone.

229
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Kotone.

230
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Kotone.

231
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,420
It was like he knew the culprit.

232
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
He's strange.

233
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
He's probably dreaming.

234
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
I hope it's a dream.

235
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Are you suspecting Togashi?

236
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
Yes, I am.

237
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
As a detective.

238
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,420
You have to suspect your old friend.

239
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
It's a bad job.

240
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,420
What about you?

241
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I believe in Togashi.

242
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
I believe in Togashi.

243
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
I've been curious about something.

244
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
For 25 years.

245
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
25 years?

246
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
At that time...

247
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Get on.

248
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
I believed in Togashi's innocence.

249
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Even if I was arrested and stabbed in the back,

250
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Togashi Hiroyuki wasn't like that.

251
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,420
But...

252
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
What about you?

253
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm the same.

254
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Then why didn't you go to the police?

255
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,420
You proved Togashi's innocence.

256
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
You didn't say that right away.

257
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Is there anyone who can prove it?

258
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Togashi.

259
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Why?

260
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
No...

261
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
I don't remember.

262
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
You don't remember?

263
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Well...

264
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
It was clear.

265
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
I was in a bad condition.

266
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Anyway...

267
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
I'm the same as Shoko.

268
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,420
I still believe in Togashi.

269
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
Sobia.

270
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
If the guest is this man,

271
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,420
send him a message.

272
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
There's a tracking app.

273
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
What?

274
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,420
I know you're a criminal.

275
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
Are you okay?

277
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,420
Did something come out?

278
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
No.

279
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,420
The case is over.

280
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,420
I understand.

281
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,420
What happened?

282
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
What happened?

283
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
What's the matter?

284
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Cringing in...

285
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,420
She's running away from home.

286
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Frau Scaeckel,ん

287
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Is there a grudge against the security camera?

289
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Please open it.

290
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
What's wrong?

291
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Kotone's files are back.

292
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
What do you mean?

293
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Did Togashi return them?

294
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,420
They were in the files of other incidents.

295
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
I'm sorry.

297
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
I'm sorry.

299
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I found them and returned them.

303
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
And the documents of Kaori Abe.

304
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,420
They were also in other things.

305
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I'm glad.

306
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,420
Now I can investigate without any worries.

307
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
I see.

308
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,420
I wonder why I couldn't think of something.

309
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
A grudge.

310
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Are Togashi and Tadokoro a grudge?

311
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Didn't Tadokoro delete the footage of the security camera?

312
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
You're funny.

314
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Listen.

315
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,420
This is a police station in the countryside.

316
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,420
It's not unusual that the documents are lost and the security camera is not working.

317
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
Nobody cares about that.

318
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
A break?

319
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
You should have a break.

320
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Take a rest.

321
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Why?

322
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
You have a job.

323
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Mio, you're in trouble.

324
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
It's okay.

325
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
I can't rest at this time.

326
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
I'll arrest the culprit.

327
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
What are you talking about?

328
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
You're a security guard.

329
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
You're in charge.

330
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Of course I know.

331
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I'll do it on my own.

332
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
I can't leave it to the investigation department.

333
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Stop it.

334
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
It's just a problem.

335
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
I won't bother the chief.

336
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,420
You need to be prepared for this kind of case.

337
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
Prepare?

338
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,420
You won't be able to handle the investigation without evidence.

339
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,420
If you find the culprit, you'll be beaten up and then you'll be arrested.

340
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
You need to be prepared.

341
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,420
It was the same 25 years ago.

342
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
I know the best about the investor.

343
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
I won't make excuses.

344
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
Don't forgive me.

345
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
Of course.

346
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
I won't forgive you.

347
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,420
It's a joke.

348
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
I was young at that time.

349
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
The times have changed.

350
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
Now...

351
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
Nothing has changed.

352
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,420
It's the same old times.

353
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,420
You can solve a case without evidence.

354
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
But you have to confess.

355
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
No matter what kind of hand you use.

356
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,420
You have to be a monster to catch a monster.

357
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,420
You say it often.

359
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
The culprit returns to the crime scene.

360
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,420
What's that?

361
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
I'll see.

362
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
It's not about that. It's a 25-year-old case file.

363
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
You returned it.

364
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
What do you mean?

365
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
If the file is back, that's fine.

366
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
It is a theft of the operating file.

367
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
It is a compensation for the investigation.

368
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
What's the evidence that I did?

369
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
The image of the security camera.

370
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
You deleted it, right?

371
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,420
Was it you?

372
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Was it Tadokoro?

373
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
I don't know.

374
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
What do you mean?

375
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Hiroyuki.

376
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Is there any progress in the investigation?

377
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
I'm sorry.

378
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,420
If you know anything,

379
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
tell me.

380
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
You're very cold.

381
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
I see.

382
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,420
You're a childhood friend.

383
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
I don't like it.

384
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,420
Are you nervous?

385
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
Yes?

386
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
It's Endo.

387
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Come back to the office.

388
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
What's the first time you came to Hatano?

389
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,420
I came here on October 1.

390
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Have you ever been here before?

391
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
When I was two or three years old,

392
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,420
my father was the director of this place.

393
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
I don't remember.

394
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
What happened after that?

395
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Nothing.

396
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Do you know the victim, Miyo Yanagi?

397
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
No.

398
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,420
But I've seen it.

399
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
The day before the incident.

400
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
It happened by chance.

401
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,420
You've never met before?

402
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,420
Yes.

403
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Why is that?

404
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,420
A police officer who was following Miyo's scent

405
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
found something.

406
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,420
I wonder if you know.

407
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,420
There's no phone call history on the phone.

408
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,420
There are three e-mails.

409
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,420
All the e-mails I sent from Miyo's smelly cell phone

410
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,420
were all about you.

411
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Do you really not know Miyo?

412
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
I don't know.

413
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Then whose phone is this?

414
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
It might have been a mail that was delivered by accident.

415
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Accident, huh?

416
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
And an accident.

417
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,420
How long ago was Masato's family teacher?

418
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
12 years ago.

419
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,420
It seems you haven't seen him for 12 years

420
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,420
and you still don't know about him.

421
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,420
He's overestimating his own intelligence.

422
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,420
He's been working hard to make a living.

423
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Did you get DNA?

424
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I'm looking into the virtual world.

425
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
I see.

426
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,420
You've done a good job with the last case of the increase in the number of cases.

427
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,420
Yes, thanks to the director, I was able to start working right away.

428
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
Thank you very much.

429
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
It's good to continue working as it is,

430
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,420
but if you want to go higher, you need a lot of experience.

431
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
I need your help.

432
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,420
The director of the Tokyo City Special Investigation Department

433
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,420
is my junior, but he wanted a new person.

434
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,420
If you want that, I'll recommend him.

435
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Please, the special investigation department.

436
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
If anything comes up in the virtual world,

437
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
please contact me immediately.

438
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Yes.

439
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
I'll be off.

440
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,420
It's been a quiet town for 25 years.

441
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
The sponsor is stepping on the foot of the tree.

442
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,420
It's a different story.

443
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
It's a town without crime.

444
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,420
It's a bad thing if it's like this.

445
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
But what should I do?

446
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,420
The police are under investigation.

447
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,420
Then we'll catch the culprit.

448
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,420
Don't mess with me.

449
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,420
Anyway, we have to connect the sponsor company.

450
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
How?

451
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,420
The police are cooperating with our plan.

452
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
I think they're doing it.

453
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
Are you asking the director again?

454
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
There's a big one.

455
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
We used to be friends.

456
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,420
The director of the Tokyo City Special Investigation Department

457
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
I don't want you to call me when you're busy.

458
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
What's with that tone?

459
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
It's about that cell phone.

460
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,420
The results of the virtual world were found.

461
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,420
I contacted you before I crossed the police.

462
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Can I do that?

463
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
You really can't?

464
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,420
You should hand it over to the police.

465
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,420
You don't have to do anything.

466
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
There's a fire in the dust.

467
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Last week, the woman you found in Asihara was dead.

468
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,420
The DNA came out of the cell phone.

469
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,420
What do you mean?

470
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
I don't know.

471
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,420
What?

472
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,420
There's nothing else about me.

473
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
If you ask me.

474
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:43,420
If your team knew that you were investigating the case of the prison,

475
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,420
you'd know where the woman is.

476
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,420
It's illegal.

477
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,420
You can't know where she is.

478
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,420
I don't have any evidence to prove my relationship with you.

479
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,420
It's all speculation.

480
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,420
What if the press turns on the news?

481
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
What do you think will happen?

482
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
What do you think will happen?

483
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,420
What can you do?

484
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,420
I told you before I entered the police station.

485
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,420
From now on, I won't lend you a hand.

486
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

487
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
What do you think?

488
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Give me your position.

489
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

490
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

491
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

492
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

493
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

494
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

495
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

496
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

497
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

498
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

499
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

500
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

501
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

502
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
I'll do it with my own ability.

503
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,420
Mr. Toka.

504
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,420
I heard.

505
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,420
What?

506
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,420
From the cell phone found in Ashibikiyama,

507
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Yashiro's number appeared.

508
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Not only the number,

509
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,420
but also the DNA of the body found in Ashihara.

510
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,420
It seems that it came out of the cell phone.

511
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,420
What does that mean?

512
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
I'm being suspected.

513
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,420
Of course, I don't remember the body.

514
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
That's why,

515
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
I'm going to take a break

516
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:19,600
until the

517
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
next meeting.

518
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,420
Yashiro.

519
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,420
Thank you for your hard work.

520
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
Did you laugh?

521
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
What?

522
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Now,

523
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,420
you laughed.

524
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,420
I'm glad the obstacles are gone.

525
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Now, I can do what I like.

526
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
What do you mean?

527
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,420
I won't disappear.

528
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
I will definitely catch you.

529
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
I'm going to take a break.

530
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
It seems that you are tired.

531
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
Please take a rest.

532
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
I'll do it when I have to.

533
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,420
Are you sure?

534
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
It's on the security camera.

535
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,420
I'll go.

536
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll go.

537
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,420
I'll go.

538
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
I'll go.

539
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
I'll go.

540
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
I'll go.

541
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
I'll go.

542
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
I'll go.

543
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
I'll go.

544
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420
I'll go.

545
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
I'll go.

546
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
I'll go.

547
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
I'll go.

548
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,420
I'll go.

549
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
I'll go.

550
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,420
Excuse me.

551
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Can I ask you something?

552
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
Is there a security camera around here?

553
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Is there a security camera?

554
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Is there a security camera?

555
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Is there a security camera?
