00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Damn it.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,000
Where did he hide it?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,400
We have to catch him and make him talk.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,600
He's doing it again.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,800
He said it's bad.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Look.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Do you...

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,000
trust the guys above us?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
That's why...

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,400
there's no evidence to prove that he was a illegal criminal.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,800
Once he's innocent, he'll never be able to go to jail again.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
I'll leave it to you.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
I'll use scissors.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,200
I'll go around.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,600
You stay here.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,800
Wait.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Togayashi-san.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,060
Deputy Chief of Police, Hamakami

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
Togayashi-san.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
We can leave...

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,800
now.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can't catch you.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Togashi.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Togashi!

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wake up.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It looks like you got away.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Togashi!

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you listening?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Togashi!

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, I can't.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Togashi!

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's wrong?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yanagi.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is it?

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Togashi!

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't surprise me.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where were you?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
At my friend's.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What about dinner?

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't want it.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hello?

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Where are you?

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm at home.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're at the restaurant.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Shut up!

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come here.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Everyone's here.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I see.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll be there.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Togashi.

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Togashi.

53
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, Piko.

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I ran out of beer.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Morihira and the others are here.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Can I go with you?

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

58
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll take you.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay.

60
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you asleep?

61
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hello?

62
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Togashi.

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Togashi.

64
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Togashi.

65
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Togashi.

66
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hello?

67
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hello?

68
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Togashi.

69
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Miyo!

70
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Miyo!

71
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Miyo.

72
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Miyo.

73
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Miyo.

74
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Miyo.

75
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Miyo.

76
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Miyo.

77
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Miyo.

78
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miyo.

79
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Miyo.

80
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Miyo.

81
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Miyo.

82
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Miyo.

83
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Miyo.

84
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hello?

85
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hiroyuki.

86
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What are you doing?

87
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Everyone's waiting.

88
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.

89
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What's wrong?

90
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Nothing.

91
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Where are you?

92
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm at home.

93
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm at home.

94
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Where's Miyo?

95
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is she home?

96
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

97
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
She's asleep.

98
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
She said she was tired.

99
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
She's sleeping like she's dead.

100
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Morihira said to come here.

101
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What?

102
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I'm done.

103
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm dead.

104
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She's asleep like she's dead.

105
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hello?

106
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If there's no alive body, it's hard to keep winterschaft.

107
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You usually don't see cases onji

108
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
if there are no killings.

109
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Must be a particles.

110
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not sure.

111
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm not sure.

112
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm not sure.

113
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not sure.

114
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The End

115
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, you're late.

116
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you.

117
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Thank you.

118
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you.

119
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The End

120
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The End

121
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What are you doing here?

122
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I asked Yanagi.

123
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He said he'd be here if I wasn't at home.

124
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He said he was a high school student.

125
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He checked your mother's breathing, right?

126
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What about it?

127
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you relieved?

128
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Are you disappointed?

129
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Which one?

130
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Go home.

131
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I came to pick you up.

132
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

133
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I got a message from Yanagi.

134
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He wants you to come because he has something in mind.

135
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The End

136
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to find Mio as soon as possible.

137
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The fact that the mail came means that he's alive, right?

138
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I've tried to clean up the dead and the dead.

139
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What did you remember?

140
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm not doubting you.

141
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I thought I had to tell you something if I wanted to find Mio.

142
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Rinko...

143
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He wasn't at the store for an hour.

144
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The End

145
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes, he was sleeping on the second floor.

146
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He lives on the second floor.

147
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you remember the time?

148
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He went to bed at around 10.

149
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He came down before everyone went home, so he was downstairs at 11.

150
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
When Yuki was working, he would let me rest upstairs.

151
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He was tired from going out until noon.

152
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He thought I was suspicious.

153
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I just wanted to check.

154
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Who told you that I wasn't at the store at that time?

155
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Mr. Yanagi.

156
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why do you think so?

157
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There's no particular reason why, but...

158
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
When that mail came...

159
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's wrong?

160
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Mr. Yanagi!

161
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I can't take this.

162
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because the mail came.

163
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Do you think he's alive?

164
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

165
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I wonder if your mother is alive.

166
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I have to think so.

167
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I see.

168
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's talk about this later.

169
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We lost someone important to us.

170
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Mr. Yanagi.

171
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Unlike usual, I was scared.

172
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Scared?

173
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't explain it well.

174
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's what I felt.

175
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's talk about this later.

176
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If that's what you want.

177
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's not good to keep killing people with a flag.

178
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
To develop again, a bright image is important.

179
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But...

180
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This.

181
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
A woman who doesn't know if she's alive or dead sent a message.

182
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The police are searching the whole town.

183
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The mass media is in a big mess.

184
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The mansion is not selling.

185
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The image is bad.

186
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Please say something.

187
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's cold.

188
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a 25-year-old relationship.

189
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Mr. Nakabashi.

190
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Now, the serial killer is the victim.

191
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Now, the image of the serial killer is gone.

192
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's why it's a problem.

193
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The serial killer is not the culprit.

194
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, we can catch the culprit now.

195
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Who is the culprit?

196
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It doesn't matter who the culprit is.

197
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
As long as we can catch him.

198
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I see.

199
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If you want to investigate, bring a different person.

200
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I told you to ask the situation.

201
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You don't understand.

202
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What's wrong?

203
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I want to get Masaru's reference.

204
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The witness of the incident came out.

205
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Why?

206
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Masaru.

207
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Tell me everything.

208
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Tell me the truth.

209
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's go.

210
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Mr. Endo was at the scene.

211
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

212
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Masaru is innocent.

213
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I saw Mio last.

214
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So, you're done.

215
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Now, Mr. Tadokoro is getting the reference.

216
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why did you keep quiet?

217
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I didn't mean to...

218
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That day, he sent Mio home.

219
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He sent him home.

220
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Then, tell me quickly.

221
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He's been like this since long ago.

222
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What's wrong?

223
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's been like this for a while.

224
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What do you want to say?

225
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I want you to feel something creative.

226
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Above all, I want the culprit.

227
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It doesn't matter who it is.

228
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Right?

229
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
How was it?

230
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Why did you keep quiet?

231
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You're being forced to prove it again.

232
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What's with the American study abroad?

234
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What?

235
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You didn't even tell me.

236
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You've been fooling me.

237
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Did you know?

238
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I recently found out.

239
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
About the hospitalization?

240
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes.

241
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I heard from Yashiro.

242
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
He's suspicious of you.

243
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
He thought we were accomplices.

244
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I see.

245
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But it can't be helped if he's suspicious.

246
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Why?

247
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's strange.

248
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's been strange for a long time.

249
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I've been thinking about it since I was a kid.

250
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I keep dreaming about death.

251
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I wake up when I'm told.

252
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I've been short of sleep.

253
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So I can only rely on alcohol.

254
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Hello?

255
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I got another email.

256
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What?

257
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hiroyuki.

258
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
From Mio again.

259
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What's the content?

260
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Father.

261
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It hurts.

262
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Let me out.

263
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Ichi...

264
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes?

265
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Really?

266
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I understand.

267
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Where?

268
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's here.

269
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What?

270
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The last power source was near here.

271
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Call the emergency.

272
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes.

273
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Search thoroughly around here.

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes.

275
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Don't worry.

276
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll find it.

277
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It was Neko after all.

279
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I didn't know you were hiding your phone.

280
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
If you had told me, I would have been safer.

281
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What happened?

282
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
At that time,

283
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
before Mr. Yanagi got the email,

284
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Mr. Togashi left.

285
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
After that, he got the email right away.

286
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I thought it was strange.

287
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Father.

289
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It hurts.

290
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Listen.

291
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Did you send that to Rinko?

292
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes.

293
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Give me back my phone.

294
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Mio.

295
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Aren't you afraid of me?

296
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I had Mio's phone.

297
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He might be the culprit.

298
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No.

299
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Mr. Togashi is not the culprit.

300
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The culprit is...

301
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Mr. Yanagi.

302
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's right.

303
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That's why you sent the email and made him upset.

304
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The incident 25 years ago.

305
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So...

306
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Then...

307
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Mr. Togashi's sister...

308
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Your sister too?

309
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
My...

310
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
mother...

311
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You're afraid?

312
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Why can't you catch me?

313
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I have no evidence.

314
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Give me your phone.

315
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No.

316
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Leave it to me.

317
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll do it too.

318
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Mio.

319
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
If you have no evidence, I want to settle it myself.

320
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Stop it. It's dangerous.

321
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I can speak.

322
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No!

323
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I can't.

324
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I can't.

325
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I can't.

326
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Stop it!

327
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm serious.

328
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I sent another email before Mr. Togashi came.

329
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Why do you think I sent it from here?

330
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The place where your mother disappeared?

331
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's right.

332
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I imitated Mr. Togashi.

333
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What did you do?

334
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You must be upset and throw the ball.

335
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Catch him!

336
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is revenge.

337
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What did I think of this week?

338
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Hello?

340
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I know the location.

341
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Ashibiki-yama Shrine.

342
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Ashibiki-yama Shrine.

343
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
There.

344
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You're a beautiful woman.

345
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You look like a maid.

346
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Aren't you interested?

347
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm not interested.

348
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I've been missing for 10 years.

349
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I heard that there is a missing person.

350
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I heard that they go to check everywhere in the country.

351
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's a shame.

352
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I got another email from my father.

353
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
What's the location?

354
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Ashibiki-yama Shrine.

355
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What's the location?

356
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Stop it!

357
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Stop it!

358
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The location is Ashibiki-yama Shrine.

359
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yes.

360
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The location of the email is near here.

361
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's Ashibiki-yama Shrine.

362
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's a little bit far.

363
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think there's something meaningful.

364
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Mr. Yanagi.

365
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Do you have something in mind?

366
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I don't know.

367
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's pork.

369
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I cut the one I cut earlier.

370
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Is that so?

371
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The next day

372
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Welcome.

373
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Alone?

374
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes.

375
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yuki is off today.

376
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Do you have time?

377
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I told you to talk slowly.

378
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But I have to prepare for it.

379
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I have a reservation.

380
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I see.

381
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I wonder if you'll take this.

382
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's a piece of my heart.

383
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But...

384
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Mio...

385
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He won't come back.

386
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
He was killed.

387
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I wonder what your mother will be like.

388
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I hope she's safe.

389
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yuki's Mother

390
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Hello?

391
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes, I'm fine.

392
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's your wife.

393
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm waiting for you.

394
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Thank you.

395
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The customer...

396
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The customer...

397
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The customer...

398
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The customer...

399
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The customer...

400
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
The third email...

401
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It seems it was sent from Ashibiki Yamajinjo.

402
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The location of the first email was near Rinko's shop.

403
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
This time, it was the place where my mother disappeared.

404
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I think Rinko sent the email.

405
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Then, why would Rinko do that?

406
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
There's one thing I can think of.

407
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I think Yanagi is involved in the disappearance of my mother.

408
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I sent an email to Yanagi and tried to make him do the same.

409
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You knew about it, didn't you?

410
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It wasn't Tadokoro who was covering for you.

411
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It was Yanagi.

412
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The monster's identity is Yanagi.

413
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Isn't that right?

414
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
When you were young, you probably had a complicated feeling that no one could imagine.

415
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But why?

416
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Why would you protect a man who might have taken your sister?

417
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I didn't protect her.

418
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Then why didn't you confess?

419
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You knew Yanagi's crime and kept quiet until now.

420
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Isn't that a crime of coerce?

421
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Answer me!

422
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Answer me, Tokugashi!

423
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Hello? What's up?

424
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm going to look for my mother.

425
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's 10 meters from the foot of the bridge.

426
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's next to the stone.

427
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Next to the stone?

428
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
What do you mean?

429
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yanagi left her mother's hairpin.

430
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Tobashi-san, if he kills me, please catch him.

431
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Wait! Hello?

432
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What's wrong?

433
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Damn it!

435
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Tobashi-san, let go!

436
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'll take care of you.

437
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Rinko-chan is in danger!

438
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Please believe me!

439
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Let's go!

440
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Rinko-chan!

441
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll do as you wish.

442
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yanagi-san, I object to the death sentence.

443
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Alone?

444
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Is there something you want to say?

460
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You knew it wasn't your fault.

461
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Mr. Eikyo!

462
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Everything will be fine.

463
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
We have to find Kotone.

464
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We'll use any means to find her.

465
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'll tell you.

466
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'll let you meet Kotone no matter where she is buried.

467
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Kotone

468
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Kotone

469
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Kotone

470
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Kotone

471
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Kotone

472
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Kotone

473
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Kotone

474
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Kotone

475
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Kotone

476
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Kotone

477
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Kotone

478
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Kotone

479
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Kotone

480
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Kotone

481
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Kotone

482
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Kotone

483
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Kotone

484
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Kotone
