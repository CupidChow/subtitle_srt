1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Mio!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Mio is not coming back.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It doesn't matter who the culprit is.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If he's caught, why would he protect a man who might have taken his own sister?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Answer me, Togashi!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is there nothing to say?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Mio!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mio!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Mio!

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mio!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Mio!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mio!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Where is the second floor?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Mio!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mio!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Mio!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mio!

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Mio!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Shoko.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The second floor.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Mio!

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Mio!

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mio!

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mio!

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let go!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll take care of you.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Shoko is in danger!

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Trust me!

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What are you doing?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Togashi!

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tadokoro,

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
listen carefully.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's a stone ball in the 10-meter deep hole in the foot of the Hata River.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Rinko should be there.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please help me.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tadokoro.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We'll go to another place.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We'll catch Yanai.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No one will know.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll go.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hiroyuki.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You knew, didn't you?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're the one who left Yui.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What did you do?

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, of course.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shoko told me about Yanai.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can't remember the battle.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, it's been a long struggle.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I know such a thing as Mio.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What kind of girl Are you?

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Will you tell me?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't build a good story.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The way you blushed at Yanai is a little...

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's true.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Will you tell me?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're helping Yanai out a lot.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,920
The

58
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,960
The

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,720
arrested is Tatsuo Yanagi, who runs this liquor store.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:42,560
It seems that the body of Ms. Miho was found under the floor, and the police are investigating the murder weapon.

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,880
Hello.

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,960
I'm Ikarashi.

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,080
So did you find the cause?

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,440
The investigation is still going on, but there is a file that was closed with something like cloth.

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,240
So it's a suicide note from the police?

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Probably. There are other victims.

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,160
I think that all the events from 25 years ago were the crimes of Tatsuo Yanagi.

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
Hello.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,360
Ah.

70
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,840
Is it true that Masato was arrested?

71
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,280
I was with Mr. Togashi, but it's a matter of care.

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I understand.

74
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,800
If there is any movement again, please let me know.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Yes.

76
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,800
The cause is multiple organs?

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
Yes.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,760
The organs stopped moving and the heart stopped.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,320
When we examine it, there is a pressure in the liver, so there is a high possibility of hemorrhage.

80
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,520
There is a

81
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,720
hemorrhage, but it is not hemorrhage.

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,680
That's...

83
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,400
Multiple organs.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I didn't know.

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,400
When I was buried under the floor, I was still breathing.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Hello.

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Hello.

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Hello.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Hello.

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
How long are you going to keep quiet?

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm listening to the news on the night of October 6th.

96
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,400
What did you do when Mio came back?

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
What do you say?

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm hungry.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I'm hungry.

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm so hungry that I'm full of appetite.

101
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
How is it?

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
It's completely silent.

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
I don't spit.

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm hungry, but this is the first word of the day.

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
You're drunk.

106
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
You can spit whatever you want.

107
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
What's wrong?

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Spit it out!

109
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I thought I was going to die.

110
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm sorry to call you.

111
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
What?

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I'm busy.

113
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
It was a good deed.

114
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I arrested a serial killer who had not been solved for 25 years.

115
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I called you out to say that.

116
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I called you out to say that.

121
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
If you have the first credit, it's not me.

122
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
It's Mr. Togashi.

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
You're the one who's been guilty.

124
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
The investigation was carried out by your guidance.

125
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Isn't that a good thing?

126
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Your father was happy.

127
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm going to use my son to get out of prison.

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
It's like a father.

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
We're both.

130
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
You're going to use your father and me.

131
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Anyway, this is the main subject.

132
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I found the source of the skeleton.

133
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Fedele Reyes Sofia.

134
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
She was 28 years old and came from the Philippines.

135
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
She was arrested for illegal illegal activities ten years ago.

136
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
As I said before,

137
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I may have heard about her during the investigation,

138
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
but I don't remember.

139
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
The observation may say something, but that's all I know.

140
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,400
After that, I'll do something with my father.

141
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Hey, did you hear?

142
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
The family is...

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
It's like you don't see it.

144
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Fedele Reyes Sofia.

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Did you see it?

146
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Please.

147
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Let's go.

148
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Fedele Reyes Sofia.

149
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Hey, Yashiro.

150
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
What are you doing?

151
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
No, just a minute.

152
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Where's the chief?

153
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
You came to get it, didn't you?

154
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
It's been a year since Yanagi was me, so we'll give you a funeral.

155
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
It's cold here.

156
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,400
I was eating while you were eating, so I want you to take me out quickly.

157
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll be going now.

158
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I'll be going now.

159
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I should have called you when you were there.

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Stop it.

161
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
It's not anyone's fault.

162
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
You haven't answered me yet.

164
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,400
You knew about Yanagi's crime, but why did you keep quiet?

165
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
It happened three years ago.

166
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
The body-less murder case.

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
The body-less murder case.

168
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
There's no evidence to the evidence collected in Japan.

169
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Once it's empty, it'll be buried twice.

170
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,400
In the end, Takagi is still hiding his whereabouts.

171
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,400
He's still not aware of the body of the curse.

172
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
That's why I tried to get solid evidence this time.

173
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Is that what you mean?

174
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
I knew you were the culprit, but I didn't want to do anything to get you out of there.

175
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I tried to get solid evidence.

176
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Is that why you put your finger on it?

177
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Yeah.

178
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm sure Yanagi was very upset.

179
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
He knew about his crime.

180
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
But...

181
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
It's clearly a crime against the law.

182
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm going to arrest you.

183
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Okay.

184
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm ready.

185
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
But...

186
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll do it after I find everyone.

187
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
If I find all the victims he killed and buried,

188
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I'll be able to get you out of there.

189
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Then you can...

190
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
You can put your hand on me and get it done.

191
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Yes.

192
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
I understand.

193
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm right next to you.

194
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Yes.

195
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Yanagi is calling you.

196
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
He said he only wants to talk to you two.

197
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Hiroyuki.

198
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Is there anything you want to ask me?

199
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
You can go ahead.

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
You called us, didn't you?

202
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
That's true.

203
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I hate dirty women.

204
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,400
You drank with men, didn't you?

205
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
What do you mean?

206
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Don't go.

207
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
It's my fault.

208
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Let go.

209
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
From now on, don't go out.

210
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
No.

211
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
I don't understand.

212
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Listen to me.

213
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Don't touch me!

214
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
The bird is flying.

215
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Yanagi.

216
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Are you going to pick her up?

217
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
She's your girlfriend.

218
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
She's a bad girl.

219
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
She's a little bit annoying.

220
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
No.

221
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Stop it.

222
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
You're going to be a nuisance.

223
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
You're so dark.

224
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
You're so dark.

225
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
You can't handle that.

226
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
It's useless.

227
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
OK.

228
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Will you do it?

229
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
awa

230
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
You didn't方

231
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Don't you understand?

232
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
What?

233
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
It's an accident.

234
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
No...

235
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
No...

236
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
K-Kotone-chan...

237
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Yanagis-san...

238
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
That's...

239
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
What the hell?

240
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Don't...

241
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't...

242
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Don't...

243
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Don't...

244
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Don't...

245
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Don't...

246
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I was just trying to send a message to my friend.

247
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Friend?

248
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
You're not even in your right mind.

249
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
You're here.

250
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Who was it?

251
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Who was it?

252
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
How many people did you kill?

253
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,400
One, two, three, four...

254
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
I don't know.

255
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I don't know either.

256
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
It was all...

257
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
...just my imagination.

258
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Imagination?

259
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I imagined it would be like this.

260
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm just bored in the detention center.

261
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I don't have anything else to do.

262
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
He's enjoying himself.

263
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
He's not talking.

264
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
If he doesn't breathe, we can't find the body.

265
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Are those two okay?

266
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
We have to leave it to them.

267
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,400
If it's just your imagination, you can say anything.

268
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
What's your motive?

269
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Why did you kill him?

270
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Tell me.

271
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I punished them.

272
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
The women who committed the crime.

273
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,400
You mean all of them committed a crime?

274
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Yes.

275
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
That's right.

276
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Did those women...

277
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
...recover their sins?

278
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
They'll...

279
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,400
...eat and die before they can eat.

280
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Then they can go to heaven.

281
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
I don't know.

282
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Did they...

283
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
...murder Mio?

284
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Yes.

285
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Yes.

286
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
What kind of sin?

287
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
What kind of sin?

288
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,400
They were drinking with multiple men.

289
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Is that so?

290
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
They were a shameless girl.

291
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
They must have looked like their mother.

292
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm sure their mother...

293
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Mio left right after he drank.

294
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I don't know what happened to her.

295
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,400
What about Kana?

296
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
I don't know.

297
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
I don't know.

298
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm not interested.

299
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Why did you come out?

300
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
What kind of woman was she?

301
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Her name is Harumi Soma.

302
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
She was about the same age as me.

303
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
She was the best cabaret player in Adenoko.

304
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
You've been with her since you were little.

305
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
You've been thinking about her.

306
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I've heard that...

307
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
...a man is like his mother and a woman is like her father.

308
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
But Mio is not like her.

309
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Is she really your daughter?

310
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
What are you talking about?

311
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Shiro...

312
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Don't say anything strange.

313
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Mio...

314
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
...is my daughter.

315
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Isn't that right, Hiroki?

316
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
You've been dead since she was born.

317
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,400
You met your wife in a cabaret club.

319
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
That was 20 years ago.

320
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I heard that you were chasing after her.

321
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
You said you were chasing after her.

322
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
You said you were chasing after her even if you changed your job.

323
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
When did you know about her pregnancy?

324
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
It's a crime. Stop it!

325
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Don't make me laugh!

326
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
You should be protected!

327
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Otherwise, I won't investigate you anymore.

328
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
I see.

329
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
So that's what happened.

330
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I'm glad you're not her father.

331
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,400
You knew, didn't you?

332
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
That she wasn't your daughter.

333
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Don't touch me!

334
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
The bird is flying.

335
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
The bird is...

336
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
...flying?

337
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes.

338
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
I hate it.

339
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
You're going against your father?

340
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
What?

341
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Is he really my father?

342
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I've been thinking.

343
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
There's no point living with someone who doesn't think he's your father.

344
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Stop it.

345
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll find out if you're my father.

346
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Shiga.

347
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Don't lie!

348
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
You knew, didn't you?

349
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
That she wasn't her daughter.

350
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
That her father was another man.

351
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Stop it!

352
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Stop it!

353
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Let go!

354
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Let go!

355
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
She was like a partner for ten years.

356
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
She was perfectly fine.

357
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Chief.

358
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Please let me take a break.

359
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
A break?

360
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,400
A break with the supporters?

361
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Take it off.

362
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm glad the culprit was caught.

363
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
What's wrong?

364
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
What's the matter?

365
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
What's the matter?

366
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
You're worried?

367
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
It's too early to be at ease.

368
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,400
The whole story will be revealed from now on.

369
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
It's a serial murder case.

370
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I can't imagine how many bodies will be killed.

371
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
That's true.

372
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,400
The image of Chief Hata is getting worse.

373
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
But it's true that the popularity is rising.

374
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
The mass media is making a fuss.

375
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,400
The SNS is also writing a lot.

376
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Did you see that?

377
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,400
The people are having fun.

378
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
You're not laughing, are you?

379
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Anyway,

380
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:15,400
the case that was unsolved for 25 years is finally solved.

381
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,400
No more serious cases will occur.

382
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Now,

383
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Chief Hata has become a city without crimes.

384
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,400
We have no choice but to push through.

385
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
That's right.

386
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Is there anything else you're worried about?

387
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I have a favor to ask you.

388
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
What?

389
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
What?

390
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
What?

391
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
If you have something to say, please say it.

392
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I have nothing to say.

393
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
How was the investigation?

394
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,400
How much did the criminal confess?

395
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
No, he won't say a word.

396
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't know the details.

397
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,400
You should ask him. You're a police officer.

398
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
He's not in charge.

399
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Togashi is investigating.

400
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Togashi?

401
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Why?

402
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
It's a suspect's mission.

403
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
He won't say a word.

404
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Did you hear anything from Togashi?

405
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
What?

406
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
How much did Yanagi say?

407
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
No.

408
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Why are you so worried?

409
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Why?

410
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I'm interested.

411
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Are you hiding something from me?

412
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
I'm not hiding anything.

413
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
When your mother lies, you know.

414
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Stop it.

415
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
You're drinking too much.

416
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Enough.

417
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
I can't sleep.

418
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
You don't know.

419
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
You're busy.

420
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Where?

421
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Inspector Yashiro.

422
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I came to Yanagi's house.

423
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
I checked the location of his cell phone.

424
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
He often comes here.

425
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,400
The day before he killed Mio.

426
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
The day before?

427
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Who is he?

428
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Why are you here?

429
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
I found out his whereabouts.

430
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,400
10 years ago, Sophia was arrested.

431
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,400
The person who was arrested was Harumi Soma.

432
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Mio's mother.

433
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
This is her.

434
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I checked the place.

435
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,400
She worked at this store for several years.

436
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I got the information.

437
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,400
She had a picture of her in her wallet.

438
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Yes.

439
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
This is it.

440
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
A picture 20 years ago.

441
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I think he was looking for her.

442
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
I don't know.

443
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I came here the day before he killed Mio.

444
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Why do you think I'm looking for her?

445
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
What was she going to do?

446
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
To get back together?

447
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I don't think so.

448
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Yes.

449
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
To kill her.

450
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Did those women regret it?

451
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,400
I couldn't forgive the woman who abandoned me and ran away.

452
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
That's what happened.

453
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Harumi Soma

454
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,400
This man was looking for this woman, Harumi Soma.

455
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I don't know.

456
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Sayaka?

457
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,400
She worked here for several years.

458
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Someone said someone was looking for her.

459
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Where is she now?

460
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
She died.

461
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Last year, in a car accident.

462
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
The day before he killed Mio.

463
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Where was she?

464
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
I didn't kill her.

465
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
It was on October 5th.

466
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I visited a snack shop in Nishikawa-go.

467
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Where did you see this picture?

468
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
A employee remembered.

469
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
She was looking for her.

470
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Is it illegal to look for a wife?

471
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
It's not illegal.

472
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I heard Harumi died.

473
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I feel sorry for her.

474
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
You look happy.

475
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Did you kill Mio instead of Harumi?

476
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
What are you talking about?

477
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,400
I heard she died in a car accident.

478
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,400
She was looking for a woman who abandoned her for 20 years.

479
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,400
She was looking for her for 20 years.

480
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
She was a big shot.

481
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,400
She was so stupid.

482
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,400
She said she looked like Harumi.

483
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Is she really my father?

484
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Is she really my father?

485
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Are you abandoning me too?

486
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Are you abandoning me too?

487
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I was so angry.

488
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I won't let you get away this time.

489
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
I was so angry.

490
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I was so angry with Harumi.

491
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
I was so angry.

492
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Yashiro-san.

493
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,400
You're too much into movies.

494
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Mio is my child.

495
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm sure of it.

496
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
I'm sure of it.

497
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,400
99.99%

498
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I won't forget about my parents.

499
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
You bastard!

501
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
You're so annoying!

502
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Harumi was killed when she was found.

503
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm glad you didn't find her.

504
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
What?

505
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
She's still alive.

506
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
She knew you were looking for her.

507
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
She thought she was dead.

508
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
You're lying.

509
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
I'm telling the truth.

510
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
I'm telling the truth.

511
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,400
It doesn't say she's dead.

512
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,400
You couldn't confirm it because you didn't put the stone in.

513
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,400
You killed the wrong person.

514
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
You killed the wrong person.

515
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
A man who should be killed is alive.

516
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Are you going to get caught?

517
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm doing my best.

518
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,400
The stone is illegal.

519
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
If you have a problem, you can ask your father.

520
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Akiyama, be quiet.

521
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I can't find the body without a confession.

522
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
You're confessing to a dead person?

523
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Be quiet.

524
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Iroki.

525
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
The stone isn't me.

526
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
It's true.

527
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
It's not me.

528
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm not going to call you.

529
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
I don't want to see you again.

530
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
It's true.

531
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
I'm not lying.

532
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:40,400
I gave Kotone back to you.

533
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm not going to call you.

534
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
I'm not going to call you.

535
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
I'm not going to call you.

536
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,400
I have a story to tell you.

537
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
I don't have one.

538
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
I'll tell you.

539
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Where you buried it.

540
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
You want to see your sister, don't you?

541
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I'm sorry.

542
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Instead...

543
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Find Harumi.

544
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Bring her to me.

545
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Then...

546
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
I'll let you see Kotone.

547
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Did you find her?

548
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Yes.

549
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
She's not fully recovered yet.

550
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,400
But she found a few places where she buried her body.

551
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm digging up the body.

552
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,400
The incident 25 years ago was also Yanagi's crime?

553
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Yes.

554
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
We're watching it.

555
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,400
So you didn't tell me anything about that incident?

556
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
No, not yet.

557
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
I see.

558
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I'm just curious because it happened when I was the president.

559
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
I see.

560
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Then I'm counting on you.

561
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
The whole country is watching.

562
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
I'll do my best.

563
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,400
What is it? Are you worried about your father?

564
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,400
You look like you're not going to cry.

565
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Don't worry.

566
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Everything will be fine.

567
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
The incident is resolved.

568
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,400
The situation is that the son is the president's son.

569
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,400
And the redevelopment is going on.

570
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
I'm also worried.

571
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
One more time!

572
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
This way!

573
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
There she is!

574
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
No!

575
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
It's dangerous!

576
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Let go!

577
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
She's my mother!

578
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I'll let you go.

579
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
But you can't go.

580
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
I don't know yet.

581
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I have to check her DNA.

582
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I see.

583
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
It's not that she's your mother.

584
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
She might be someone else.

585
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Something came out!

586
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
The clock tower.

587
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
Yes.

588
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Mother...

589
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Mother...

590
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
I'm sorry.

591
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,400
There are seven people who were found.

592
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,400
I'll tell you the details.

593
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,400
They're all in their 30s to 40s.

594
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,400
There are no women in their 20s.

595
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,400
I'll use any means to find Kotone.

596
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,400
I have to find Kotone.

597
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,400
You want to arrest me?

598
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,400
I'm here to pick you up.

599
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
I'm on leave today.

600
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,400
Are you on leave?

601
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
I'm sorry.

602
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Yes.

603
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,400
What's going on with the manager?

604
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,400
What's going on with the manager?

605
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Tell me the truth!

606
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
I'll do something.

607
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Just like 25 years ago.

608
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
Don't dig a hole!

609
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Don't go!

610
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Stop!

611
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
I'm sorry.

612
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
I'm sorry.

613
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
I'm sorry.

614
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
I'm sorry.

615
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
I'm sorry.

616
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
I'm sorry.

617
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm sorry.

618
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
I'm sorry.

619
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
I'm sorry.

620
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
I'm sorry.

621
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
I'm sorry.

622
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
I'm sorry.

623
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm sorry.

624
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
I'm sorry.

625
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
I'm sorry.

626
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
I'm sorry.

627
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm sorry.

628
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm sorry.

630
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
I'm sorry.

631
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
I'm sorry.

632
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
I'm sorry.

633
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
I'm sorry.

634
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
I'm sorry.

635
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,400
I'm sorry.

636
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
I'm sorry.

637
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
I'm sorry.

638
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
I'm sorry.

639
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
I'm sorry.

640
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
I'm sorry.

642
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
I'm sorry.

643
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
I'm sorry.

644
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
I'm sorry.

645
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
I'm sorry.

646
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
I'm sorry.

647
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
I'm sorry.
