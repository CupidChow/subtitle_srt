00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Grandpa!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Grandpa!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Grandpa Abe!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Grandpa!

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Episode 1

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Grandpa!

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Grandpa!

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Togashi!

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Togashi!

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Masaru! Where are you?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm here!

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What's wrong, Masaru?

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Episode 2

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 3

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You should rest a bit.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you. The exam is coming up.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Really?

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Just a little bit.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Kotone's piano is great.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's in the famous range.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And it's beautiful.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's good to play it.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm really looking forward to the future.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well,

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
compared to that,

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is Hiro-chan okay?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She's been out of college and is fluttering.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I wonder if the twins are different.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Angel and Marito.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're my heart-throbbing angel.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Angel and Marito.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Whenever...

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Stop it.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How long have you been drinking coffee?

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm not a customer.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're coming?

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Get a grip on yourself.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're fluttering every day.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You should learn from your sister.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Shut up.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I have a dream.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What dream?

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm a musician.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My sister plays the piano.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I play the guitar.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have a session.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're a musician.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm looking forward to the concert.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Shut up.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's okay.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Can I talk to you?

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Show me your bag.

65
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm not done yet.

67
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's a drug dealer.

68
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let go.

69
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Who are you?

70
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm a policeman.

71
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Me too.

72
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm Masato Yashiro.

73
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm here to serve.

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you.

75
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm Akiyawa, the director.

76
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you remember?

77
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We met when you were little.

78
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's been 25 years.

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
When your father was the director,

80
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was a policeman.

81
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was used to it.

82
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a joke.

84
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I love you.

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm fine.

86
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Excuse me.

87
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm the director of the Life Safety Department.

88
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm Masato Yashiro.

89
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm Morihira, the director of the Life Safety Department.

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm Yashiro.

91
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm Morihira.

92
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He's my senior.

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm the director now.

94
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Tokyo University?

95
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a law major.

96
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How old are you?

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm 28.

98
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm in the police department.

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can't go back to the police department.

100
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I see.

101
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why did you go to the police department?

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He's the son of the director.

103
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Director?

104
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The director of the police department.

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're the best.

106
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He's the director of the police department.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He was the director of the police department.

108
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You have to get along with him.

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He may come back in the future.

110
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He's not here.

111
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He's here for the director and the director.

112
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I see.

113
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What do you mean?

114
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's wrong?

115
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Nothing.

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Excuse me.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm Yashiro.

118
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm Masato Yashiro.

119
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Nice to meet you.

120
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm Endo Kasuya.

121
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You met Akezu Togashi?

122
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

123
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You two can teach him a lesson.

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Thank you.

125
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wait!

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Takuka.

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Takuka.

128
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This is where the mall will be.

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The parking lot is just wide.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is this the mansion?

131
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Wait!

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Togashi.

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Be quiet.

135
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I just want to talk.

136
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Shut up!

137
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You want to eat?

138
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't mess with me!

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Ouch!

140
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sorry to bother you.

141
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you know him?

142
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He's my son's friend.

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He's a detective at the police station.

144
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't you remember?

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He was arrested for a crime 25 years ago.

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Togashi.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Go to the police station.

148
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

149
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is this how you always do?

150
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What?

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You were hit on purpose.

152
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He's a D.V. man who helps children.

153
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He's a man who's always been a man.

154
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He's too hard.

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You have to be hard.

156
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You have to be hard.

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You have to be hard.

158
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You don't know about your career.

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It has nothing to do with my career.

160
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm saying that illegal operations are a problem.

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Illegal.

162
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're a law-abiding detective.

163
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What did you do in the police station?

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Four years.

165
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're still young.

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hello?

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I understand.

168
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll look for you right away.

169
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm going to look for my grandfather.

170
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Grandfather?

171
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a good impression.

172
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's a good impression.

173
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll visit you occasionally.

174
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is...

175
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yu.

176
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Grandfather!

177
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Grandfather!

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Answer me!

179
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Grandfather, are you there?

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Grandfather Abe!

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Grandfather!

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Grandfather Abe!

183
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Grandfather!

184
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Do you understand?

185
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't understand.

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't understand.

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Let's go home.

188
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's okay.

189
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's okay.

190
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's okay.

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's okay.

192
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What are you doing?

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Grandfather, it's okay.

194
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Grandfather!

195
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's okay.

196
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's go home.

197
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Grandfather!

198
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I told Ashihara.

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I knew it.

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If anything happens again, please contact me.

201
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You have a call for the house you live in, right?

202
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can call...

203
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, I'll call you.

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You want me to go to the old man's home as soon as possible, right?

205
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No.

206
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I want to do that, too.

207
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to do that, too.

208
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But I don't have the courage.

209
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Can you take care of me instead of Togashi?

210
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Even if you do that.

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't.

212
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't.

213
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go.

214
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What's wrong?

215
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Are you being held by your weakness?

216
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I can't.

217
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Please.

218
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're not going to do it?

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll do it myself.

221
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you care about that, you can't go on.

222
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What if I take a shower?

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No, it's okay.

224
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't like showers in places like this.

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In places like this?

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Should I go to the toilet?

227
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No.

228
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Maybe five people.

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They might come later.

230
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll be in your care.

231
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay.

232
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's about time.

233
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Is it free?

234
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Everyone's going to join, right?

235
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, I...

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

237
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm not going to join.

238
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What are you talking about?

239
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's your welcome party.

240
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Come without me.

241
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm surprised.

242
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Over there.

243
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's a restaurant that's been around for a long time.

244
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Welcome party.

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's usually here.

246
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm hungry.

247
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Good evening.

248
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Come on in.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Rinko, our female shopkeeper.

250
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yuki, our part-timer.

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They're both beautiful.

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is Ayashino.

253
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Nice to meet you.

254
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Nice to meet you.

255
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't use your looks.

256
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He's not the kind of person you can get close to.

257
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What do you mean?

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Stop it.

259
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ayashino, come here.

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you.

261
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Excuse me.

262
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You're a good cook.

263
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No.

264
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Rinko, get ready.

265
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm going to make some oolong tea.

266
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

267
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oolong tea.

268
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The pork is delicious.

269
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why did the career group come to this country?

270
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Did they come to work?

271
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They're usually at home.

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I want to experience the field more.

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I've lived in this town since I was a kid.

274
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They asked me if I was selfish.

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Did your father object?

276
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
My father has nothing to do with it.

277
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Good work.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Welcome.

279
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're here.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm Tadokoro, a police officer.

281
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm Togashi's classmate.

282
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm Yashiro.

283
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm Endo.

284
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm Anne.

285
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm Yashiro. Nice to meet you.

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
She's the director of the police department.

287
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
She's a good person.

288
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Stop it.

289
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You don't look like your father.

290
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't talk about your father.

291
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I heard you talked about your mother.

292
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
She was in my mother's room during the day.

293
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was surprised to see her.

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I heard you were always noisy.

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
She's the old lady in the room.

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
She's Tadokoro's mother.

297
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
She's a police officer.

298
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is that so?

299
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
She's a candidate for the next governor.

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know her well.

301
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Stop talking nonsense.

302
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Who's talking nonsense?

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Stop it.

304
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Ryo, bring me some drinks.

305
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

306
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Do you want some?

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll have some salad.

308
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll have some.

309
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
How many years has it been since you left?

310
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's almost been 12 years.

311
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I see.

312
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Togashi-san.

314
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you think she's alive?

315
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I can't say anything.

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Your sister is alive?

317
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's okay.

319
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you can do something, tell me.

320
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Thank you.

321
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thank you for waiting.

322
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Thank you.

323
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please.

324
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Togashi-san.

325
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I haven't heard your answer yet.

326
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What kind of weakness is that old man's daughter holding?

327
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I killed someone.

328
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The daughter of the house.

329
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
How?

330
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Her neck.

331
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Did you kill her?

332
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't know.

333
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Togashi-san.

334
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Miho, are you drunk?

335
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A little.

336
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You're shaking your legs.

337
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I had a drink party.

338
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The boy was popular, so he drank me.

339
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm totally fine.

340
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Are you okay?

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Don't be so spoiled.

342
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The house is right there.

343
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Walk.

344
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Togashi-san.

345
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I want to live alone.

346
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You can go to college.

347
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Right now?

348
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What about your father?

349
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
He's not here.

350
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let him go.

351
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He's the only parent.

352
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The only parent.

353
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You were together?

354
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yes.

355
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I was there.

356
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Where's the food?

357
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I ate.

358
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
See you.

359
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Good night.

360
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
How much is this?

361
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
1800 yen.

362
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Hey.

363
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Did you do well?

364
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

365
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
With Miho?

366
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
No.

367
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Not really.

368
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Really?

369
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
See you.

370
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Hiroyuki.

371
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What?

372
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Don't drink too much.

373
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Bye.

374
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Hello?

375
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
How was your first day?

376
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It was okay.

377
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The director said it was okay.

378
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Akiyama?

379
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
He's an old friend.

380
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I heard so.

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's been a year.

382
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's been a year.

388
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I should've come back to the police station.

389
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I asked your young man for a special reason.

390
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Come back to Tokyo after a year.

391
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I understand.

392
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Bye.

393
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The first incident occurred 25 years ago.

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
27-year-old Abe Kaori was murdered in Hatano.

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It was a murder.

396
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The victim's hands and feet were tied.

397
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
The fingertips were cut from the first joint.

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
At that time, the victim's hands and feet were cut from the first joint.

399
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The victim's hands and feet were cut from the first joint.

400
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The victim's hands and feet were cut from the first joint.

401
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The victim, 20 years old Togashi Kotone, was also missing.

402
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
These two incidents are very similar to the serial murder in the Kandao district.

403
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
They might be the same crime.

404
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
25 years ago, a man was arrested as a suspect.

405
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm Togashi Kotone's twin brother.

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm Togashi Hiroki.

408
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm at the Hata No-Shi, Ibaraki Prefecture Police Station.

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Togashi?

410
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He was a member of the police station three years ago.

411
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He was famous as a replacement.

412
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I was unable to prove it at the time.

413
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I have a problem with him.

414
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
A suspect was shot by a suspect.

415
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I have a problem with him.

416
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I have a problem with him.

417
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So you were shot by the Hata No-Shi.

418
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Togashi is the star of serial murder?

419
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't deny the possibility.

420
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:05,080
Togashi Kotone's

421
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,000
I bought you an apple juice.

422
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You like apple juice, don't you?

423
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Togashi?

424
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, no.

425
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll have a drink.

426
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I drank it the other day.

427
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'll give you some more.

428
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll have a drink.

432
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'll have a drink.

433
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You're always bad.

434
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm sorry to have taken care of you.

435
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Be careful.

437
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You're working, aren't you?

438
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm on my way to delivery.

439
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Hello.

440
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
When?

441
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'll find it right away.

442
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Is it your grandfather again?

443
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
No, not at all.

444
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Where's Togashi?

445
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He's looking for his grandfather in Ashiwara.

446
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Again?

447
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Help me.

448
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That's where the body was found 25 years ago, isn't it?

449
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That's right.

450
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Is that grandfather the victim's father?

451
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah.

452
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He's looking for his daughter there.

453
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Togashi was arrested as a suspect at the time.

454
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't have enough evidence to prove it, but I can't agree with the family.

455
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Is that what you mean?

456
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Well, yeah.

457
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Can I ask you something?

458
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What is it?

459
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
At that time, the one who arrested Togashi was Chief Morihira, right?

460
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You know well.

461
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
What was the decision?

462
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The guitar pick was dropped.

463
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Togashi.

464
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
There was also a witness statement that he was arguing with the victim.

465
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Something's wrong.

466
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Something's wrong.

467
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Hirayuki.

468
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I told you it wasn't me.

469
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't have any evidence, but I was confident.

470
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Is he a detective?

471
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah.

472
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But in the end, he was arrested.

473
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Then he changed.

474
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That's right.

475
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He was not only the culprit of the murder.

476
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
He didn't understand his sister's desire.

477
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
In the end, the world knew that he was involved in the disappearance.

478
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
As if to mock Togashi, Kotone's life was not seen.

479
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Kotone!

480
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Please come back.

481
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Kotone!

482
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Kotone!

483
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Please come back!

484
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Please!

485
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But the misfortune continued.

486
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Please.

487
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Please.

488
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Please.

489
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Please.

490
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's a mess here.

491
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Dad!

492
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Dad!

493
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Please!

494
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
He was a criminal.

495
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Something broke in his heart.

496
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
His mother too.

497
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
His mother lost her life in shock.

498
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The person he once arrested is now a subordinate.

499
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I don't know what will happen in life.

500
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You should hate the police.

501
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Why did you become a police officer?

502
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
To make a revenge.

503
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
My sister and parents.

504
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
A man who can use a gun to kill a man like us.

505
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
If you make a mistake, you will hurt your opponent.

506
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I did it for Togashi.

507
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is this your goal?

508
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You can't get rid of your career.

509
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Did you come to investigate the old case?

510
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm personally interested.

511
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I haven't solved it yet.

512
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Solve the unsolved case and make it easy.

513
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm like my father.

515
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I can do whatever I want.

516
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But think about it.

517
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Even in this place,

518
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I can't leave people.

519
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
25 years ago?

521
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yes. I came to investigate the case.

522
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
What are you going to do with that old case?

523
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm going to the flag office.

524
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm a little worried.

525
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What is he thinking?

526
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't know.

527
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
He's climbing the stairs.

528
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I have to step on it.

529
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll keep an eye on him.

530
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Please.

531
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Excuse me.

532
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Grandpa!

533
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Grandpa Abe!

534
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Grandpa!

535
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Grandpa!

536
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Why are you here?

537
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm here to help you.

538
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Do whatever you want.

539
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Grandpa Abe!

540
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Answer me!

541
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Grandpa!

542
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Grandpa!

543
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Grandpa!

544
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I missed you!

545
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Masaru, where are you?

546
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm here!

547
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm here!

548
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What's wrong?

549
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Masaru, go back to the car and report.

560
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yes.

561
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Who is it?

562
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You know this woman, don't you?

563
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
How can you be with her in this condition?

564
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Togashi-san, I have something to ask you.

565
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Did you really kill her?

566
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Hey!

568
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You're here.

569
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You found your finger, didn't you?

570
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Did the police do it?

571
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I have to be a monster to catch a monster.

572
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What are you going to do?

573
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You know something.

574
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
25 years ago, the fight was perfect.

575
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So tell me, did you kill Mio-san?

576
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Who killed Tadokoro-san?

577
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Who killed the girl?

578
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
She was the one who killed him.

579
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000

I don't know.

582
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
He was a bad guy.

583

I don't know.

584
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So, you're saying you killed him?
