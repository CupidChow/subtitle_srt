1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
The

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Sea

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
was killed?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Before the body was found,

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
he had no remuneration.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
The police are working

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
on our plan.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
I will not disappear.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
I will definitely catch you.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Then whose phone is this?

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
That DNA

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
came out of the phone.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
I can't do such cruel things.

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
A monster?

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
I will hold it.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Did you do it?

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
This is the day before

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
the phone was found.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
What was in this?

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Rice balls.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Rice balls?

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
I bought them at the convenience store.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Which convenience store?

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
I will find out if I look it up.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
No, it's a misunderstanding.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
I thought I was holding it.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Do you think it's a misunderstanding?

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm tired recently.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm bored.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Don't play with me.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Why did you go into the mountains with rice balls?

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I wanted to eat it.

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
At 9 o'clock in the evening?

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
I will buy it at any time.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
What is this?

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Why is Mio's marriage here?

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I don't know.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I don't know.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Mio came to my house.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Maybe he got hurt.

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,040
You did the

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
I wanted to hide the traces.

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
So I

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
I took Mio to the basement.

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
I cut my finger

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
and killed him.

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
I cleaned it to erase the traces.

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
You want to say that?

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Please forgive me.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Why is marriage so important?

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
If you cut off 10 fingers,

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
the blood will be removed.

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
If you clean it well,

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
the blood will be removed.

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
This is the only marriage.

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
It's strange.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Mio, who was cute like a daughter,

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
disappeared.

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
The next day,

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
he was found with his finger cut off.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
He cleaned the basement.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
If you cut your finger,

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
the blood will be removed.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
This is the only marriage.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Anyway,

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
the cleaning was shown on the security camera.

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
The security camera?

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
I don't know.

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Was there a video of you cutting your finger on that camera?

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Of course not.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
I can stop the camera.

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Then you can stop it when you clean it.

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
If you have a bad feeling,

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
why didn't you stop it?

75
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
The kitchen is not the basement.

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
What?

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Another place.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
A place where you can use the knife you want.

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
The murder case?

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Did I do it?

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
No.

82
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Don't say that.

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
What?

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
It's possible that this store was used for crime.

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
I'm sure.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Don't say that.

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll find out.

88
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
I'll find out.

89
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
I'll find out.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
I'll find out.

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I'll find out.

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Don't say that.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
I'll find out.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's start.

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Please stand up.

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Please stand up.

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Do you remember your mother's disappearance?

98
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
My mother was at home.

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Your father just died.

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
I think you're lying.

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
You found the fingerprints.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Is it related?

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I don't know.

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Please take a picture.

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
It's been 25 years.

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
So the story is...

107
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
It's about the re-opening of Hatano.

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
I wanted to make it a success.

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
If I die in the murder case like 25 years ago,

110
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I'll be a monster.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
I'll be a monster.

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
I'll be a monster.

113
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I'll be a monster.

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I'll be a monster.

115
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Re-opening is a business that the people have been waiting for for many years.

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
If you cut it off, it will have a big impact on the area.

117
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,040
What's the relationship between re-opening and me?

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Your son's number came out of the phone.

119
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Of course, something's wrong.

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
The situation is over.

121
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
If people don't watch this disappearance case,

122
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
no one will care about this.

123
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
What do you want to say?

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
It doesn't sound like a case.

125
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
I'll handle it without hurting your son's career.

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I want the police to cooperate with Hatano's re-opening.

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
What are you going to do?

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Leave it to me.

129
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I won't cause any trouble.

130
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Is that okay?

131
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Then...

132
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Reino, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Please proceed with your case.

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
What's going to happen?

135
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Please watch the end of tomorrow's case.

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Good work.

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
It's not a BBQ restaurant.

138
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
There are a lot of weddings, but they're mostly animal houses.

139
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Almost?

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
There was a woman's wedding in this knife.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
It was a marriage, but the DNA was found.

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
The DNA that matches it was in the database.

143
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
I think...

144
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Yoshie Matsuda.

145
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Why?

146
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Rinko Matsuda's mother.

147
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
She disappeared 10 years ago.

148
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Hello?

150
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm with Yoshie Matsuda.

151
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
The marriage isn't from Miyo Yanagi.

152
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
It's not from Miyo.

153
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
It's not related to BBQ.

154
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I have to take the blame if I don't have evidence.

155
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I don't think it's possible.

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
The press is leaving it funny and strange.

157
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
The culprit is the police.

158
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
If it's a crime, the police will be in trouble again.

159
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
What are you doing?

160
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Stop it, Masato.

162
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
It's for you.

163
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
If you don't have evidence, you can't arrest me.

164
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
You're going to return it as it is?

165
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I don't have any evidence.

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
You idiot!

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
You're the culprit of Togashi and you're making a fuss about the press.

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
We can't arrest you in this situation.

169
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Then find the evidence.

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
If you return it as it is, we'll be in trouble.

171
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Thank you.

172
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I have no choice.

173
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I'll start over from the beginning.

174
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Can't you arrest me because you're a different case?

175
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
That's impossible.

176
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
It's not impossible.

177
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Think about something.

178
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Masato!

179
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
He's a bad guy.

180
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
He's the one who exposed his face to the camera.

181
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Did you do it?

182
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Say something!

183
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
What is it?

184
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
It's a gift for me.

185
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
A gift?

186
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
I was the one who told Togashi to arrest him 15 years ago.

187
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I was in the police department at the time.

188
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I was with Mr. Morihira.

189
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I still remember that time.

190
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
He's a bad guy.

191
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Excuse me.

192
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Tadakoro?

193
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I have something to tell you.

194
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I missed the timing to tell you.

195
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
It's my mistake.

196
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
What is it?

197
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Togashi is innocent.

198
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Why can't you live?

199
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
The night Yanagi Mio disappeared,

200
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
he was with me.

201
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
What?

202
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
What do you mean?

203
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
What do you mean?

204
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
It's the same as 25 years ago.

205
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Togashi is the only one who can prove it.

206
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Why didn't Togashi say he was with you this time?

207
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
It's the same as 25 years ago.

208
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
You didn't want to involve me, did you?

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
I didn't want to involve you.

210
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
You didn't want to involve me, did you?

211
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Really?

212
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Were you really with Togashi?

213
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Yes.

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
If you're going to lie, hurry up.

215
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
I was with you that day.

216
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I was with you that day.

217
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
That's fine.

218
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

219
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Welcome.

220
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Welcome.

221
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
I'm free from the prison.

222
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
You're not free.

223
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Togashi.

224
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Tiko.

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
You're bothering me.

226
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
I didn't think you'd come here.

227
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
I didn't come out.

228
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Of course.

229
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
That's right.

230
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
I'll be right there.

231
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I'll be right there.

232
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I'm going to play with Mio.

233
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
She's really bad.

234
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
She said she was a lot of outcasts.

235
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Maybe it's just a rumor.

236
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
I heard she was talking about her.

237
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
I don't hear much good rumors.

238
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Mio was really bad.

239
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
I heard she was playing with men.

240
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
What is this?

241
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Mio is not like this.

242
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
What is that?

243
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
She was a lot of outcasts.

244
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
She was often with men at school.

245
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm going to play with Mio.

246
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
She was a lot of outcasts.

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
She was often with men at school.

248
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
What is this?

249
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
You're kidding me.

250
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
It's terrible.

251
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Mio.

252
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Mio.

253
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
It's illegal.

259
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
What did you do wrong?

260
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
You killed her.

261
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Is it because a woman who cut her finger is being killed?

262
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I don't know.

263
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
That's right.

264
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,040
If I say so, it sounds like I'm confessing.

265
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
I'm recording anyway.

266
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Rinko's mother who disappeared 10 years ago.

268
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Matsuda Yoshie.

269
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
They were close.

270
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
That's also Togatsu's doing.

271
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Like Mio.

272
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
They become close and then kill each other.

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I understand how you feel.

274
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
You want to take my confession, right?

275
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
There's no other evidence.

276
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
I have a perfect alibi.

277
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Is it perfect?

278
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
A good friend's testimony.

279
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
25 years ago, the alibi was perfect.

280
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
25 years ago, the alibi was perfect.

284
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,040
If you have time to doubt me, why don't you worry about yourself?

285
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,040
You used her as a bait, right?

286
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,040
She was killed because of you.

287
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
You'll find out who she is.

288
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
What are you going to do?

289
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
You want me to kill you?

290
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Before that, I'll take you in.

291
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
I promise.

293
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
I didn't tell you to let her go.

294
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I feel sorry for Mio.

295
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
That's information from another place.

296
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Where is it?

297
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I can't tell you.

298
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
That's enough.

299
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
You and I are done.

300
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Don't contact me again.

301
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
No way.

302
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Endo, let's get along.

303
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
No.

304
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Why did you leave?

305
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Because you're not the culprit.

306
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
If the press makes a fuss,

307
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I thought you'd be exposed.

308
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
What if I'm the culprit?

309
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
That's impossible.

310
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Why?

311
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Are you sure?

312
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
I'm sure.

313
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
What are you hiding?

314
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
The house.

315
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
That night,

316
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
on the day Mio disappeared,

317
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I saw Mio

318
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
on my way to the BBQ restaurant.

319
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
I saw her.

320
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
And then,

321
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Tadokoro came.

322
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Why did you lie to me?

323
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I thought Mio was with her.

324
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
If I told you,

325
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
you'd think I was the culprit.

326
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Masaru,

327
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
don't tell anyone.

328
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Take her to the graveyard.

329
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Got it?

330
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Yes.

331
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Hello?

332
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Hello?

333
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Thank you, Mr. Tatsuo Yanagi.

334
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm Yanagi.

335
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
I'm the father

336
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
of a girl who disappeared.

337
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
I haven't found

338
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
my daughter yet,

339
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
but I'm sorry

340
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
for my own fault.

341
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
I don't want to

344
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
re-release the bomb.

345
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Stop!

346
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Togashi.

347
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Get off.

348
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Hiroaki.

349
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
What do you want?

350
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm worried

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
about Mio.

352
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
I want to help

353
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
you.

354
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm just being used.

355
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Are you trying to get in my way again?

356
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
You need me 25 years ago!

357
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
I lost my money

358
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
because of you!

359
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
You killed your own sister,

360
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
but you're the worst.

361
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
What did I do?

362
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Stop!

363
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Stop!

364
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I'll be strict with you.

366
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
What's with the look?

367
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
You always get in my way.

368
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
25 years ago,

369
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
because of you,

370
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Mikiyo and I

371
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
caused so much trouble.

372
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Trouble?

373
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Mikiyo was suspected!

374
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
You didn't forget, did you?

375
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Tatekoro.

376
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Listen.

377
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Listen.

378
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
I'm not the son of an otaku.

379
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
He's been following me.

380
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
He used to be.

381
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Will you stop?

382
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Thanks to you,

383
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
this event is over.

384
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Don't use him.

385
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Enagi-san,

386
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
you're participating in this event

387
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
on your own will.

388
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
You caused trouble.

389
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Right?

390
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
What did I cause trouble for?

391
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm going.

392
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Wait.

393
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
You!

394
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Stop!

395
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Police!

396
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Stop!

397
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Could it be

398
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Yashiro-san's son?

399
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Yes.

400
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
He's always been a big help to you.

401
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Thanks.

402
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I didn't know you'd be involved in this.

403
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
I'm grateful

404
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
for your help.

405
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
You're the one who asked me to do it.

406
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
I'm fine now.

407
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Sorry to bother you.

408
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Don't bother me again!

409
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm sorry.

410
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Kojima,

411
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,040
get the chair back.

412
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Hello?

413
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Do you have time tonight?

414
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
I have something to talk to you about.

415
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
It's okay.

416
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I have something to ask you.

417
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I might be getting a call from the police.

418
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Is it about the Tobashi case?

419
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I don't know.

420
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I don't know.

421
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
I don't know.

422
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Is it about the Tobashi case?

423
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Yes.

424
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
But don't worry.

425
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Here's what I'll say.

426
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
That woman was

427
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
in the middle of the investigation.

428
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
She gave us her name and

429
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
sent us a short message.

430
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
We don't know why.

431
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
If we answer that, it'll be over.

432
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
It's like a script.

433
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
It's not that bad.

434
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
It'll be settled.

435
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You helped out at the press conference.

436
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Mr. Igarashi.

437
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
It wasn't me.

438
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
My father's acquaintance helped me.

439
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Who?

440
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
The president of a construction company called Nakabashi.

441
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
They're re-inviting it in Hatano.

442
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
My father is also helping out

443
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
with the re-invitation.

444
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
That's too much.

445
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
It's not like that.

446
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
My father did it for you.

447
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
It's for myself.

448
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
My father is a great man.

449
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Mr. Igarashi.

450
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
What do you want?

451
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
I want you to investigate a person.

452
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Who?

453
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
The head of the Hatano Prefecture.

454
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Tadokoro Miki.

455
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Tadokoro Miki

456
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Tadokoro Miki

457
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Why are you wearing a bag?

458
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Who are you talking about?

459
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
25 years ago.

460
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
After the Kotone incident.

461
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,040
What did Tadokoro do?

462
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
He studied in the US.

463
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I've been thinking about that for a long time.

464
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Nakano-Ura City, Ibaraki Prefecture.

465
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Nakani 34-5.

466
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Sunehara Hospital.

467
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
It's a mental hospital.

468
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Tadokoro was hospitalized for 3 years.

469
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
He said he killed a dead body in the hospital.

470
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
He was making a scene.

471
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
To be exact.

472
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
He killed a person who looked like a dead body.

473
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Why are you wearing a bag?

474
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Because you're friends?

475
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Or because you're a accomplice?

476
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Why are you making a scene about that?

477
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Tadokoro was hospitalized for mental illness.

478
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
He didn't study in the US.

479
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
He was hospitalized for mental illness.

480
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
He was hospitalized for mental illness.

481
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
He's just a student.

482
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Don't tell anyone about this.

483
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Take it to the grave.

484
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Don't tell anyone that Tadokoro was the last person Mio met.

485
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
I'll explain what this means.

486
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Tadokoro was hospitalized for mental illness.

487
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
He was hospitalized for mental illness.

488
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
He was hospitalized for mental illness.

489
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
He was hospitalized for mental illness.

490
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
He was hospitalized for mental illness.

491
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
I'm the last person Mio met.

492
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm the one who's protecting him.

493
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
That's all.

494
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Are you serious?

495
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
You think I'm serious about catching Tadokoro with this information?

496
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
The evidence is...

497
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
The evidence that Tadokoro killed Kotone and Mio...

498
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
The evidence that Tadokoro killed Kotone and Mio...

499
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
The evidence that Tadokoro killed Kotone and Mio...

500
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Where is the evidence that I'm the accomplice?

501
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Where is it?

502
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Tell me! Where is it?

503
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I know you're desperate.

504
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I know you're desperate.

505
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
You're burning up.

506
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
The woman you used to kill...

507
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
The woman you used to kill...

508
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
She's not a victim.

509
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
She's got a wife.

510
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
She's got a wife.

511
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
You can't do that?

512
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
You're back on your feet.

513
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
I left her to die for my dance.

514
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I left her to die for my dance.

515
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm responsible for this.

516
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm responsible for this.

517
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I have to do this for her.

518
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I have to do this for her.

519
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
So tell me.

520
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
So tell me.

521
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
What do you know?

522
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
What happened that day?

523
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Who killed Mio?

524
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Who killed Mio?

525
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Who killed Mio?

526
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Who killed Mio?

527
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Who killed Mio?

528
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Hello?

529
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Hello?

530
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
It's Yashiro.

531
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
He's a career man.

532
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
He's a career man.

533
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
He doesn't know the number.

534
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Hello?

535
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Hello?

536
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Hello?

537
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Is this Yashiro?

538
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Yes.

539
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm Mio's father.

540
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I'm Mio's father.

541
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes.

542
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
What is it?

543
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I'd like to meet you and talk about it.

544
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
I'd like to meet you and talk about it.

545
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I'd like to meet you and talk about it.

546
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes.

547
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Yes.

548
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Hiroki.

549
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
What are you doing?

550
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Sit down.

551
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
I need to use the bathroom.

552
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm sorry for calling you

553
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
when you're busy.

554
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

555
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

556
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

557
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

558
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

559
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

560
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

561
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

562
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

563
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

564
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

565
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

566
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

567
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

568
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

569
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,740
I'm sorry for calling you when you're busy.

570
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,240
So you want me to take over the company?

571
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Yes.

572
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I wouldn't believe Shoko.

573
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:42,040
But I don't think the investigation is progressing.

574
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,040
They didn't tell me anything.

575
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
I'm sorry.

576
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,040
You're a career, aren't you?

577
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Yes.

578
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I heard you're an excellent detective.

579
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Please.

580
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Mio is a single daughter.

581
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,040
She was my life.

582
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
But...

583
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,040
I don't know if she's alive or dead.

584
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,040
I don't know anything.

585
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Could you please investigate?

586
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Please.

587
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Please.

588
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
I understand.

589
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Then, let's start with the day she disappeared.

590
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Mr. Yasuhiro.

591
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Wait.

592
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Are you investigating?

595
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Yes.

596
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
I'm a reference.

597
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,040
You're not an investigator, are you?

598
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
So what?

599
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
You said it, didn't you?

600
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
You're a life and safety officer.

601
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
You're in charge of something else.

602
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Of course I know.

603
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll do it on my own.

604
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,040
I can't leave it to the investigators.

605
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm investigating because I want to.

606
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,040
After that, you went to Ringo's store, didn't you?

607
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Yes.

608
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
What time was it?

609
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Around 9.

610
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,040
When I went to the store, everyone was there.

611
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,040
I was busy, so I helped out a little.

612
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,040
What time did you go home?

613
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Around 11.

614
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
I see.

615
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Hiroeki.

616
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,040
I thought Mio was asleep.

617
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
So I went to sleep.

618
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Did you hear anything in the morning?

619
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,040
Until Togashi and I knocked on the door?

620
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
No.

621
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm sorry.

622
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Where's the stuff you lost?

623
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
My cell phone.

624
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Everything else was in the room.

625
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Your wallet and bag?

626
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Yes.

627
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,040
You really lost nothing?

629
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Think about it.

630
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
By the way...

631
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
What?

632
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,040
It's nothing special.

633
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
A towel?

634
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
A towel?

635
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
A green towel.

636
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Ringo gave it to me.

637
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
It's gone.

638
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
I always tied it to this handle.

639
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
What kind of towel?

640
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
A normal green towel.

641
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
I gave it to Mio.

642
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,040
When Mio went missing,

643
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,040
you must have gone home around 11.

644
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
Yes.

645
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Are you suspecting someone else?

646
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
That's my job.

647
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,040
What a sad job.

648
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,040
You should suspect Ringo too.

649
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,040
If you want to find your mother.

650
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
What do you mean?

651
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,040
You can't trust people.

652
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
You mean me?

653
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,040
You're still suspecting Togashi?

654
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
Yes.

655
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Welcome, Mr. Yanagi.

656
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I found it.

657
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
A towel.

658
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,040
I forgot to wash it.

659
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,040
It was dirty.

660
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,040
I washed it.

661
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I found it.

662
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I thought I'd clean it before Mio came back.

663
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,040
This towel?

664
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,040
It was her favorite.

665
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Ringo.

666
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
This...

667
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,040
I wonder if Katami will take it.

668
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Hiroyuki.

669
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,040
Katami?

670
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,040
She won't come back.

671
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,040
She won't come back.

672
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Mio...

673
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,040
She's dead.

674
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,040
Mr. Yanagi, please sit.

675
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,040
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,040
The power's on.

678
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
Mio's phone.

679
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
Did you tell your friend?

680
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
Yes.

681
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,040
I didn't tell her I'm dead.

682
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,040
You can't do that anymore.

683
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
What's wrong?

684
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Mr. Yanagi.

685
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
What?

686
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
What is it?

687
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,040
What's going on?

688
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,040
What happened?

689
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,040
What's going on?

690
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,040
What's going on?

691
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,040
What's going on?

692
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,040
What's going on?

693
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,040
What's going on?

694
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,040
What's going on?

695
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,040
What's going on?

696
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,040
What's going on?

697
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,040
What's going on?

698
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,040
What's going on?

699
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,040
I don't want to go home early.

700
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,040
What's wrong?

701
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
I don't want to see my father.

702
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,040
Did something happen?

703
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,040
I'm getting goosebumps.

704
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,040
What's going on?

705
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,040
What's going on?

706
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,040
What's going on?

707
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,040
What's going on?

708
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,040
Mio!

709
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,040
Mio, don't come back.

710
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,040
I don't care who the culprit is.

711
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
I hope he's safe.

712
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,040
If he kills me, I want you to catch him.

713
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
I'll take care of you.

714
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Riko is in danger!

715
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Riko, are you okay?

716
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,040
I'm fine.

717
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,040
He has been got myself into trouble.

718
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,040
I've been cats for long.

719
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,040
Riko is to blame.

720
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,040
I can't imagine how you can bear it.

721
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,040
I love you.

722
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,040
Good morning?

723
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,040
Good morning?

724
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

725
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

726
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

727
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

728
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

729
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

730
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

731
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

732
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

733
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

734
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

735
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

736
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

737
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

738
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

739
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

740
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

741
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

742
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

743
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

744
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

745
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

746
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

747
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

748
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

749
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

750
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

751
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
