00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,330
There's no need to worry about me.

165
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,040
I have you two, and that's enough.

170

Do you still remember...

171
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,150
what you said to me that day when we were at the batting cages?

172
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,200
You were afraid that you couldn't follow me around everywhere.

173
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,570
You were afraid that the more you liked me,

174
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,990
the further I'd be away from you.

175
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,870
And you were afraid that we wouldn't be able to return to how things were.

176
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,720
You told me, we'd face the future together.

177
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,150
But I can't see a future for us.

178
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,220
I've thought about it a lot,

179
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,580
but at least we can still be best friends and brothers.

180
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,430
Brothers?

181
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,780
Yes.

182
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,700
Regardless of what happens, I will always be your brother.

Being with you...

187
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,420
felt like I had a good student's grades given to me by accident.

188
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,450
For a split second,

189
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,480
I felt like I held the whole world in my hands.

190

This is over, but we'll still have our own futures.

No problem, I'm not in a hurry.

215
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,810
Yuki brought all of this here.

216
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,910
He knows that I like to brew coffee,

217
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,330
so he grabbed a small table, chairs, and utensils.

218
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,050
They're...

219
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,390
Just here for the time being.

220
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,160
The laundromat must stay open.

221
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,550
Did you want to grab Lawyer Zheng's clothes as well?

222
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,580
Sure. Sorry to bother you.

223
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,480
I think this is pretty good.

224
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,420
I think that combining a coffee shop with a laundromat is a pretty good idea.

225
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,230
Oh, she's done. She's out of class by now.

226
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,930
- Dad.
- Hey.

227
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,210
Hi.

228
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,710
And this is...?

229
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,480
Didn't you say that you'd already thrown them away?

230
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,360
Brother Yuki collected them and brought them back,

231
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,220
but I told him there was no need for that. He didn't listen to me.

232
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,710
Ling Ling, go and change your clothes first,

233
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,960
then we'll all have dinner together in a bit. Okay?

234
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,680
All right. Let's go.

235
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,310
You go ahead and wait for me. Okay?

236
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,810
All right.

237
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,580
I shouldn't have thrown away these clothes without asking you about them first.

238
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,570
I'm sorry, I could only recover these pieces.

239
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,860
It's okay.

240
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,280
I made a mistake, too.

241
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,830
Perhaps, these clothes... will never be picked up by anyone.

242
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,560
I just think it's really a pity.

243
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,420
They were just thrown away.

244
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,320
However, I also shouldn't have betrayed your good intentions.

245
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,850
Are you... willing to forgive me?

246
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
Are you willing to hand these clothes over to me?

247
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,270
So you two are... done then?

248
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,060
Did he agree to the breakup?

249
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,720
I've decided to go on a blind date.

250
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,080
I know that he and I both have our own individual paths to continue on.

251
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,140
But I don't know how to forget him.

252
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,480
Every morning... and every afternoon...

253
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,590
and every night.

254
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,110
I remember his enchanting and charming smile.

255
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,860
- Hey, I'm not ready yet.
- No problem, let's just take one more.

256
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,920
Here, I'll give you another chance.

257
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,230
Three... two... one...

258
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,740
You didn't look at the camera.

259
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,850
I think it's cute. Come on, let's take one more.

260
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,020
Three... two... one...

261
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,260
When you discover that what wakes you up every day,

262
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,040
isn't your alarm clock,

263
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,430
but rather, the reality that he has already left...

264
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:35,170
Perhaps, we should all raise up our glass and cheers to this cute and annoying love.

265
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,760
You're really not yourself today. You've become quite talkative.

266
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,520
I don't know who I am anymore.

267
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,510
- Lawyer Fu, long time no see!
- Hello.

268
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm really sorry about last time.

269
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
The last time truly scared me.

270
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,880
I wondered how lawyers could end up doing such a thing.

271
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,260
Fortunately, you've returned.

272
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,760
However, I see that you are very nice and polite.

273
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,320
And you wish to go on a blind date.

274
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,210
Are there no women that like you?

275
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,160
No.

276
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,500
Well, they're blind then.

277
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,940
However, let me tell you. You don't need to date those girls out there that are unsure of what they want.

278
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,390
The girls that I introduce to you will certainly be suitable.

279
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,100
But I do want to ask you. As a lawyer, are you very tired?

280
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,800
What I mean is, it's not important whether you're busy or not, I'm simply afraid that...

281
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,300
Hello, my name is Mr. Fu.

282
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,850
Nikita, what are you doing here?

283
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,110
Didn't you say that you hated going on blind dates?

284
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm very curious.

285
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,360
Why are you doing something that you don't enjoy?

286
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,430
People can change.

287
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,910
This is how I am today.

288
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,490
But I may be different tomorrow.

289
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,660
So are you... changing yourself...

290
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,790
because of him?

291
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,000
Yuki told me that day,

292
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,810
that he thought we were very similar.

293
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,480
Especially, in regards to emotions.

294
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,790
We are both the type of people...

295
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,570
who rush to find out the answer... when we are confused.

296
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,290
Have you found your answer?

297
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,530
Mr. Fu, hello.

298
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,820
And this is...?

299
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,330
I'm his girlfriend, hello.

300
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,770
What kind of game are you playing? You have a girlfriend and you're still going on blind dates?

301
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,670
Take care!

302
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,120
Why did you do that?

303
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,900
Didn't you say that life has no absolutes?

304
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,600
Please give me a chance, and go out with me.

305
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,850
Please give loving me a chance.

306
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,740
And please, try and forget about Zheng Zeshou.

307
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,620
I like you.

308
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,970
I want to become your answer.

309
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,530
I also think we're very similar.

310
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,040
Are you willing to change yourself for the one that you like?

311
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,090
I will change myself, for you.

312
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,810

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,970
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

323
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:57,000
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

324
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,590
♫ I wish you could feel how I feel ♫

Thank you for taking care of me for so long, Uncle Wang.
