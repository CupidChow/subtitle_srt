Mr. Zheng.

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,540
I said and discussed some matters before,

65
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,040
but my words were not directed against you two.

66
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,430
We are not born as fathers,

67
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,280
and we only encounter some matters after becoming fathers.

68
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,480
In regards to the situation with you all,

69
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,930
at the time, I really didn't know what to do or how to resolve the issue with you.

70
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,620
But I was thinking... your mother...

71
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,930
also wanted you two to be happy.

72
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,480
And she also hoped that you would have a happy family.

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,510
I'm sorry, Mr. Zheng.

74
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,840
I previously said...

75
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,190
that I was going to leave him, in order for him to be happier.

76
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,750
However, in the end, I thought...

77
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,690
we should both foster this happiness together.

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,180
Therefore, regardless of what happens...

79
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,870
I will certainly always be by Zheng Zeshou's side.

80

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,670
"Failure is the mother of success."

At any rate, we should celebrate.

Did your celebration have to be so small and impromptu?

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,820
There was no other option. All of the cake shops are closed by this time.

Here's my second wish:

I hope that Fu Ligong will forever love only one person,

107
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,140
and won't be snatched up by anyone else.

Did I not already tell you that the matter with Nikita was a misunderstanding?

109
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,810
All right. I need to find a good time to go and apologize to her.

No problem.

Lawyer Fu, that looks a nice set up there.

133
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,590
I went to take care of something important.

What do you mean?

135
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,610
Why didn't you remember that you have a case to handle?

136

I see, this is the famous 'nagging' behavior that men always talk about.

I've never been called that when I'd brought you lunches before.

Why are you being so deliberate today?

149

Here, Little Gong. This is yours.

150
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,870
Thank you, Mr. Zheng. However, why is there so much food?

151
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,300
No, it's not too much! You're so thin.

152
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,810
You need to eat a bit more.

153
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,040
If you want to eat anything else, just let me know.

154
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,070
Wait a minute. Why are our portions so different?

155
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,470
You can eat whatever you want at home. What are you bothering me about?

156
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,070
So who exactly is your son then?

157
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,920
All right. Let's eat, everyone!

158
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,550
You're still here.

159
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,950
I think it'll look nicer if I leave this here.

I lost the white rose that you gave me before.

161
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,240
It was very unlucky.

162
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,860
Fortunately, we found our lost love again.

163
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,180
You always sit at that table and eat breakfast.

164
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,800
We sat on that couch, ate popcorn, and watched series together.

165
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,250
We cuddled together, and fell asleep here,

166
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,480
And had our first time together.

167
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,330
And you laid out those roses in the shape of the character for "Earth" on the bed.

168
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,240
It wasn't the character for Earth! It was a plus and minus sign.

169
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,260
The plus sign represents me, Zheng Zeshou.

170
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,190
And the minus sign represents you, Fu Ligong.

171
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,350
That's what you told me.

172
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,270
When I think about it carefully, it's a little corny.

173
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,830
I think... it was very romantic.

174
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,210
I hope that our love will be a romantic series,

175
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,140
and that there will be many seasons.

176
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,980
But I believe, in the end, there will certainly be a very happy ending.

177
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,890
Well then, I hope that this drama will be broadcasted for a hundred years.

178
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,250
And I will spend those one hundred years...

179
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,830
remembering every moment that we've spent together.

180
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,050
Close your eyes.

181
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,010
Fu Ligong.

182
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,570
Do you want to be the male lead in this story?

183
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,350
Although this story may end perfectly each episode,

184
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,270
there may be bloopers, and we may forget our lines sometimes,

185
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,490
but I will certainly try my very best

186
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,070
to make every scene as sweet and beautiful as possible.

187
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,370
Will you spend the rest of your life

188
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,660
in this drama with me?

189
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,970
♫ Even if the world returns to 0 on this day ♫

190
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,300
♫ A one plus minus one adventure ♫

191
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,860
♫ A declaration that adds up to love ♫

192
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,230
♫ As day and night circle... ♫

193
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,070
Yes.

194
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,630
♫ You are the best solution ♫

195
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,510
♫ No more bypassing the stars and the moon ♫

196
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,650
♫ Back at the house where we met ♫

197
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,630
"My fathers, I have two of them.

198
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,040
One is my "passerby" father.

199
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,680
The other is my "famous star" father.

200
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,330
Although my father and mother have divorced,

201
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,210
they are still great friends.

202
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,380
And they love me very much.

203
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,050
Father opened up a laundromat.

204
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,560
He was very much a "passerby" and ordinary person before,

205
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,890
He leads a very ordinary life.

206
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,770
Until he met a great and famous star.

207
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,900
From this point on, he no longer plays a supporting role.

208
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,480
He also has his own dream.

209
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,170
Now, our family has opened up a coffee shop.

210
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,940
Besides providing laundry services, the shop also sells coffee.

211
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,880
I have two fathers.

212
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,370
One is my "passerby" father. I love him very much.

213
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,730
The other is my "famous star" father.

214
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,300
He loves my dad very much.

215
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,110
When we're hand-in-hand,

216
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,240
We have the sweetest and most comforting family."

217
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,930
Do you think I look nice?
[I Suit]

218
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,200
Will it be too tight?

219
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,750
Did we leave out anyone on our wedding invitation list?

220
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,650
I always feel like we've forgotten someone.

221
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,480
We didn't invite a lot of people, remember?

222
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,090
And the thank you cards?

223
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,070
After we finish trying on the suits, are we going to go and take the wedding pictures?

224
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,990
And we need to write the thank you cards.

225
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,550
We still have a lot of time.

226
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,020
Have you thought about whose home we'll live in after we get married?

227
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,560
I haven't thought about it, but...

228
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,540
I think we can move into a bigger place together.

229
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,780
Is it the right decision for us to get married?

230
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,620
What I mean is...

231
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,870
Is it the right decision for us to get married so soon?

232
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,060
I really want to be with you.

233
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,290
I also really want to be with you.

234
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm very anxious.

235
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,400
How about we go and talk about some of these things over with your dad?

236
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,740
No, we can't. He'll kill me.

237
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,750
Actually, I'm really very happy to marry you.

238
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,980
It's just that, as we get closer to the date, I'm getting more anxious and scared.

239
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,260
I'm scared that I don't really want to get married.

240
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,300
I'm afraid that I'll hurt you.

241
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,720
How about we find a place that will put you at ease.

242
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,550
At... ease?

243
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,580
My father's restaurant? We can't.

244
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,010
How did you come up with that place?

245
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,280
I know of a place that you will definitely like.

246
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,840
Brother, tell me a little bit about how you feel.

247
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,340
What does getting married mean to you?

248
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,780
Getting married...

249
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,160
I think it's one thing to meet someone and fall in love with them,

250
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,700
and I think that continuing to love the other person, is another matter entirely.

251
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,050
And it's an even greater thing to enter into a marriage.

252
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,220
Getting married requires a lot of mental and emotional preparation.

253
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,690
You need to be absolutely sure.

254
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,540
Zheng Zeshou, do you think that you're giving a speech?

255
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,180
Yes, I'm actually going to enter a competition.

256
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,800
Fine, you look very handsome. Today, you're the most handsome here. Okay?

257
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,160
Well, I always look better than you. And you don't know whether you'll have the chance to wear a wedding dress or not.

258
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,670
Dad, do you see what he's saying?

259
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,490
Oh, you two.

260
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,070
Forget about it. I'm going to go and take a picture of Fu Ligong.

261
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,010
- Wow, you look so handsome!
- I definitely need to get a picture of this!

262
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,470
Nonsense, but also, don't look at my husband.

263
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,250
Don't be fussy, I've already finished putting on makeup.

264
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,680
Brother Fu Ligong, how about you? What does marriage mean to you?

265
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,480
It's a true beginning.

266
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,900
Once the officiant signs the marriage certificate,

267
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,050
one gains a new set of responsibilities.

268
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,940
In fact, once one puts the trivial matters of marriage to the wayside,

269
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,220
marriage is actually very simple.

270
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,620
But the most difficult part is figuring out how to keep it going.

271
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,570
And to prevent the marriage contract from becoming the pain of both people.

272
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,280
Ligong, you're so touching.

273
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,180
Do you want to consider putting my brother to the side

274
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,130
and finding a better man?

275
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Two newcomers! Come and have your pictures taken!

276
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,600
Great.

277
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,960
That's pretty good.

278
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,440
Come, be a little more intimate!

279
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,680
Oh, a little bit more intimate? Is this intimate enough?

280
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,160
Yes, that's great.

281
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,860
Great, you can rest for a bit.

282
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,550
And there's also...

283
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,210
I'm more tired than I expected.

284
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,460
You're tired? We're only taking pictures.

285
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,400
Your marriage hasn't even started yet.

286
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,440
You seem to have a lot of experience with marriage.

287
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,500
Yes.

288
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,090
Once you actually get married, then you'll know.

289
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,780
You'll regret it.

290
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,220
You'll regret not getting married sooner.

291
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,060
Dad, let's all take a picture together!

292
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,890
Come, come.

293
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,460
- Should we sit in the chair?
- Yes, yes.

294
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,340
Yes, sit in those two chairs.

295
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,970
Great, everyone smile!

296
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,650
Look at the camera. One,

297
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,160
Two... Three...

298
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,140
- Get a bit closer, you two.
- Is this intimate enough?

299
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,190
Yes, that's great.

300
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,290
Dad, if you're okay with it, you can do that too.

301
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,160
Okay, yes. We're very close to each other.

302
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,340
Is that enough?

303
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,020
- Is this okay?
- One, two, three.

304
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,750
All right, one more! One, two.

305
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,020
Smile!

306
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,500
Are you still sorting out some of the wedding details?

307
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,360
We really should have had a wedding planning company manage this from the beginning.

308
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,510
You're the one who said you wanted to manage it yourself.

309
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,780
You should have stopped me.

310
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,560
But I saw that a certain someone was having a great time managing it all.

311
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,840
So, I didn't feel comfortable stopping you.

312
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,900
♫ Whose tears are these? ♫

313
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,190
♫ They are your footsteps and my coffee ♫

314
00:23:53,190 --> 00:24:01,150
♫ The sky tells me that the story exists ♫

315
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,660

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,930
♫ Afraid that you will come back ♫

317

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:20,030
♫ Eighteen years old yesterday with you ♫

319
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:28,230
♫ Have your umbrella,
relying on the yellowing of the railway platform ♫

320
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,060
♫ Don't talk, don't listen, don't look ♫

321
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:43,160
♫ The letter contains the warmth of that year ♫

322
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,860
♫ The shattered youth have been sent to your door ♫

323
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,450
♫ Under the sound of rain,
I have heard the familiar vulnerability ♫

324
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:07,890
♫ The dismantled phone booth
loves being dismantled by the wind ♫

325
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,080
Dr. Tu, what are you doing here?

326
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,520
- Lawyer Fu invited me to come.
- Really?

327
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,380
- Dr. Tu.
- Hi!

328
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,080
- I really like you.
- Thank you.

329
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,460
- I really like you.
- I really like you, too.

330
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,270
Thank you for your support.

331
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,610
You look very nice in this outfit.

332
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,380
So... when will it be our turn?

333
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,860
Ling Ling, will you be nervous today?

334
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,270
No, this is a small stage.

335
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,530
I can play for your wedding when you two get married as well.

336
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,350
Really?

337
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,630
Ling Ling, in the future, when we get married, we'll ask you to play then.

338
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,920
Yingze, come with me to the back while I'll grab some salvo. Okay?

339
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,000
All right. Wait for me, I'll be right back.

340
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,670
Fu Ligong, you look so handsome today!

341
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,880
And you're wearing a black tie! This flower is great, too!

342
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,590
Don't mess it up. My apologies.

343
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,680
This was a special wedding, so we invited you without much prior notice.

344
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,520
You're always so polite. We know each other quite well, don't we?

345
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,410
How could I possibly miss my older brother's wedding?

346
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,740
But I'm afraid that I'm going to cry in a little bit. What will I do?

347
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,380
You're exaggerating. Here, let me introduce you. This is my husband's friend.

348
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,110
You're not even married yet, and you're already calling him your husband.

349
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,440
Hello, my name is A'Zhi.

350
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,130
Xia En! Xia En!

351
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,870
My heart is racing.

352
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,920
- Oh, I'm so sorry. My name is Xia En.
- Hello.

353
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,850
Lawyer Fu, can I borrow you for a few minutes?

354
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,100
Well, I'll leave you two to talk then. I'm going to go take care of a few things.

355
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,730
All right.

356
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,110
Take your time.

357
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,580
Hello.

358
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,110
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,990
Have we met before?

360
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,820
No, I don't think so.

361
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,270
Why does it feel like we have?

362
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,060
It feels like we've met before.

363
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,090
- Well, should we exchange contact information then?
- All right.

364
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,980
Have you used CATCHPLAY+?

365
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,500
What's going on? What has your brother said to you?

366
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,770
He hasn't answered me.

367
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,040
- Is he on a plane or something?
- Don't be anxious, Zheng.

368
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,980
- Maybe he was delayed for some reason.
- It will be fine.

369
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,170
Who is the star of the show today?

370
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,110
- Never mind.
- You go on ahead.

371
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,430
- The ceremony and process will roughly be like this, it should be no problem.
- Thank you.

372
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,700
Lawyer Zheng isn't here yet.

373
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,380
- Are you scared?
- What would I be scared of?

374
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,070
Scared that my husband will run away?

375
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,040
My eyes are going blind, quickly.

376
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,690
Dad, Brother is here!

377
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,920
Groom, how dare you be late?

378
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,930
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

379
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,510
There are so many things you need to apologize for.

380
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,530
I'm truly sorry about what happened before.

381
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,310
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,200
All right, go on and get married.

383
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,770
You really think you're a big deal, huh?

384
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,150
Everyone's waiting for you. You're finally here.

385
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,700
Although I'm late, I'm here.

386
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,960
Regardless of what happens, I'll still make my grand appearance.

387
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,270
You're so silly! Go ahead and get ready!

388
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,850
- I'll go and greet the other guests.
- Go ahead.

389
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,210
- Why were you late?
- I forgot to grab something important.

390
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,100
These, the witnesses to our love.

391
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,020
Firstly, let's welcome the best men!

Mr. Fu Ligong.

403
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,860
Do you agree to be each other's partners?

404
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,130
In sickness and in health, and until death do you part?

405
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,060
For richer or poorer,

406
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,620
and to stay together forever, and never give up?

407
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,140
I do.

408
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,570

- Please exchange rings.
