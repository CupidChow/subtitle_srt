163
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,137
Exactly. But Gong, we're still really looking forward to your cross-dressing.

164
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,774
Good luck!

165
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,535
Come closer.

166
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,941
You're adorable with makeup, too.

167
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:05,410
It's okay. It's okay.

168
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,357
Oh, God, Zheng Zeshou!

169
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,592
Why are you dressed like that?

170
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,895
I'm participating in the cross-dressing contest with you.

171
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,197
Do you think I want to do this?

172
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,967
So, you just did this for me?

173
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,873
Yes, isn't this your most hated memory?

174
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,941
But I haven't started yet.

175
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,243
Why would it be a memory?

176
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:41,079
I'm afraid it'll be the memory you hate the most.

177
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,451
You two are so adorable.

178
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,988
Here's the makeup.

179
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,389
Good luck with it.

180
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,524
Just take it.

181
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,626
The two of you are a great couple.

182
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,299

I'm just going with you.

194
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,896
Come on, let me do your makeup.

195
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:31,797
That's not necessary.

196
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,832
Don't move.

197
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,933

This looks pretty nice.

204
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,802
This isn't your gift for me, right?

205
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,805
Aren't you drunk?

206
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,180
This is the gift you meant to give me.

207
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,897
Plus represents me.

208
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,232
Minus represents you.

209
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,209
When the two pendants unite,

210
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,112

Do you have a headache?

222
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,000
So, it was just a dream.

223
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,970

Yu even sent me photos of you during the cross-dressing contest in high school.

244

Is it right to do that to a high school student?
