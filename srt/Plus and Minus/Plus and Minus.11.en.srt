Please give me a chance, and go out with me.

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,610
Are you willing to change yourself for the one that you like?

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,790
I will change myself, for you.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,140
Nikita.

Fu Ligong!

31
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,240
Thank you for liking me!

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,430
I really and truly...

33
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,250
like you!

38
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,090
I will always be by Zeshou's side.

39

♫ I don't have any memories in your world ♫

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:04,500

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,790
♫ It would be nice if you told me, "I love you." ♫

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,760
If you want to turn me down, you can just tell me.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,310
Or... are you not good at turning people down?

44
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,100
Are you used to waiting until others give up first?

45
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,130
I'm not the type of person that is afraid of getting hurt.

46
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,980
At least I said what I wanted to today,

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,470
I don't want to have any regrets.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,820
Or perhaps... because you've just recently hurt someone,

49
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,060
you don't dare do it again?

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,810
I really like that look in your eyes right now.

51
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,280
Love is more painful than despair

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,910
because one always has hope.

53
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,510
Okay, now that I no longer have that hope,

54
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,290
I'm going to continue to seek out my answer.

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,350
What about you?

56
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,390
Don't go on anymore blind dates.

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,820
Even if you go on a million more blind dates,

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,980
you still will not find your answer.

59
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,010
Thank you for helping me escape that blind date.

60
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,430
You are very lucky to have met someone you really like,

61
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,840
who happens to also really like you.

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,810
Perhaps there are some factors in between you two that others aren't aware of.

63
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,030
But if you cannot forget about them,

64
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,450
then simply face them together.

65
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,560
Bye-bye.

66
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,970
Another round!

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,370
Do you want to stop and rest for the day?

68
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,080
Rest? Why?

69
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
It's still so early, and you have to close up the shop?

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,790
Please! Another round, okay?

71
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,880
You've already had a lot to drink.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,610
I haven't had enough yet.

73
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,200
That's not our most beautiful bar owner, Nikita, is it?

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,270
Why did you get here so late today? Were you on a date?

75
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,690
What's going on?

76
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,250
He's been drinking from the time we opened until now.

77
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll take care of this. Go and tidy up.

78
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,010
Do you want to have a drink with me?

79
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,600
You're in love, and my relationship has just ended.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
We can celebrate together!

81
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,270
We've already closed up shop. Please head home.

82
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,730
I saw everything.

83
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,510
It's fine. Fu Ligong and I have broken up.

84
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,550
Although I will be sad for a while,

85
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,200
seeing him find another partner so quickly

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,620
makes me truly happy for him.

87
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,780
What are you saying?

88
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,700
Don't be like that, Nikita.

89
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,210
Oh, that's not right.

90
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,630
I should call you "sister-in-law."

91
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,880
Fu Ligong is my brother.

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,270
After you start dating him, I should call you "sister-in-law," that's the correct term!

93
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,080
You self-righteous bastard!

94
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,740
What are you calling me "sister-in-law" for?

95
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,890
You keep on saying that you love Fu Ligong.

96
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,630
Do you know what he's thinking? Do you truly know what he's thinking about?

97
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,350
Let me tell you!

98
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,600
Even though he and I are not together now,

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,140
I still don't think that you are the right person to love him!

100
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,770
Thank you.

101
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,070
Do you have something on your mind?

102
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,570
No, I'm fine.

103
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,060
May I... respectfully ask you a question?

104
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,470
Yes.

105
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,430
You and your ex-husband... were together for over thirty years.

106
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,750
And during that time, there were no quarrels or instances of infidelity.

107
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,470
In the end, why did you decide to divorce?

108
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,820
A few months ago,

109
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,360
one day, I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night.

110
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,440
And I had a thought in my mind,

111
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,050
I wanted to get a divorce.

112
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,550
I suddenly realized that he and I had been married for over thirty years,

113
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,100
and that our marriage should come to an end.

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,780
Did you not have a thought that you wanted to work hard and continue to give it a try?

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,260
I've tried out all of the methods to save a marriage.

116
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,210
But I discovered afterward, that I didn't love him anymore.

117
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,100
Do you know that kind of feeling?

118
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,600
The feeling when the one that you've loved before...

119
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720
is already gone.

120
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,230
And you no longer like him anymore.

121
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,270
Going forward, do you have any plans?

122
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,050
I still have so many things that I haven't done yet.

123
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,470
I want to go abroad.

124
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,680
I want... the freedom to learn new things.

125
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,590
I want to live for myself.

126
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,380
I've already kept what's best for him in mind for a while,

127
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
and that's enough.

128
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,450
And this is...?

129
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,530
Although she said she doesn't want anything

130
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,830
and that I only need to sign the divorce papers,

131
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,560
I think it's a matter of responsibility and morality. And I think...

132
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,570
this is what I should do.

133
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,400
When she was young, she said that she wanted to go and study abroad.

134
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,450
And I think that this amount of money can help her.

135
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,180
Therefore, you want us to transfer this on your behalf.

136
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,860
Mr. Song, I think you should give it to her in person.

137
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,730
I know her personality too well.

138
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,150
When I saw that she was so determined to get a divorce before, I...

139
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,870
thought that I shouldn't press her any further.

140
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,370
Who knew that after thirty years of peace and stability,

141
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,690
we would still come to this point?

142
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,150
Perhaps, this will be a fresh start.

143
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,750
Perhaps.

144
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,180
After getting a divorce,

145
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,390
I discovered that everyone should take a close look

146
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,610
at themselves during normal times.

147
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,210
Everyone should cherish the person they are with at that moment.

148
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,400
This is a rare fate.

149
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,100
If we were to divorce one day, would you still wish to be friends?

150
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,700
No.

151
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,020
Because I would do absolutely anything

152
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,180
to save our love.

153
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,300
Being with you...

154
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,970
felt like I received a good student's grades by accident.

155
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,880
For a split second,

156
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,950
I felt like I held the whole world in my hands.

157
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,940
Fu Ligong.

158
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,410
As long as I live, I will never forget your love.

159
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,640
Are you serious about this relationship?

160
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,510

What I mean to say, is that I can take care of myself.

I'll still be by your side.

It's just that... our relationship needs to change.

we can still be friends. We'll always be best friends.

You've already made many sacrifices to hold onto these memories.

All I did was organize these clothes.

And let these forgotten clothes be seen once more.

187

I think this is the best thing for these clothes.

Actually, Little Gong told me about what happened between you two.

Originally, I thought he was trying to persuade me.

270
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,530
He interrupted me before I was finished speaking.

271
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,540
And he said that he was going to break up with you.

How did it all end up like this?

He said he was going to explain it to you himself.

He said...

275
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,480
He said that you really cared about us.

276
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,330
He said that you don't want to hurt anyone.

277

He said you...

278
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,190
that you pretend that you don't care about many things.

279
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,140
In fact, he actually secretly keeps these things in his mind and heart.

280
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,920
And then he uses his own methods to process them.

281
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,710
He always says that his name is Zheng Zeshou,

282
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,330
and that the character for his name, is the same as the character for "protect."

283
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,630
Because he wants to protect everyone that he cares about.

284
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,260
That's just how he is. He's always thinking about others.

285
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,550
Although his ways of thinking are a bit extreme sometimes.

286
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,740
And sometimes, he is even unable to fully control his own emotions.

287
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,870
So, he will talk back.

288
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,740
However, he is actually a very gentle and soft person.

289
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,900
Perhaps, because he is this way,

290
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,820
he did not reject me when I first confessed my feelings to him.

291
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,900
However, rest assured, Mr. Zheng.

292
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,270
I will always be his brother and his friend.

293
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,530
I will forever be his brother.

And I'll let him return to his original life.

nothing else matters.

I'll just say these few words.

303
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,490
Think more about yourself.

304

Don't get stuck in your own head and forget to act for yourself.

I've realized this.

Happiness is already right in front of you.

307
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,400
You need to realize that happiness will not fail for no reason.

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,590
You need to rely upon yourself and pursue what you want.

♫ As day and night circle, you are the best solution ♫

321
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,400
♫ No more bypassing the stars and the moon ♫

322
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,340
♫ Back to the house where we met ♫

323
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:55,420
♫ Even if the world gives up and reverses tomorrow ♫

324
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,980
♫ Just a little bit ♫

325
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,430
♫ You're back is crossing toward the horizon ♫

326
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,580
♫ Day and night ♫

327
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,070
♫ No more bypassing the stars and the moon ♫

328
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,080
♫ Beyond the still dream shimmering ♫

329
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,090
♫ Before the twilight and sea level rendevouz ♫

330
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,200
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

331
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,410
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

332
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,550
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

333
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,040
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

334
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,290
♫ I love you... ♫

335
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,480
♫ I miss you... ♫

336
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,700
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

337
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,650
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

338
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,620
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

339
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,980
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

340
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,970
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

341
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:48,390
♫ I wish you could feel how I feel ♫

342
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,910
