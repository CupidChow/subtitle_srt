You hate someone as deeply as you love them.

23

If we were to get a divorce one day,

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,890
would you still want to be my friend?

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,550
No.

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,110
Because I would do absolutely anything to save our love.

27
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,550
Well... do you want to get a drink with me tonight?

Yes.

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,980
I mixed this with buttercream.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,960
It's very sweet. Give it a try.

Mr. Jian.

32
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,620
Oh, it's Lawyer Zheng and Lawyer Fu.

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,500
This is the first time I've seen you come here.

34
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,440
Is it very strange?

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,600
No. It's just a rare occurrence.

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,400
Your glasses are dirty.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,360
And you guys are now...

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,490

Are you saying that Lawyer Zheng and Lawyer Fu...?

This is our second night of officially dating.

Amy!

42
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,650
Amy asked for today off from work.

43
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,010
Again? We have so much to take care of.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,220
Oh, that's right. Lawyer Zhen and Lawyer Fu,

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,640
- do you two like to go camping?
- Yes.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,550
Are you interested in going on a double date with us?

47
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll go anywhere you want to go.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,070
You two lawyers, would you like something to drink today?

Hey, baby.

Hi.

Do you want to do this today?

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,310
Do you feel like doing something with me today?

53
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,270
I want to have a bit of Zheng Zeshou tonight.

Dirt? It's the plus and minus signs together.

The plus sign represents me, Zheng Zeshou. The minus sign represents you, Fu Ligong.

And now, I'm just a backup lawyer.

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,290
But I could take out those two in one fell swoop.

Well, you'll have to keep working hard then.

How could the decor here be changed for the better?

109
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,550
Backup lawyer, someone is here.

110
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,550
Hello, miss. Who are you?

111
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm here to inquire about getting a divorce.

112
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,610
Did you call and make an appointment?

113
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,360
No, but I heard that this office was really good at this sort of thing,

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,400
so I immediately came here.

115
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,140
Hello, miss. You're here to inquire about getting a divorce?

116
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,590
Okay, come in then.

117
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,070
I apologize for not immediately responding to your request just now.

118
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,140
We usually inquire over the phone first,

119
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,180
and wait until the time has been confirmed before moving forward with the interview.

120
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,530
I made the decision to come too suddenly. I...

121
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,480
Just know that this office's divorce lawyers are very professional.

122
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,900
Therefore, I want to ask you all if you'll help me resolve this matter.

123
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,420
Thank you.

124
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Well, I want to ask you first, who are you inquiring on behalf of?

125
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,540
Myself...

126
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,020
I want to get a divorce.

127
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,960
I apologize. I just want to ask you.

128
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,450
What happened to cause you to make this decision?

129
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,320
For example, is this a matter of domestic violence?

130
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,790
No.

131
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,290
Or is your husband having an affair?

132
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,030
No.

133
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,310
Rather, are your finances unstable?

134
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,960
Do I have to... have some sort of particular reason to get a divorce?

135
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,040
This is how this matter usually proceeds, we must first understand the reasoning for the divorce,

136
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,710
so that we can figure out a plan and then coordinate on behalf of both parties.

137
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,540
I'll give you the example of domestic violence in a marriage.

138
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,100
In that situation, that case would very likely receive the judgment for divorce from a judge.

139
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
I'll give you a list of possible causes for divorce, and you can take a look.

140
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,470
It's not this complicated.

141
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,450
It's because I don't love him.

142
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,130
Therefore, has your husband also approached a lawyer about settling this matter?

143
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm the one who raised this issue. He won't sign the papers.

144
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,510
That's why I came here today to meet you

145
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,790
and to see if I could receive specialized assistance in this matter.

146
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,620
Is it really because you don't love him?

147
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,210
Yes.

148
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,230
I don't need his property.

149
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,530
My son and daughter already have their own jobs and can support themselves.

150
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,280
I have a pension myself. I don't need his money to support my lifestyle.

151
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,270
I just hope that you all can help me get a divorce.

152
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,820
So that I may live out my days how I please.

153
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,960
Understood.

154
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,080
All right, we understand.

155
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,020
Please sit down for a while.

156
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,760
Is something wrong?

157
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,390
No.

158
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,120
It's written all over your face, but you're still saying you're fine.

159
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,360
Is it because we agreed to take that woman's case?

160
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,460
No.

161
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,640
It's just my first time encountering a case like this.

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,060
She's been married for over thirty years, and she has no reason to want a divorce.

163
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, she does.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,480
Didn't she say she wants a divorce because she doesn't love him?

165
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,980
I've mentioned this before, being in love and being married are different.

166
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,710
Didn't you also say

167
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,550
that it's not our job to make judgments on cases?

168
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,650
Everyone has the capacity in their heart

169
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,270
to determine what they should and shouldn't do.

170
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,210
But we hold ourselves to our own standards, after all.

171
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,040
Perhaps...

172
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,590
we still don't fully understand this world.

173
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,740
It's fine. What I want to say is...

174
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,560
I think many matters go beyond the surface level.

175
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,500
This case is very out of the ordinary.

176
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,340
Perhaps it will provide us with a different perspective.

177
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,470
Do you want to find out the answer to this type of quandary?

178
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,020
I also don't quite understand it.

179
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,780
She's been married for more than thirty years,

180
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,370
and there are no external factors affecting this situation.

181
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,970
And in the end, she's chosen to get a divorce.

182
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,030
But I remember what you said. Our job...

183
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:21,810
Our job Is to help those who have already lost their lover and minimize their hurt.

184
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,180
I will always be in your corner.

185
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,120
And I'm Zheng Zeshou.

186
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,860
I'm telling you, Yuki.

187
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,020
Why would you want to go camping

188
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,810
with so much stuff?

189
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,270
Because Ling Ling likes to go stargazing.

190
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,870
Isn't that right?

191
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,920
I'll leave you two to the food, I'm going to go over there and set up our camp.

192
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,420
I feel like Yuki has changed a lot.

193
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,160
I've also changed quite a bit.

194
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,910
How?

195
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,080
I've changed and grown to love you even more.

196
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,340
Let's go and prepare the food.

197
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,390
Are you done putting up the tent?

198
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,540
Brother Yuki's finished putting up the other tent.

199
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,130
That was so fast.

200
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,120
Give me just a bit more time.

201
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,070
Why is it taking you so long? Do you want me to help you?

202
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm fine.

203
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,320
It's the place we're going to sleep, after all. I don't want to do a sloppy job.

204
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,600
It may be that I'm not as smart as you.

205
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,680
I'll be done in a moment.

206
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,240
My pillow!

207
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,060
Ling Ling, don't just run around carelessly!

208
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,690
Did I make some mistakes while putting up the tent?

209
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,930
Do you want to teach me how to do it?

210
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,830
I'm almost done cooking over here. How's your rice coming along, Fu Ligong?

211
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,420
Wait a moment.

212
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,130
What are you doing?

213
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,590
I'm cooking the rice.

214
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,710
What's the ratio for cups of water to rice?

215
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,140
One cup of rice... to four cups of water?

216
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,170
Are you saying that you should add four cups of water for every one cup of rice?

217
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,640
You can't cook rice like that.

218
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,840
You're used to eating out, you don't make rice yourself too often.

219
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,930
It seems that I've been going out to eat with you too often.

220
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,390
I've never cooked rice for myself before.

221
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,520
That's fine. In the future, I'll cook the rice and you can eat it.

222
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,820
What is this?

223
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,980
Seaweed and corn chowder.

224
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,320
Go ahead and help me set the table.

225
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,440
Well, I'll leave this to you then.

226
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,730
♫ Oh my baby, don't you, don't you wanna chase me? ♫

227
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,740
♫ You're my rabbit, I want to hold you tight ♫

228
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,870
♫ You're my baby, the alarm keeps ringing all because of you ♫

229
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,530
Dinner is served!

230
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,770
Wow!

231
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,870
Wait a minute.

232
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,620
- Here's a little bit of tomato to try.
- Give Ling Ling some vegetables.

233
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,940
- All right.
- What did you use to make this?

234
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,290
This? Well, let me tell you, I... bought this macron.

235
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,930
♫ What? What do I not have? ♫

236
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,220
♫ Let it go, love is in your hands ♫

237
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,240
♫ Ask me directly, speak out ♫

238
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,460
♫ I love you more and more and more ♫

239
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,570
♫ Oh my baby, don't you, don't you wanna chase me? ♫

240
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,590
♫ You're my rabbit, I want to hold you tight ♫

241
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,030
♫ You're my baby, the alarm keeps ringing all because of you ♫

242
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,670
♫ Don't be shy anymore ♫

243
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,510
♫ It's getting out of control, where do I hide? ♫

244
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,870
♫ My heart is beating, who dares to cross this line first? ♫

245
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,210
♫ Day and night, who said there were rules? ♫

246
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,040
Is Ling Ling asleep?

247
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,050
Yes, she's really tired after today.

248
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,450
She said she wanted to gaze at the stars. But now she's fallen asleep without even seeing them.

249
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,170
Here.

250
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,760
Thank you.

251
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,810
I haven't been camping in a long time.

252
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,470
I still remember the last time we went camping during college.

253
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,810
Are you talking about our graduation trip?

254
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,770
Fortunately, a certain someone wasn't cooking that time.

255
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,150
Lawyer Zhen and Lawyer Fu, how did you meet Ying Ze?

256
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,270
You didn't meet each other at the laundromat, did you?

257
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,320
We...

258
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,960
We met each other when I was getting divorced from my ex-wife.

259
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,730
His ex-wife brought the case to us;

260
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,360
however, I thought it was a mutual consent divorce.

261
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,250
But he came to our office

262
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,690
because there were custody issues.

263
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:47,170
But the interesting thing was Mr. Jian told us "thank you."

264
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,960
That was the first time I'd encountered someone getting a divorce and thanking me.

265
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,140
Afterward, we frequently brought our clothes to the laundromat and became closer.

266
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,110
I really wanted to thank you for helping me resolve that matter, Lawyer Zheng.

267
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,330
At least, my ex-wife is the happiest than ever before.

268
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,090
Our lives are respectively fine.

269
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,150
And that's the best outcome.

270
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
You are really out of the ordinary.

271
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,400
We should probably get to bed.

272
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,060
What? It's still so early.

273
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,950
Everyone must be really tired.

274
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,760
Let's go to bed.

275
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,380
All right.

276
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,670
Well then, I won't bother the two of you.

277
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,340
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

278
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,450
Are you tired?

279
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,890
Do you want to go to bed?

280
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,100
Did you grab your sleeping bag?

281
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,350
I'm going to sleep in the car today.

282
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,490
That way, you can sleep with Ling Ling.

283
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,050
Or...

284
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,050
do you want to

285
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,370
sleep together in the tent today?

286
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,460
Fu Ligong.

287
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,550
- Come out of there.
- What's wrong?

288
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,260
Come on out, quickly.

289
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,110
Do you remember what happened senior year of high school?

290
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,110
Are you talking about...

291
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,530
when I was so drunk that I fell asleep in that classroom?

292
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,380
That was the first time I slept outside of my home.

293
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,060
I thought... it was pretty great.

294
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,650
We were stuck outside in the middle of the night.

295
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,020
And there was an alcoholic by your side. You thought that was pretty great?

296
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,930
Although we couldn't see the stars at school,

297
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,690
there were wild dogs barking in the middle of the night.

298
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,480
But as long as you're by my side, I feel at ease.

299
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,320
Let's wake up tomorrow and watch the sunrise together.

300
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,440
Are you certain you won't just dawdle in bed?

301
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,200
I'll be like this.

302
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,430
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

303
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:34,550
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

304
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,620
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

305
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,190
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

306
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,660
♫ I love you... ♫

307
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,550
♫ I miss you... ♫

308
00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:00,050
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

309
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,860
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

310
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,870
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

311
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:15,100
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

312
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,260
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

313
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,480
I don't think...

314
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,950
that these memories can so easily be cast aside.

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,820
[The daily sweet life of CPs Zheng and Fu who are in the same field.]

316
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,430
Why am I here?

317
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,960
How are my injuries healed?

318
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,610
I didn't think that you'd still have today,

319
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,430
Doctor Tu.

320
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,340
I see, it really is you!

321
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,560
Doctor Tu, I don't have your last name!

322
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,330
Just go ahead and die.

323
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,500
See, that's the word that I was talking about.

324
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,060
All right.

325
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,150
Do you want to see the movie edition?

326
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,630
So, you want to go to the movie theater and watch this?

327
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,470
That's right. You don't think it would be interesting?

328
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,270
Yes, that's right.

329
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,510
But didn't you say that you don't like to watch cliffhanger endings?

330
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,080
I like to watch them. I think they're fun.

331
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,090
We should go to the movie theater to support the movie version.
