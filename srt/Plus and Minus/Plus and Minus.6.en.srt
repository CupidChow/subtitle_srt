[Plus and Minus]

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,020
Before marriage, everyone puts in a lot of work together.

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,460
Who knew that, after marriage, you communicate less and less.

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,610
Furthermore, he's become increasingly dominant.

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,280
I try my best to talk with him, but he's impatient.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,600
I don't know, maybe our ways of thinking are too different.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,720
When we first got together, I respected him, of course.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,950
I'm trying to communicate with him. I do listen to him.

29
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,430
Actually, before we were together, of course I wanted to be with him forever.

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,310
Otherwise, why would I care about all this. Right?

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,110
It's just that I'm really too tired now.

32
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,380
I truly never thought that we would ever get divorced.

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,490
I had no idea that they were actually a couple.

34
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,920
They walked to the door one after the other but didn't meet each other's eyes.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,030
I'm sure there was some type of tacit understanding between them.

36
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,590
How do we take care of this?

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,220
The same as before, you'll accept the case and I'll reject it.

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,330
But if you unilaterally refuse, they'll find out in the end.

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,770
You're going to let them separate. Right?

40
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,770
Didn't they come to us because they wanted a divorce?

41
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,470
But they said they still love each other.

42
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,120
Sometimes, people will say they love one another,

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,550
simply for the sake of ensuring that they don't look like a bad person.

44
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,730
Since they want to divorce, that demonstrates they must have their reasons.

45
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,180
We just need to know whether their reasons are rational or not. That's enough.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,650
They're considering this so much because they're thinking about each other.

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,530
But love and marriage are two different things.

48
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,230
It's not just breaking up without feelings.

49
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,180
That's called self-righteousness.

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,560
If their relationship is unequal and their love is nonreciprocal,

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,640
how can they continue to get along and stay together?

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,930
I still have reservations about whether they love each other or not.

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,090
Well, in fact, there is no absolute right or wrong in either of our arguments.

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,920
Heads, I listen to you. Tails, you listen to me.

55
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,760
Looks like I'll be listening to you this time.

56
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,450
I have some good news!

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,150
Qi Tian has already been taken into custody in court.

58
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,270
- Really?
- Seriously?

59
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,660
Mrs. Ke should be able to adjudicate the divorce quickly.

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,380
That's great!

61
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,730
We should celebrate tonight!

62
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,750
That's really great.

63
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,740
Hi, Ling Ling.

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,850
Were you well-behaved today?

65
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,410
I always am, but our teacher gave us a lot of homework.

66
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,870
But I obviously did it all.

67
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,220
That's my girl, you're so smart.

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,900
But I have a few stinky lousy boys in my class. They're always making trouble.

69
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,890
They're very childish.

70
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,280
Well...

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,580
If you do well on your tests next time,

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,110
I'll take you to get some dessert. How does that sound?

73
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,390
That's what has to happen.

74
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,400
Didn't you say that you'd take me out to have some fun?

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,990
Well... I'll ask your mother to take you out for some fun. Okay?

76
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,770
But I want to go out and have some fun with you.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,310
It's older brother!

78
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,290
Hi, Ling Ling.

79
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,750
Brother, are you working at my dad's laundromat?

80
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,470
I'm working for him now.

81
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,250
Brother, let me tell you.

82
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,090
Dad always gets me desserts to make me happy,

83
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,230
but I really want to go out with him and have some fun.

84
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,890
Well, Ling Ling, where do you want to go?

85
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,040
I want to go camping and see the stars.

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,620
All right, Ling Ling.

87
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,450
Let's pinky swear on it.

88
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,070
If you score 100 on your next test, then we'll go camping.

89
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,030
Yay! Well, I'll go off and study then. Bye-bye!

90
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,920
Bye-bye!

91
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,770
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,020
Children are like that.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,370
I just booked it.

94
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,180
We'll go camping next week.

95
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,990
But we haven't found out Ling Ling's grade yet.

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,300
If she scores well, then we will go and celebrate, of course.

97
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,390
And if she doesn't score well, then she'll need even more encouragement.

98
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,770
She wants to go and have fun with you, after all. And she's worked hard for a while.

99
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,030
Thank... you.

100
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,860
I like you.

101
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,710
And I like your family.

102
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,590
I-I-If you're like this all the time,

103
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,910
you'll spoil her.

104
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,340
Well, I'll even spoil you, too.

105
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,200
Do you want me to help you?

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,350
Here?

107
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,970
To the left a little bit.

108
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,660
Here?

109
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,080
A little bit lower.

110
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,860
Here?

111
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,770
To the right a little.

112
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,820
Hey, don't ask for a mile when I've given you an inch. Don't order me around like a servant.

113
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,290
Thank you for taking care me of during this time.

114
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,200
I just wanted to thank you for taking that hit for me.

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,650
Otherwise, I would've had to go to the hospital.

116
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,610
Come here, so I can scratch that itch better.

117
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm going to go and take a shower.

118
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,860
Okay.

119
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,970
Zheng Zeshou, your clothes!

120
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,640
Zheng Zeshou, your clothes!

121
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,410
The shop owner who sold me the key ring said

122
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,300
that it was a pair of magical key rings.

123
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,970
As long as two people can hold onto the pair of key rings, then they would be together forever.

124
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,250
And actually, I was thinking of buying the other one the next day,

125
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,780
but the shop owner told me that a strange person had bought it.

126
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,240
Do you believe in fate?

127
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,350
This is really accurate!

128
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,560
And we're truly brothers.

129
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,460
You see, lots of things come back around to where they all started.

130
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,350
You could've given this to me earlier.

131
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,370
What did you give me a book for? I didn't read it.

132
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,410
You see, they fit together now.

133
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,820
Brothers really do think alike!

134
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,780
We really understand each other so well.

135
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,280
Okay, we have to go to work tomorrow. Right?

136
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,400
I should get going then.

137
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,910
I'll accept this eighteen-year-old gift.

138
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,020
Thank you.

139
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,890
I'm going to head out. Bye!

140
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,060
Do you like that one?

141
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,810
No, I was just looking, that's all.

142
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,130
Shopkeeper, I want this one.

143
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,440
Brother, if you buy a pair of those, then you'll stay with the person you love forever.

144
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,250
You want to give it to your girlfriend, right?

145
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,880
I don't want to be with a partner.

146
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,140
I just want to buy this one, thank you!

147
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,740
Hey!

148
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,410
Why are you walking so fast for?

149
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,890
You were just looking at that stuff for so long.

150
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,170
What did you buy?

151
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,450
Nothing.

152
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,950
- Let's eat some noodles.
- Don't you ever tire of eating that?

153
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,450
They're tasty. Let's go.

154
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,830
- I can take care of it myself.
- Stop being fussy.

155
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,850
Come here, so I can scratch that itch better.

156
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,190
Thank you...

157
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,600
for always staying by my side.

158
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,890
Good morning.

159
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,940
Is it okay if you don't go back?

160
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,120
Go back to where?

161
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,020
To your... home?

162
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,390
Am I not already home?

163
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,650
I mean your own home.

164
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm lost.

165
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,030
What does that mean?

166
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,070
I can't find my way back home.

167
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,020
Wait a minute.

168
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,270
My home is here.

169
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,360
Well, you don't need to set such an early alarm. Right?

170
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,300
Don't you work at night?

171
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,640
It's because I don't want to miss every morning with you.

172
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,380
There's no rush. I'll wait until you're ready to tell me.

173
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,120
I might...

174
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,060
still need a bit more time.

175
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,940
Well, I'm going to get to work, then.

176
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,770
Do you need any help?

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,340
Why don't you sleep for a bit more?

178
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,890
It looks like you have a lot of orders today.

179
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,360
Yes, and I need to finish this order up before tonight,

180
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,920
and I don't know if I'll have enough time to pick up Ling Ling.

181
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,870
I can pick up Ling Ling for you.

182
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,180
Really?

183
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,770
Yes.

184
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,090
Little Gong.

185
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,170
- Uncle Wang.
- Hi.

186
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,830
- About this case—
- I can take care of that case.

187
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,350
All right.

188
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,730
- Is your hand okay?
- Yes, it's doing well.

189
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,620
Little Gong.

190
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,100
His hand is not in a sling anymore, so he should be recovering well.

191
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,200
I went back to have my hand examined. The doctor said it was okay to just wear this brace.

192
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,750
That's great.

193
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,640
A'Shou, thank you

194
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,360
for taking care of Little Gong during this time.

195
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,400
It's something I should do, he's my brother.

196
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,770
All right, I'll leave you two to get back to work.

197
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,810
Goodbye, Uncle Wang.

198
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,170
Why isn't your dad here yet?

199
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,410
What's taking your dad so long?

200
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,600
It must have gotten too busy at work and he's forgotten to pick me up again.

201
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,720
- Big Brother!
- Your dad asked me to pick you up.

202
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,950
Let's go. I'll take you around to have some fun.

203
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,760
Ling Ling, do you want to eat the chocolate one?

204
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,550
No, it's too much. I'll wait because we're going to eat dinner later.

205
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,300
Dessert is for your other stomach.

206
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,170
You can't be like that, you'll be as unhealthy as my dad.

207
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,620
Mr. Kato,

208
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,930
do you owe my dad money?

209
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,400
Why would you think that, Ling Ling?

210
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
Because my dad's personality is very different from yours.

211
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,780
It doesn't seem like you two would be friends.

212
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,350
- You don't think so?
- No, I think it seems more like

213
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,810
you could owe him money.

214
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,660
Therefore, you have to work in his shop to pay him back.

215
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,470
Do you really think that our personalities are very different?

216
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,820
Yes, my dad is very shy.

217
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,320
He doesn't have any friends.

218
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,450
And he also doesn't take the initiative to make friends.

219
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,040
He spends his whole day in the laundromat.

220
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,740
And he doesn't eat well either.

221
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,720
He uses his work as an excuse every time.

222
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,930
Do you dislike your dad, Ling Ling?

223
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,440
No, I really like my dad.

224
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,660
Big Brother, I'm not speaking poorly about my dad.

225
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,250
I know.

226
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm very afraid that you will hate my dad.

227
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,440
I like your dad.

228
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,180
Really? Can we pinky swear on it?

229
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,780
I'll teach you a way of doing this. First you pinky swear,

230
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,260
then you raise up your hands

231
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,320
and interlace your fingers.

232
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,130
I've got some chocolate over here, do you want some?

233
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,730
No.

234
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,200
Hey, do you want to get a drink?

235
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,090
Or do you want to go to the batting cages and work out for a bit?

236
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,550
Or we could go watch a series?

237
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm going to go to the clinic.

238
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,860
Didn't you just go to the clinic?

239
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,580
I want my injury to heal quickly, I don't want it to affect work.

240
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,340
I'll go with you.

241
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,010
I can go by myself, I don't need you to come.

242
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,270
Why are you talking like that?

243
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,850
What I mean is... I can take care of myself.

244
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,520
Well, why do you like me, then?

245
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,870
- Amy.
- Hi, manager.

246
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,840
Why are you here today? Where's Yuki?

247
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,500
Yuki asked for today off.

248
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,930
He's not feeling well today. I'm filling in for him.

249
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,010
He's not feeling well?

250
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,530
He looked fine yesterday.

251
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,620
I don't know, that's just what he told me.

252
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,620
If he's not feeling well, he should ask me for time off himself.

253
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,700
How could he just find someone to fill in for him?

254
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,650
Manager, rest assured. I'll do a good job.

255
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,390
Hey, Sis.

256
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,900
I just specially blended this drink.

257
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,350
- Take a sip.
- You made it?

258
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,440
I call this drink...

259
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,420
"A rookie's flower."

260
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,540
What did you put in it?

261
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,280
Just some healthy green vegetables.

262
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,560
It has some spinach, celery,

263
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,260
and then some vodka as the base.

264
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,590
- It has such a weird flavor.
- Cilantro.

265
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,030
I added some cilantro.

266
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,110
Isn't it pretty creative?

267
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,810
Have you tried some of it yourself?

268
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,290
It really... has a weird flavor.

269
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,450
From now on, forget completely about that drink.

270
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,460
Learn the basics first.

271
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,830
Yuki is not a normal person, don't learn from him.

272
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,650
Understood.

273
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,240
Hurry and tidy up; stop messing around with making drinks.

274
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,410
All right.

275
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,980
Amy said you weren't feeling well.

276
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,940
What's going on?

277
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,030
Sis, you don't look well.

278
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,510
You don't want to know what happened.

279
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,150
Big Sister, hello.

280
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,490
My name is Jian Renling.

281
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,270
I'm the laundromat owner's daughter.

282
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,060
Everyone calls me Ling Ling.

283
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,850
Are you the "Big Sister Manager" that Big Brother was talking about?

284
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,730
This is for you.

285
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,430
Did you say that you go by Ling Ling?

286
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,370
Thank you for the cake.

287
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm going to talk with Big Brother for a bit.

288
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,550
So you gave my cake to her?

289
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,240
What kind of relationship do you have going on with the laundromat owner?

290
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,740
How did you become his nanny?

291
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,460
Oh... Thank you for picking up Ling Ling for me.

292
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,740
Thank you. Let's go.

293
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,520
Big Brother, eat dinner with us in a little while.

294
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm going to go and have dinner.

295
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,570
Bye!

296
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,750
Both, during and after work, what are you always lost in thought about?

297
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,160
Manager, take a look. Lawyer Zheng looks like he's in a really bad mood.

298
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,590
And are you in a good mood?

299
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,370
I'm... doing okay.

300
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,480
Well, head to the back and grab some beer, then.

301
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,970
Are you here by yourself today, Lawyer Zheng?

302
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,700
I wanted to treat someone to a drink.

303
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,120
Why are you by yourself? Where's Lawyer Fu?

304
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,200
Is there a difference between whether I'm here by myself or with someone?

305
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,730
Have you had a friend confess their feelings to you before?

306
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,980
You should have a lot of experience with that kind of thing.

307
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,820
It's different this time.

308
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,950
Do you believe in fate?

309
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,830
What's so different?

310
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,190
I don't know.

311
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,880
My heart feels warm.

312
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,310
You need to be careful.

313
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,420
Fu Ligong!

314
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,540
It's what I should have done.

315
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,500
I trust that if the roles were reversed, he would have done the same.

316
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,540
It seemed like, in that moment,

317
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,660
I had something but I also lost something.

318
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,510
If you're afraid of losing something, then don't speak rashly.

319
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,740
If you speak rashly,

320
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,550
then you will definitely make a big decision.

321
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,650
Feelings are like that.

322
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,770
When you obtain something,

323
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,940
you'll also lose something.

324
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,580
But you shouldn't ask me about this,

325
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,480
I've never confessed my feelings to someone before.

326
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,660
And I also don't know how it feels to confess one's feelings.

327
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,440
Right! Our beautiful manager is so attractive,

328
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,490
of course many people desire you.

329
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,660
Is it Fu Ligong?

330
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,270
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

331
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,440
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

332
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,620
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

333
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,230
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

334
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,650
♫ I love you... ♫

335
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,520
♫ I miss you... ♫

336
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,050
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

337
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,710
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

338
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,790
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

339
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:11,160
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

340
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,120
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

341
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,670
Fu Ligong! Fu Ligong, respond to me!

342
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,670
Don't you want to know my answer?

343
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,000
No, I don't want to know your answer!
