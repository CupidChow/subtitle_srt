♫ Even if the world returns to 0 on this day ♫

164
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,060
♫ A one plus minus one adventure ♫

165
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,580
♫ A declaration that adds up to love ♫

166
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,000
♫ As day and night circles, you are the best solution ♫

167
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:57,010
♫ No more bypassing the stars and the moon,
back to the house where we met ♫

168
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:03,410
♫ Even if the world gives up and reverses tomorrow ♫

169
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,770
♫ Just a little bit ♫

170
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,200
Thank you...

171
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,660
For entering my life.

172
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,440
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

173
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,870
Why didn't I scare you?

174
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,280
I was just in my bedroom and I heard you.

175
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,360
Oh, forget it. Come over here.

176
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,140
Why did you prepare so much?

177
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,780
You've helped and prepared our breakfasts for many years,

178
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,470
and the food is different every day.

179
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,670
Therefore, I also have no idea what on Earth you like to eat.

180
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,610
I figured if I bought one of everything, I would probably get something you liked.

181
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,090
What do you think?

182
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,920
Did I hit the mark?

183
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,890
Do you like this one?

184
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,780
Or... this one?

185
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,230
I know that you like to eat steamed buns with egg.

186
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,470
I've known you for so long, but when we seriously stop and observe each other,

187
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,970
we discover that there are many details that we were previously unaware of.

188
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,940
Quick, eat.

189
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,000
So this is...

190
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,660
This is our first official day of dating.

191
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,570
Have some breakfast; otherwise, I won't be able to bear it.

192
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,730
Does Lawyer Zheng want to meet with me today because he's decided to take my case?

193
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,410
Please wait a moment.

194
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,430
This way, please.

195
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,320
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

196
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,590
- Oh, did you follow me?
- Did I follow you?

197
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,850
You have a history of following me.

198
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,710
- Lawyer Zheng, it was him.
- Lawyer Fu, it was him.

199
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,200
Actually, we specifically asked the both of you to come.

200
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,240
Here's what's going on. Basically, because you both came to our office at the same time

201
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,560
and both requested that we take care of your case and handle your divorce,

202
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,410
so on the basis of fairness, we do not want to cover up the truth from you.

203
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,410
- Therefore, we asked you both to come.
- There's no need for all this trouble.

204
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,520
I'd like to ask you two right now to become my divorce lawyers.

205
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,200
I'll pay for everything in full this time.

206
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,420
- I don't care how much he pays, I'll pay twice that.
- Oh my goodness.

207
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,830
You can throw around money during a divorce,

208
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,890
But when I wanted to buy a camper, you nagged me about the cost.

209
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,570
You're still going to bring up the camper?

210
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,910
Did you even try to consult with me about that amount of money?

211
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm the one who makes the money. It's my business how I spend it.

212
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,240
Is there any way you could stop being so childish?

213
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,140
- Well, the car works perfectly fine.
- Wait a minute.

214
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,330
Stop!

215
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,860
Let's calm down, you two.

216
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,800
Our firm will never reject clients because of money.

217
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,720
How much do they hate each other?

218
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,150
Well, I'll continue to explain then.

219
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,890
The main reason I had both of you come today, is so we can evaluate your character.

220
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,650
We'll then proceed with the case.

221
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,180
And if one of you is unwilling to cooperate,

222
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,260
we will immediately cease the evaluation.

223
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,100
And we will directly take the case for the other.

224
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,970
Since we've reached a consensus, we'll get started.

225
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,320
Can you please go next door with Lawyer Zheng? Thank you.

226
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,980
This way, please.

227
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,750
Now, for the next part of this process, we'll be using a video recording

228
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,900
For further investigation and verification.

229
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,350
All right.

230
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,130
Please describe your strengths

231
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,040
and weaknesses in the third person.

232
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,950
I am a...

233
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,600
He is a boss.

234
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,520
He is good at marketing and shaping the images of corporations.

235
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,840
His weaknesses are...

236
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,890
Possibly...

237
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,660
his personality is a little aggressive and extreme.

238
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,220
He wants to do and complete everything in the fastest way possible.

239
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,180
Therefore...

240
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,690
he oftentimes appears to be...

241
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,930
too selfish. He doesn't listen to the viewpoints of others.

242
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,050
Please use the third person to describe your marriage.

243
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,450
On the surface, their marriage is very harmonious, but they are actually constantly arguing.

244
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,840
It probably has something to do with working at the same company.

245
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,400
There is cooperation and competition.

246
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,270
They are very confident in their own ways of thinking and rarely compromise. It's like...

247
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,920
It's like...

248
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,550
neither of them wants to lose.

249
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,110
I still remember often seeing the two of them together before.

250
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,350
And how they looked when they ate together.

251
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,530
After they got married,

252
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,900
their jobs became increasingly busy.

253
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,080
And the dining table was only being used to pile up odds and ends.

254
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,520
And after...

255
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,600
I rarely saw them eat together.

256
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,540
Please use your own perspective to describe the first time you saw him.

257
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,860
He had a warm smile.

258
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,230
A cheerful personality.

259
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,470
And cute dimples.

260
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,660
If you get a divorce, will you still remain in contact with him?

261
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,020
What you mean to ask is...

262
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,530
will we never see each other again?

263
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,290
I'll rephrase my words.

264
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,050
If you get a divorce, will you two remain friends?

265
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,410
I hope...

266
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,930
that after we're divorced...

267
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,900
we can wait a few days for the air to clear,

268
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,830
and that we can remain best friends.

269
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,580
Even if we can't be together, we can still move forward in life together.

270
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,910
We can still eat together and discuss our lives with each other.

271
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,470
So we can wait until the day when we're no longer angry with each other...

272
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,780
And we can then...

273
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,900
have a good...

274
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,980
conversation together again.

275
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,440
And then I can say thank you. I can say thank you for all your previous hard work.

276
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,910
I can thank him for being so accepting and tolerant of me.

277
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,050
I can say thank you.

278
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,130
I can say thank you...

279
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,020
for being so...

280
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,140
Thank you for...

281
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,710
for loving me so much.

282
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,110
What are you—

283
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,780
♫ Who cares who I'm still chasing ♫

284
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,110
Originally, you were the one who rushed over to hug me

285
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,140
and told me that we would support the company.

286
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,490
And support our family.

287
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,380
Wasn't that our agreement?

288
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,190
♫ Should I face it or runaway ♫

289
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,320
♫ Who cares who figured it out ♫

290
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,920
♫ Tell yourself not to think too much ♫

291
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,720
♫ Ask your heart for another chance ♫

292
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,470
♫ Keep it in a low voice ♫

293
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,580
So, are we reconciling then?

294
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,960
♫ I'm still behind you ♫

295
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,260
♫ And I don't want anything else ♫

296
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,130
♫ Can you give me another reason to cheer you on? ♫

297
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,110
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,000
What is the cost of your services today?

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,680
If there won't be a case, we'll just charge a consultation fee.

300
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,110
Thank you.

301
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,050
I'll remit a portion of that amount to you two.

302
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,390
- No problem.
- Thank you.

303
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,490
Let's go.

304
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,930
How was it even possible that we were talking about divorce?

305
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,360
Well, that case just fizzled out.

306
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,760
I think that working this job for so many years,

307
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,010
working as a divorce lawyer,

308
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,950
has let us often see the worst sides of some good people.

309
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,420
When you love someone very deeply, you can also hate them just as much.

310
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,200
If two people are willing to give each other a chance, to get to know each other,

311
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,360
then I believe there is no need to go down the road of divorce.

312
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,700
If we were to get divorced one day,

313
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,190
would you still want to be friends?

314
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,490
No.

315
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,920
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

316
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,080
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

317
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,180
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

318
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,800
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

319
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,300
♫ I love you... ♫

320
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,080
♫ I miss you... ♫

321
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,430
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

322
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,370
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

323
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:42,300
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

324
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,650
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

325
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:52,590
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

326
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,790
♫ I wish you could feel how I feel ♫

327
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,410
Maybe...

328
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,260
we still don't understand enough about this world.

329
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,590
Do you want to find out then?
