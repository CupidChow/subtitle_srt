Your mother will come and pick you up after school.

You'll go over to your mother's then, and you need to remember to be good. Okay?

Why did you go crazy when you were messing around with my hand this morning?

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,090
Was it because you were in a bad mood after I secretly opened your red wine?

82
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,600
Or is it because I used your account to watch that series?

I also pay an annual fee.

84
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,190
It must be about money for drinking. Wouldn't that be a lot of money, though?

You're a little stingy.

Why are you going back on your word? Did I not offer you enough money?

159
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,640
We can discuss the rate again. We can discuss it again!

160
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,480
I have some other cases that I need to tend to, at the moment.

161
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,690
I truly am unable to accept your case.

162
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,410
I apologize.

163
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,750
Was your client Ms. Ke's husband?

164
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,200
I hadn't signed the letter of appointment yet, so he is not technically my client.

165
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,710
Hey, Zhong Hou, shred this.

166
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,690
This is Lawyer Fu's enemy. Hurry up!

167
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,240
I completely wash my hands of it.

168
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,990
Attorney Zheng, you are really insisting on not fighting with Attorney Fu.

169
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,620
He's too great. If I were to fight with him, I would be beat to death.

170
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,080
You've never been afraid of troublesome cases before.

171
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,260
The trouble isn't found within the case itself, but the person.

172
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,780
Are you going to civil court?

173
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm going to investigate witness procedures. It'll be a piece of cake.

174
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,580
Mr. Jian.

175
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,450
You're here. Did you get off work late today?

176
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,370
Yes, I got busy with something.

177
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,380
This is for Ling Ling.

178
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,560
I remembered that she likes to eat sweets.

179
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,020
Lawyer Fu, thank you.
[Lai Lai Laundromat]

180
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,220
You're my customer, and yet you came here with a present.

181
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,800
There's no need to be so polite. I am usually bothering you with something.

182
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,540
I'll go to the back and grab your clothes.

183
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,150
Here.

184
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,270
I'm sorry, it's been two months.

185
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,080
No problem, I know you all are very busy.

186
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,420
As long as you eventually remember to pick them up, it's fine.

187
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,390
Just don't be like the owner of this pile of clothes.

188
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,680
I finished washing these clothes and the owner has never showed up.

189
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,670
So you've just left them like this, until the owner picks them up then?

190
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,860
I trust that one day they'll return and pick them up.

191
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,460
And there are many orders that have not been paid for yet.

192
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,760
Why are there two bags?

193
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,300
Lawyer Zheng passed by just now, and I originally called out to him and asked him to take his clothes,

194
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,330
but he said that I could just hand over his clothes to you.

195
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,040
Then he went downstairs.

196
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,060
So he went to Lang Yuan to get a drink?

197
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,870
I think so.

198
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,070
Do you often go downstairs to that bar to get a drink?

199
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,010
He goes more often than I do, and he usually drags me there.

200
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,080
Lawyer Fu, if you're really close with them,

201
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,770
could I bother you to ask them to quiet it down a bit?

202
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,770
- Sure, that's no problem.
- Thank you.

203
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,680
I thought you would just pick up our clothes and take them home.

204
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,150
- You should pick up your own clothes.
- You're so petty.

205
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,630
Nikita.

206
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,450
- Thank you.
- I haven't ordered for him yet.

207
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,150
Doesn't he have a gin and tonic every time?

208
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,040
Could I bother you to play a more quiet jazz music?

209
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,330
Do you not like the music playing right now?

210
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,930
Just change the music.

211
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,780
What's up?

212
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,740
When did you start listening to jazz?

213
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,120
Is it all to grab the attention of the beautiful bar manager?

214
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,770
You're starting up your bad habits again.

215
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,120
What bad habits?

216
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,240
Using sweet words to swindle women.

217
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,830
You have to make substantiated claims. How have I swindled anyone?

218
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,760
There's nothing but honest words coming out of my mouth.

219
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,590
For example, Nikita is a very beautiful woman. See?

220
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,410
- Are you defending yourself now?
- Defending myself?

221
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,010
- Am I that kind of person?
- Yes.

222
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,010
Nikita, can you give me two shots to take over to the table in the back?

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,930
I'm sorry, I ordered this drink for you without asking.

224
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,780
You can refuse, if you want

225
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,180
but you might hear one more sound out in the world after that.

226
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,100
What kind of sound?

227
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,810
The sound of a heart breaking.

228
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,730
How are you such good friends with someone like him?

229
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,200
I probably owe him something from a past life.

230
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,620
- Have you known each other for a long time?
- Yes, for over twenty years.

231
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,510
Over twenty years?

232
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,460
You two have come here so many times and that's the first I've heard about that.

233
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,500
It's not really something that is worth bringing up often anyway.

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,410
- Amy!
- Yes?

235
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,990
- Put another case of beer in the freezer.
- Okay.

236
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,230
Are you heading out?

237
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,300
He can deal with that on his own.

238
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,610
You're leaving so early today.

239
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,880
Do you want to make a bet?

240
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,130
In one minute, he's going to come back to you in utter despair.

241
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,660
Cheers to a beautiful night!

242
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,420
And even prettier company!

243
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,230
Five, four...

244
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,090
Three, two...

245
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,760
Hello, everyone!

246
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,590
Dang!

247
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,120
Why is he wearing sunglasses when it's so dark out?

248
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,230
Are you willing to gamble?

249
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,200
Cheers to a beautiful night and even prettier company!

250
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,490
[Stinky Boy, remember to go on a blind date with Aunt Wang's daughter tomorrow. Try again!]

251
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,730
What's wrong? Is your heart broken?

252
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,460
It's about time for our semi-annual routine.

253
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,950
You're trying to go on a blind date?

254
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,480
[From Dad. Ligong, I've arranged for you two to meet some people tomorrow at noon.]

255
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,990
Hello, Lawyer Fu.

256
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,510
Do you often deal with scary cases?

257
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,030
Have you ever dealt with a murder case before?

258
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,000
My main responsibility is dealing with civil cases.

259
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,970
So what do you do with your free time then?

260
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,890
Do you like sweets? I make desserts.

261
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,020
For example, I like lemon pie,

262
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,340
chocolate pie, and blueberry pie. What about you?

263
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,830
I'm sorry, I just remembered that I still have something to take care of at work.

264
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,650
I've got to get going.

265
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,670
- You want to leave?
- Yes.

266
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,520
It was really nice to meet you.

267
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,920
It was nice to meet you, too.

268
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,490
Do you like to travel? I really like traveling to Europe.

269
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

270
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm sorry. We have something we need to deal with at work and we must get going.

271
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,360
Oh, that was really fast.

272
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,240
But I still want to get to know Mr. Gong better.

273
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm sorry, it was really nice to meet you.

274
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,140
Can I add you on Line?

275
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,790
He left his phone in the car.

276
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,340
You can download a dating app, you'll have many options there.

277
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,310
Goodbye!

278
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,320
I never thought you would have to experience this, too.

279
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,660
I never thought that Uncle Wang would also try to set you up.

280
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,510
I'm sure 80% of them have been influenced by my dad.

281
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,000
We have to continue to meet even more of them this afternoon.

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm more tired than when I go to court.

283
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,140
It seems that Lawyer Fu is also a hard nut to crack.

284
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,880
What do you think? Do you want to try out my plan?

285
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,490
What plan?

286
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,230
We need to see if you can fit into the script.

287
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,670
I'm calling from the front lines of the battlefield. Xue Qing, are you there?

288
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,050
I'm here! Brother Ligong, this is the game plan for the blind date operation.

289
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,790
What is this?

290
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,250
So you don't usually take these blind dates seriously?

291
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,070
This kind of attitude and arrangement towards marriage doesn't suit me.

292
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,530
I'd just get divorced very soon thereafter.

293
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,370
Why do I have so many pages, and you only have one?

294
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,660
Don't worry, Brother Ligong.

295
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,000
With a great actor,

296
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,600
one only needs to give him an outline.

297
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,370
He can create an unlimited amount of lines and content.

298
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,750
Hey, rookie. This is your first time in this role.

299
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,590
When you don't know how to act, I would recommend

300
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,620
that you read the script carefully

301
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,520
and don't question the screenwriter.

302
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,460
Follow the lines and instructions written above.

303
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,400
As long as you do that, you'll be great!

304
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,070
So you do this stuff all the time?

305
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,770
Call me "Director".

306
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,880
Wait! Am I not the director?

307
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,790
- Director.
- What?

308
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,830
Konstantin Stanislavski in his book "An Actor Prepares," mentions

309
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,690
that actors have to be like soldiers.

310
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,900
They must be resolute and disciplined.

311
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,070
Don't worry, leave it all to me.

312
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,790
Set the scene! And action!

313
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,390
Hello, my name is Fu Ligong.

314
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,090
I'm currently a lawyer at Flourishing Hope Law Firm.

315
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,730
I'm sorry, this is my first blind date.

316
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,400
I've never dated anyone before.

317
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
Don't look at me! I don't dare to look straight at a woman!

318
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,820
I'm the director, so I'll call "cut."

319
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,390
There's something I need to tell you as well.

320
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm a boring person. I don't leave my house to do anything except work.

321
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,840
My biggest interest is playing jigsaw puzzles at home.

322
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,940
Excuse me.

323
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,800
Are you willing to date me on the premise of getting married?

324
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,880
After we get married, I hope that you'll focus all your attention on looking after our family.

325
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,420
I want two daughters and two sons.

326
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,530
I want us to be a big family of six!

327
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:39,950
With all that, I'll love you for eternity!

328
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,090
I'm feeling a little unwell. I should get going.

329
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,800
Don't you like me? I know that I just won't find anyone to love.

330
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,760
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry! Give me another chance!

331
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,870
Hello, I'm Fu.

332
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,030
I'm a lawyer at the Flourishing Hope Law Firm.

333
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,540
I trust that you've already looked over my information.

334
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,900
I believe that a good relationship requires

335
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,260
a certain level of understanding for one another.

336
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,660
I don't know if you have an interest in getting to know the true me.

337
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,820
Are you interested in being with an immoral and despicable person?

338
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,570
Dang, you've written a lot. What all is this? Why am I a beast?

339
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,390
Who told you not to take a look before?

340
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,420
Hey, that was pretty good.

341
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,890
You scared that girl off in less than five minutes.

342
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,860
Brother Ligong, you're actually really good!

343
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,190
I really think this isn't great.

344
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,040
You're halfway through, and you're going to stop now?

345
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,730
We're just acting. Don't worry!

346
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,110
All right. If you really care, I'll act in the next scene.

347
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,140
You can just play along, okay?

348
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,960
Are you sure that it has to be like this?

349
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,380
Of course.

350
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,780
But I'm a professional actor.

351
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,220
Hello, my name is Zheng Zeshou.

352
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,530
I'm a lawyer at the Flourishing Hope Law Firm.

353
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,990
Hello, my name is Jian Xuan.

354
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm a teacher.

355
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,660
Jerk!

356
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,400
I'm sorry! I love you!

357
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:22,550
"Between Positive and Negative" - Sung by Ai Yufan, Lyrics by Wen Xiyang

358
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:34,520
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

359
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,630
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

360
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,810
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

361
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,390
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

362
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,540
♫ I love you... ♫

363
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,670
♫ I miss you... ♫

364
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,870
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

365
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,050
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

366
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,930
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

367
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,290
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

368
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,510
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

369
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,720
Are you shy?

370
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,200
Okay, you're drunk.

371
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,560
My, the great lawyer gets shy too.
