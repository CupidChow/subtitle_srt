[Plus and Minus]

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,570
Why are there so many people in front of Mr. Jian's shop?
[Episode 3]

23
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,640
You leave stuff like this and play deafeningly loud music all the time. How can you mess up other people's storefronts?

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,740
What store front?

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,410
This is a laundromat and I'm the owner! Why do you do this all the time?

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,250
- So what then?
- Should we call the police?

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,240
You villains probably reported me first, didn't you?

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,270
What on earth is wrong with you?

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,000
You're the one who's standing in front of our storefront and prohibiting us from walking downstairs.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,300
You're committing a crime and we can sue you. You know that, right?

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,220
- You...
- Exactly.
- You're not allowing us to do our business.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,980
Yuki, what are you doing?

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,410
It's not a big deal. If we just clean a little, it'll be fine.

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,870
Can you grab a dustpan for me?

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,930
- I can take care of this.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,440
Mr. Jian, are you okay?

37
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,390
I'm fine. I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,340
Hey, Yuki, is everything all right?

39
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,960
Some customers must have drunkenly knocked over the trash yesterday.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,610
Everything's fine now.

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,650
- You two are here early today.
- No, we were just passing by.

42
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,310
Come in and have a drink.

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,810
We can't, we have plans tonight.

44
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,670
[Next Season. Coming Soon...]

45
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,660
- What kind of unfinished ending was that?
- What do you mean?

46
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,420
In order to set the tone and foreshadow for the next season, they just ended it right there.

47
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,030
That was so crappy!

48
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,270
I agree. Maybe it would be better to get rid of our subscription.

49
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,560
No, I don't think so. You would be bored, then.

50
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,200
No, I don't think so.

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
Then, why haven't you gotten rid of your subscription?

52
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,310
Oh, I see. It's because of me.

53
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,150
No, it's not.

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,330
I know that you're so good to me.

55
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,900
This is getting empty.

56
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,870
Hey, did you understand that last part?

57
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,030
Why did that policeman write the character for "earth"?

58
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,570
It wasn't the character for "earth," it was a plus or minus sign.

59
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,810
I think it was the character for "earth."

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,140
Article 325, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law stipulates that a person who intends to rob another's movable property for

61
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,940
himself or a third party's illegal property shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not less than six months

62
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,340
- but not more than five years.
- What are you stuttering for?

63
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,420
I can't even take a look at it?

64
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,300
You're so petty.

65
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,610
What's going on?

66
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,740
All right, I apologize. Don't be angry.

67
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm thinking about Mrs. Ke's case.

68
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,230
Didn't you already help her apply for a protective order?

69
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,270
[Lawyer Fu, I'm being followed again.]

70
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,060
Mrs. Ke has a protective order, but you don't.

71
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,780
Why do I need one? If he dares to touch me, then he can try.

72
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,510
But who is he really? I—

73
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,080
You need to be careful.

74
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,280
Yes, I know.

75
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,010
Strange. Why was Fu Ligong so weird today?

76
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,200
Zheng Zeshou. He probably didn't see what is inside this box, right?

77
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,010
Come! Come! All of these things have been blessed by the God of Love.

78
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,630
As long as you can find a pair amongst these objects, you and your partner will stay together for a lifetime.

79
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,340
Thank you.

80
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,300
Do you like this one?

81
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,550
No, I'm just looking.

82
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,230
Ling Ling, don't just run around everywhere.

83
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,680
Hey!

84
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,200
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,980
I'm so sorry.

86
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,470
Oh, it's you.

87
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,730
I'm sorry, it seems that my clothes have eaten your ice cream.

88
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,660
Please, take some of this to eat.

89
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,080
Thank you, Big Brother.

90
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,770
Thank you.

91
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,200
I'm sorry about your clothes.

92
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,280
I can pay you back for the cake and your clothes.

93
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,350
You're the owner of the laundromat, right?

94
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,410
Could I bother you to help me with this?

95
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,400
Lawyer Zheng, do you want to go out to eat with us?

96
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,380
- No, thank you. You guys go on ahead.
- Okay, let's go then.

97
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,640
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

98
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,450
Here, eat some food.

99
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,130
You brought me food again.

100
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,930
I came to see if you were being lazy or not.

101
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,310
Of course, I haven't been lazy.

102
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,810
What are you so happy about?

103
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,430
Mr. Zheng! It's always extra work for you to bring lunchboxes. Thank you.

104
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,020
Not at all. It's no trouble, really.

105
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,860
Little Gong, regardless of how busy you are, you have to eat.

106
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,040
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

107
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,500
Anyway, Mr. Zheng, I've missed both of them.

108
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,700
Honestly, you don't need to worry too much.

109
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,240
Perhaps, our sons have found partners that they like.

110
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,280
We can't be sure.

111
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,530
You have nothing to worry about with your Little Gong.

112
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,520
- But look at him, take a look at him.
- All right. Could we not discuss these typical holiday topics?

113
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,390
Uncle Wang is just talking.

114
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,900
And if you must know, Fu Ligong really does have someone that he likes.

115
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,410
No, do you actually have someone that you really like?

116
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,150
No, I don't. That's nonsense.

117
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,670
You're really not sharing anything with us.

118
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,100
I said I don't have anyone that I like.

119
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,130
No wonder you've been so secretive and mysterious lately.

120
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,980
Little Gong, if you have a girlfriend,

121
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,570
you should bring her by my shop.

122
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,820
I'll prepare a whole table full of food for you two.

123
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,760
- What about me?
- Oh, you...

124
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,650
If you really have a partner, I'll prepare an entire feast.

125
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,940
I'll invite people from every street to come and eat.

126
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,460
Make sure to finish this, okay? I still have some things to take care of at the shop, so I should get going.

127
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,290
- I'll walk you out.
- Oh, there's no need.

128
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,040
- I really should.
- There's truly no need!

129
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,260
- Goodbye, Dad!
- Goodbye!

130
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,010
How are things with Mrs. Ke's case?

131
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,530
I haven't gotten any other information today.

132
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,130
Good. As long as you can push through the rest of this week, you'll be fine.

133
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,680
Have you gotten any more information on your end?

134
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,400
Let me tell you... My friend is extremely efficient.

135
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,480
Do you know what Qi Tian has been up to?

136
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,590
He's been intentionally hurting people, threatening to collect debts, and generally up to no good.

137
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,130
My main point is that all of those witnesses want to come forward and testify.

138
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,270
How has your progress been?

139
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,610
Mrs. Ke has now received a list of her injuries and examinations.

140
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,380
With that and your evidence, I should be able to expedite the divorce proceedings.

141
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,440
You're also incredibly efficient. That's pretty good.

142
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,430
You should be really careful. You know that, right?

143
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,560
What are you talking about? Let's eat.

144
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,730
I'm here.

145
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,300
Good morning.

146
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,830
Where's your name tag?

147
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,900
I... forgot to bring it today.

148
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,130
It couldn't be that you forgot it at someone's house, right?

149
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,780
Where's my stuff?

150
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,370
What do you mean?

151
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,980
Didn't I ask you to go and pick up a cake?

152
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,760
You forgot about that, too. I'll just go and get it myself now.

153
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,500
Well...

154
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,260
I got hungry, and so I ate the cake.

155
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,440
You got hungry and ate it?

156
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,360
I checked it out for you. It was very tasty.

157
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,770
You know that this shop is only making a limited amount of cakes at this time, right?

158
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,370
They only make three per day.

159
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,570
Last week, I placed my order immediately after the pre-orders opened. I waited until now to get mine.

160
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,830
And you're telling me that you ate it?

161
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,910
Don't be angry.

162
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,910
How about I help you order another one?

163
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,460
It isn't that simple. You can't just order another one.

164
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,280
Their ingredients are very limited, and they could run out of stock at any time.

165
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,260
I don't know the next time when I'll be able to order another. Throw it up!

166
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,100
It'll be okay.

167
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,320
Trust me. There has to be a way.

168
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,470
- Your makeup looks very nice today.
- Don't give me that crap.

169
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,150
Yuki! After you're done cleaning the toilet, bring over two cases of wine.

170
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,870
All right!

171
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,730
Are you sure you want to go then?

172
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,960
It's all been talked over. Xiaoyu and the others are waiting for us on the roof.

173
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,150
But what time is it now? Are you sure?

174
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,720
If they don't go ahead first and help us, then how will we get up there?

175
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay, just eat. Oh, and there's cake, too.

176
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,810
Oh.

177
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,070
Did you buy a birthday present?

178
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,920
- Who's asking now?
- I guess it wouldn't be good to reveal it now.

179
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,450
You're acting very mysteriously.

180
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,550
Let me tell you... I got a birthday present this time.

181
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,380
You are definitely going to like it.

182
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,580
Fu Ligong! Fu Ligong!

183
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,280
Fu Ligong! What are you lost in thought over? Help me grab this.

184
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,100
[Savory Dumplings / Ban Tiao Noodles / Rice Noodles]

185
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,980
Thanks.

186
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,400
Do you remember this noodle shop?

187
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,490
It's already been so long since we were students.

188
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,280
Unexpectedly, it hasn't changed a bit, but we've completely grown up.

189
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,600
Are you sure that you've grown up? Sometimes you act about three years old.

190
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,080
Eat your noodles.

191
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,440
- It still tastes the same.
- Right?

192
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,220
Back in high school, you were going crazy. We had no idea what was going on.

193
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,590
Every day after cram school, we would come here and have a bowl of noodles.

194
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,000
- And then Mr. Zheng would undoubtedly always cook us rice.
- That's right!

195
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,510
And if I didn't eat it, he would hit me.

196
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,330
So, at that time, every night I felt so full I thought I was going to burst.

197
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,120
- You've always been like that.
- Here!

198
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,790
Here are your side dishes.

199
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,940
Thank you, beautiful shopkeeper.

200
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,410
It's been more than ten years. What are you doing calling me "beautiful shopkeeper" still?

201
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,230
What side dishes do you want to eat? It'll be my treat.

202
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,290
Oh, no, thank you. We already have so much to eat over here. Thank you though.

203
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,740
All right, enjoy your meal.

204
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,390
Okay, we will. Thank you!

205
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,090
Even now, the shopkeeper is still so kind to you.

206
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,510
She's a great shopkeeper. I have an endless supply of noodles and side dishes here.

207
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,670
Are you jealous? This is so great.

208
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,550
Who's calling me?

209
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,100
- Hello?
- Classmate!

210
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,930
- Hey, what's up?
- We're a little heartbroken over here right now.

211
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,950
I wanted to ask if you'd come out and have a drink with us.

212
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,890
Are you free tomorrow night?

213
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,430
Yeah, I'm free.

214
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,170
Will Fu Ligong come with you, too?

215
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,950
Fu Ligong?

216
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,240
Yeah, he'll be able to make it.

217
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,300
Okay, sounds like a plan. Bye!

218
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,850
What was that all about?

219
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,310
Something big has happened.

220
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,090
Hi.

221
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,480
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,330
This is for you.

223
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,680
I'm sorry, I went to several stores to find something that would look closest to yours,

224
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,620
but there's no way it's exactly the same.

225
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,550
I'm really sorry.

226
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,980
Sis, isn't that the owner of the laundromat upstairs?

227
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,710
Oh, it's you again. We haven't even opened yet, what are you doing here?

228
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,360
I apologize.

229
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,760
I got a little out of control last time, things got out of hand.

230
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,380
I'm really sorry.

231
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,780
Okay.

232
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,030
I'll remind my customers to not leave trash in front of your laundromat.

233
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,440
Thank you for stopping by.

234
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,370
Sit down, I'll make you a drink.

235
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,240
No, thank you. Drinking isn't really a habit of mine.

236
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,220
Well, habits can change.

237
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,220
I hope I can make you a drink the next time you stop by.

238
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,270
Okay, I should get going now.

239
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,090
Goodbye!

240
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,030
Try it. Maybe it'll taste better than the other cake.

241
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,270
Get to work.

242
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,390
You're staring off into space. Get to work.

243
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,670
Mrs. Ke, we have a protective order now.

244
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,320
So, for the moment, you don't have to be too worried.

245
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,790
Additionally, we have a medical report and a list of your injuries as further evidence of domestic violence.

246
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,080
This is already in accordance with Article 1052 of the Civil Code.

247
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,500
This meets the definition of unbearable cohabitation between two spouses.

248
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,470
It should actually be extremely easy for us to file for divorce.

249
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,650
Really?

250
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,380
You're really so great. I feel very grateful to you.

251
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,000
However, there is one other matter.

252
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,930
If Mr. Qi has to appear in court for other cases,

253
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,810
we may need to ask you to help testify.

254
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,380
Lawyer Fu, I want to ask.

255
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,160
Do you know who my husband originally hired as his lawyer?

256
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,140
His original lawyer is a principled person.

257
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,450
I wanted to ask.

258
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you know why my husband is suddenly being investigated?

259
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,830
I think it's because men like him attract attention from others.

260
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,580
This isn't uncommon. But you really have nothing to be worried about.

261
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,370
He won't suspect you or take out his revenge on you.

262
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,190
All right, I understand. Thank you.

263
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,460
There's no need to walk me out.

264
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Rest assured, we'll take care of everything.

265
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,490
I see. You think that I'm a principled person.

266
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,660
How are things going with Mr. Qi's case?

267
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,800
Qi Tian has slowed down a bit since hearing the rumors.

268
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,540
He urgently wants to destroy all the evidence.

269
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,390
It's a pity that he leaves a trail of evidence everywhere he goes.

270
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,920
It looks like we'll be able to, easily, finish this case.

271
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,340
Of course. You have me to help you, right?

272
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,740
And then we can just drink and relax at tonight's get-together.

273
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,080
What get-together?

274
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,110
Yesterday, I agreed to get drinks with our old classmates to celebrate their return to being single.

275
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,230
Well, your agreeing to go out with them has nothing to do with me.

276
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,300
Hey, why are you being like that? I already told them you would go.

277
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,330
How on earth is this worth celebrating?

278
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,810
Of course, it should be celebrated.

279
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,420
Those out of relationships have already broken themselves away from the abyss of misery that is love.

280
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,140
Of course, that's cause for celebration.

281
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,200
So if you were to break up with someone, this is how you would celebrate it?

282
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,060
I... I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

283
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,550
I only have one question for you. Are you going or not?

284
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,620
I'm not going.

285
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,360
It's okay. Don't look so miserable. Let's drink.

286
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,150
I did not expect that Ligong would actually come.

287
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,750
I did not expect that our ever-aloof Prince Charming would actually show up today.

288
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,700
Wait a minute. Fu Ligong... Prince Charming?

289
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,280
Hey, A'Shou, don't get jealous.

290
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,970
Did you guys only call me so that I would bring Fu Ligong?

291
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,370
This is what I get for looking after you guys so much.

292
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,050
That really makes me so sad.

293
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,520
What are you smiling about, Mr. Prince Charming?

294
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,910
If you're Prince Charming, then what am I? Am I more like Matsuyama or Takeshi Kaneshiro?

295
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,720
Oh, Takeshi Kaneshiro

296
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,940
- is so handsome and great.
- Kaneshiro, will you ever notice me?

297
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,530
Do you know who this is?

298
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,510
It's so lively today.

299
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,710
Lawyer Zheng has brought his classmates today to celebrate their return to being single.

300
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,720
I didn't expect that Lawyer Fu would also come to join this get-together.

301
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,470
Do you know him well?

302
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,470
I just feel that you two are very similar types of people.

303
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,870
What does that mean? What type of person are you referring to?

304
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,460
What are you talking about?

305
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,310
Lawyer Zheng. Lawyer Fu. I have some shots for you guys.

306
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,480
Hey, Yuki, these are some of your fans.

307
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,360
Thank you.

308
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,110
Why is everyone close to A'Shou? So handsome.

309
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,160
I heard that today you are celebrating your return to being single.

310
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,130
Yes, that's right. I'm single now.

311
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,780
Here, you can sit next to me. Come on.

312
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,500
You look like the main person that's celebrating today.

313
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
- Well, I'll play a game with him then.
- Yes, come on now.

314
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
That sounds fun! What kind of game?

315
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,780
It's called "The King's Game." The person who draws a king can assign two people to do something.

316
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,230
If someone can't complete the task, then they have to take a shot.

317
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,650
- Does that make sense?
- Yes!

318
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,350
Whoever has a king, show your cards.

319
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,380
Oh, Fu Ligong has it.

320
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,130
Whoever has the Ace of Spades and the Three of Spades has to make a funny face.

321
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,930
Oh, you really don't know how to play.

322
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,930
You guys are playing like you're in middle school.

323
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,410
If middle schoolers knew that we were playing at this level in a bar, they would die from laughter.

324
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,990
Be a little more bold. Come on, let's do another round.

325
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,700
Whoever has a king, show your cards.

326
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,980
I have it. Everyone, pay attention.

327
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,100
The two people that I pick

328
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,710
are going to rub noses together.

329
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,460
Who are they? Show your cards.

330
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,150
The Two of Spades and the Four of Spades.

331
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,190
Who has those cards?

332
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,960
Fu Ligong has the Four of Spades.

333
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,270
- Let's see your performance.
- Hurry, hurry!

334
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,900
I'll...

335
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,700
Do you really want to drink?

336
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,900
Come on now, let's do a third round.

337
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,730
You've found your energy again!

338
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,970
You didn't want to join either of the other two rounds and now you want in? What's that about?

339
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,810
Let's not talk about it.

340
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,120
Come, come! You should have one drink first.

341
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,320
Come on, let's do a third round. Let's start!

342
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,180
I have the King this time.

343
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,760
Oh, that's too bad. I wanted to do something with you.

344
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,090
We haven't finished the game yet, you still have a chance.

345
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,490
I want to raise the stakes and excitement of this game.

346
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,800
I want whoever has the Two of Spades to kiss whoever has the Ace of Spades.

347
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,990
Classmate, I'm sorry. I can drink, you don't have to kiss me, really.

348
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,730
We'll have plenty of time to drink. Come on now.

349
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,010
- Again!
- Again!

350
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,810
No, I won't tease you again.

351
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,070
Okay, let's do another round!

352
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,690
Sorry, I'm feeling a little unwell. I'm going to go.

353
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,620
Hey, what's wrong?

354
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,170
Fu Ligong!

355
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:59,500
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

356
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,600
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

357
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,760
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

358
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,370
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

359
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:19,510
♫ I love you... ♫

360
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,650
♫ I miss you... ♫

361
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,880
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

362
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,940
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

363
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,890
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

364
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:45,210
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

365
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,210
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

366
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,540
You really know how to run, Lawyer Zheng!
