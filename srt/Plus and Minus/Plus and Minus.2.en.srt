[Plus and Minus]

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,580
Hello, my name is Zheng Zeshou.
[Episode 2]

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,940
I'm a lawyer at the Flourishing Hope Law Firm.

24
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,280
Hello, my name is Jian Xuan.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm a teacher.

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,240
Jerk!

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,640
Who are you?

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,740
What are you doing throwing water at people?

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,430
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,910
Forget the script and just improvise.

31
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,750
I'm sorry. Actually, I...

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,540
Who is she?

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,710
Dang, you're actually hitting me...

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,420
Please, let me explain.

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,830
Or you could explain this to me.

36
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,520
I was forced to go on this blind date!

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,900
- If you want to break up, then I can help you with that.
- It's not a good look for us to fight here.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm sorry this is happening today, Miss Jian.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,130
- There's no need to explain, you're a jerk.
- Fu Ligong!

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,110
I love you!

41
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,690
I shouldn't hide my feelings from you. I will always love you.

42
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,580
I don't want to let you go again!

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,140
Mr. Zheng!

44
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,300
You two can continue.

45
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,250
She already left, you can let go of me.

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,580
- There's nothing wrong with a little kiss.
- Let me go!

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,670
Dang! Why did you hit me for real?

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,390
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,340
It's fine, Brother Ligong. My brother has such thick skin. You could hit him a few more times, and he'd be fine.

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,820
If you're so brave, then don't run away from me.

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,420
What's wrong with you? I'll tell Dad.

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm not afraid of you.

53
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,400
Oh, that's right.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,010
When I saw you holding Brother Ligong's face just now,

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,040
it was really...

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,460
Xue Qing, let me tell you.

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,120
- If someone treats you like that, it's called sexual harassment.
- Really?

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,450
No, it's not. I just held your face. It was nothing more than that.

59
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,860
What are you thinking in that head of yours?

60
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,200
What's wrong with you? You've got a big empty hole in your head.

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
A big empty hole!

62
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,200
- Hello, Dad.
- Zheng Zeshou!

63
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,980
Damn it! What on earth do you think you're doing?

64
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,600
- Dad.
- Dad.

65
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,350
- I can sweep that for you.
- It's fine, it's fine. I can do it myself.

66
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,050
Why are you closing the shop so early today?

67
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,560
- I'm all out of supplies.
- I'll help you call and get some more.

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,990
There's no need for that. I'm not in a good mood.

69
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,840
You can't be a boss simply based on your mood.

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,980
So you understand now that you cannot only do things based on your mood?

71
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,220
You were basing your attitude towards marriage on your mood.

72
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,850
Dad, actually...

73
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,050
Dad, I thought it was really boring and I wanted to have a little fun.

74
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,070
You wanted to have a little fun?

75
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,100
Oh, come on!

76
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,010
I've never asked you to make a lot of money or be famous or anything else.

77
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,150
I just want to help you find a partner.

78
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,280
So that you can have a family and get married. Doesn't that sound nice?

79
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,120
- Mr. Zheng, I'm sorry. It was my fault.
- Little Gong, I know.

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,280
I know that you and A'Shou have a very good relationship, and you like to speak for him.

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,210
But you can't follow his lead and play along with him like this every time.

82
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,130
Who says that marriage will certainly bring happiness and fulfillment?

83
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,280
Who says that having a family won't just lead to its eventual collapse?

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,180
Oh, that's right. You're a big lawyer. You know how to talk, and I can't win in an argument with you.

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,300
You have to think for yourself.

86
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,590
How old are you now?

87
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,050
Now none of those matchmakers

88
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,220
will even dare to pick up my calls.

89
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,540
Even if we didn't find a match this time around, luckily, there's a relative on your mother's side who has a friend she can introduce to you.

90
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,160
What relative on my mom's side?

91
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,900
Dad, I don't have a mother.

92
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,890
Why are you saying you don't have a mother?

93
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,130
All right, Dad.

94
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,220
She went through a lot of pain to give birth to you after ten months.

95
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,930
So that kind of woman can go through the pain and give birth to me after ten months,

96
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,010
and then she can just abandon her family and children?

97
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,700
She's not just any woman, she's your mother.

98
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,770
Dad, how many times have I said this?

99
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,800
She is not my mother. I wouldn't even be able to recognize her.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,730
You shouldn't talk like this.

101
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,280
After she left, she has never once come back to take care of us. Why does she suddenly care now?

102
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,370
Is it because her partner and others have run away? Or is it because she doesn't have any money?

103
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,390
Or is it because she knows that she was wrong, and now she's returned in search of our forgiveness?

104
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,700
What are you saying?

105
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,230
You should speak about her with a little more respect.

106
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,540
Respect? Why should I respect that kind of person?

107
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,130
Are you going to talk back to me now?

108
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,730
Dad, this family consists of you, me, and Xue Qing.

109
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,090
There will never be a place for her in this family.

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,570
- Zheng Zeshou!
- Brother...

111
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,140
- Zheng Zeshou!
- Mr. Zheng, I'm sorry.

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,610
I don't want... a mother!

113
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,270
I!

114
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,870
Don't want!

115
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,460
What?

116
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,630
A mother?

117
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,860
Do you still remember the client I dealt with in May of last year?

118
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,260
It was just a little different from this.

119
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,370
And in the end?

120
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,960
We could only look on helplessly as that woman

121
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,370
completely drained our client of his savings and ran off to find another man.

122
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,910
If the law had not been amended, I definitely could have won that case.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,810
Even if that were true,

124
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,150
there was nothing else we could do.

125
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,880
Our field is civil law, but the law that was amended was a part of criminal law.

126
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,750
If all marriages needed to be restricted by criminal law, wouldn't that be pretty scary?

127
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,720
Then they'll just keep letting those kinds of people go around and wreak havoc out there.

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,690
But it also means that kind of person won't be able to find true love.

129
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,250
This is a punishment that she will have given herself.

130
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,850
But those who are left behind in the chaos they create will suffer greatly.

131
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,310
They also experienced love, why should they have to be punished?

132
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,940
If your partner no longer loves you, but you force them to stay with you,

133
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,030
if you force them to stay by your side, who is really being punished?

134
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,060
This is why divorce lawyers exist.

135
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,880
Our job is to help reduce the pain and suffering

136
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,330
of those who have already lost their love.

137
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,420
That way, they can have a fresh start in life.

138
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,350
And it's not our place to judge.

139
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,840
Please take a sip of this.

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,280
This drink is called "A perplexed young girl."

141
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,910
This is no longer a girl who is very perplexed.

142
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,690
Is it because of them?

143
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,430
Brother, are you okay?

144
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,800
Is there something wrong?

145
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,590
I'll tell you what you earned today.

146
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll cover everything that you're drinking today. But first, bring us a shot.

147
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,610
- Let's get one round for everyone here.
- Are you really happy today?

148
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,910
Yes, our plan to resist our blind dates was a great success.

149
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,800
We should certainly celebrate.

150
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,580
So you succeeded, then?

151
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,240
Well, if it isn't our beautiful bar manager. What?

152
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,290
Are you interested in our dating plans?

153
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,090
If so, then I have to share them with you.

154
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,980
You're not going to prank those girls again, are you?

155
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,970
Prank? I don't think so. I call it self-preservation.

156
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,410
Let me tell you. If I had a partner,

157
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,000
you all would be the ones who would lose out the most.

158
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,720
Here's your shot.

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,060
Thank you, Yuki.

160
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,200
Take one. Take a shot.

161
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,670
Brother Ligong, is my brother okay?

162
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,040
He's fine, I'm not worried.

163
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,150
Zheng Xueqing, college students shouldn't go to bars and drink too often.

164
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,820
But have a drink with your brother!

165
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,800
- Zheng Zeshou.
- What?

166
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,700
- You should slow down with your drinks.
- What are you talking about? I can't hear you.

167
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,390
Come on! Cheers, everyone!

168
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
Yuki, have a shot with us! Nikita!

169
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,780
Don't be like that. Have a drink with us!

170
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,690
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

171
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,100
Article 195, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code.

172
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,880
Unlawful injury to the body of others.

173
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,480
When one unlawfully infringes upon the health or reputation of others...

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,440
Forget it.

175
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,570
You're like this every time.

176
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,030
What do you mean "every time"?

177
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,530
You're like this every time you have to talk about your mother.

178
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,220
My mother is long gone.

179
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,620
Your dad is just concerned about you. That's why he's talking about this so much with you.

180
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,390
You shouldn't fight with him, okay?

181
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,840
I know.

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,160
Let's go. We have to work tomorrow.

183
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,160
You know you're the best, right?

184
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,990
Let's go.

185
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,640
You really can't?

186
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,240
I really, really like you very much.

187
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,280
- I like you too.
- So, we should be together then.

188
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,200
But I like her, her, and her too.

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,560
Oh, why are you so fickle?

190
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,220
I really like them, but you're the only one sitting in front of me right now.

191
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,990
Here, this red drink is called "Kokoro's Heart."

192
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,400
Thank you!

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,450
Did you resolve your issue yet again?

194
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,900
Resolve my issue?

195
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,240
I'm talking about the nonsense that you just said.

196
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,340
If you used that on another person,

197
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,520
for example, Zheng Zeshou,

198
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,210
it definitely would not work.

199
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,310
Well, how is it nonsense?

200
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,910
Sister, do you have anyone that you like?

201
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,850
Me?

202
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,200
In this world, I have many more people that I hate than I love.

203
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,200
For example,

204
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,410
the laundromat upstairs.

205
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,040
Do you? I think their laundromat is old,

206
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,740
but very cute and quaint.

207
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,130
Slow down.

208
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,870
Your alcohol tolerance is so bad, and yet you love to drink.

209
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,140
It's been so long and you still haven't changed this.

210
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,230
I've just used it for a long time, I'm used to it.

211
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,280
It's been so many years,

212
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,740
but you're still so fussy.

213
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,160
All right. I'll help you to your room so you can rest.

214
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
No!

215
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,760
I want to sleep on the couch.

216
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,090
Let's go. Stop messing around.

217
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,910
You're so shy.

218
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,300
- All right, you're drunk.
- What are you doing?

219
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,570
Is the great Lawyer Fu still shy?

220
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,890
Fu Ligong, thank you for always being by my side.

221
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,880
You really are the best.

222
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,530
Goodnight!

223
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,770
Wait!

224
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,170
It's still not safe.

225
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,650
- Don't run!
- Then don't chase me!

226
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,210
Hold on.

227
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,840
Happy birthday!

228
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,350
I will...

229
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,930
always be by your side.

230
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,870
You're drunk.

231
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,060
So what about my present then?

232
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,490
Hurry up! Hurry up!

233
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,420
Here.

234
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,000
What is this?

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,630
All we do in class is read,

236
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,720
and you're giving me another book to read?

237
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,060
No, I can't.

238
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm going to sleep for a bit.

239
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,990
I'm going to sleep.

240
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,500
[Lai Lai Laundromat]

241
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,010
Take a look. Look at how smelly and dirty this man is.

242
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Seriously.

243
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,320
I thought you would sleep until noon.

244
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,600
Damn! You really are a ghost, aren't you?

245
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,170
You can make some noise when you get up. Okay?

246
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,590
Here, have some breakfast.

247
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,430
Are you hungover?

248
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,590
Yes.

249
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,670
What are you doing?

250
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,990
I wanted to make sure that you were still alive.

251
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,620
I'm sorry for yesterday.

252
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,520
You need to change that bad habit of yours.

253
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,950
If you were anyone else, I would've sued you by now.

254
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,770
Why would you sue me for fighting with my dad?

255
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,390
- Your dad?
- Yes.

256
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,610
You already know.

257
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,340
I go through this process every time after fighting with my dad.

258
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,440
And I get completely and utterly drunk.

259
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,820
Well, you should go and give him an apology.

260
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,590
All right.

261
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,850
Next time, you should drink a bit less.

262
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,270
You shouldn't act like that with every person that takes you home.

263
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,320
What did I do?

264
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,490
You...

265
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,170
You yell and make a big scene every time you're drunk.

266
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,900
And you were almost taken in by the police.

267
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,720
Are you serious?

268
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,010
I don't remember anything that happened last night.

269
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,740
Welcome!

270
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,600
Hey, Dad, there are a few bottles over here.

271
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,560
Hey, you don't need to help out with that.

272
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,050
I'll take care of it.

273
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,690
- You don't need to trouble yourself with any of this.
- I can help you.

274
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,800
There's really no need. I can take care of it.

275
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,900
It's Sunday and you're still dressed like that.

276
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,240
Surely you haven't come by just to inspect my little shop.

277
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,330
I, as the owner of this little shop, cannot keep up with you, Lawyer Zheng.

278
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,680
You don't need to help me.

279
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,340
I can wait for a little to help Fu Ligong deal with this case.

280
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,950
No, you should go on ahead.

281
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,430
Hey, Dad, can we talk?

282
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,410
I'm sorry.

283
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,310
I was too headstrong yesterday.

284
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,010
I just don't want to make decisions about my life and marriage using that method.

285
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,270
If you don't want to go on blind dates, all you have to do is tell me.

286
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,860
Don't handle it the way you did last time.

287
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,250
In the future, I just won't have you go on anymore blind dates.

288
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,350
Besides, there's no one out there who would dare to go on a blind date with you two anyway.

289
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,160
In the future, you can go out there and find your happiness on your own.

290
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,950
- I don't even know why I'm worried about you.
- There has never been a need for you to worry about me.

291
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,570
Because I have you, Xueqing, Uncle Wang, and Fu Ligong.

292
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,550
You really know how to talk!

293
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,800
Here's your lunch.

294
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,620
When did you make this?

295
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,810
Oh, did you think that I was busy with something else?

296
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,830
I thought I wouldn't have lunch to eat today.

297
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,230
I did not expect to get lunch made with love!

298
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,190
All right, you should get going.

299
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,570
I can't thank you enough.

300
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,380
Don't you have work to do?

301
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,690
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

302
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,390
I love you!

303
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,540
All right, get going!

304
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,670
Dad, I'm heading out now!

305
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,940
I love you!

306
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,860
Seriously.

307
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,040
Luckily, I looked into Qi Tian's background, and it's pretty bad.

308
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,520
But you're focusing on Mrs. Ke's divorce proceedings, anyway.

309
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,570
You can hand everything else over to me.

310
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,910
But we don't get involved with criminal cases.

311
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,700
A few days ago, a couple of our friends from the criminal law group were discussing this case.

312
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,260
I let them take a look at the case.

313
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,550
Maybe there's a chance to catch him and send him to jail first.

314
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,710
Even if he has a chance to post bail,

315
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,180
that period of time may be sufficient enough to allow Mrs. Ke to proceed with the divorce smoothly.

316
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,990
But you know about Qi Tian's background.

317
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,870
Aren't you afraid of getting into trouble?

318
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,510
You're joking, right? I'm Zheng Zeshou.

319
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm a protector.

320
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,090
You're right. It's not our responsibility to judge.

321
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,270
Our duty is to bring the guilty to justice.

322
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,360
No matter what happens, you need to stay safe.

323
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,720
In this world, the vast majority of people enter into marriage

324
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,210
with someone that they do not truly love.

325
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,010
That's because when you're with someone,

326
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,600
you always think that your partner is your true love.

327
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,410
But after a long time of getting to know each other,

328
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,810
all of their advantages that existed before marriage, turn into disadvantages after marriage.

329
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,760
I won't feel sorry for myself in that way.

330
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm going to completely isolate myself from marriage. Those kinds of thoughts won't even be on my mind.

331
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,340
It's going to rain soon, we should get going.

332
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,290
Which restaurant do you want to eat at?

333
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,730
Why are there so many people in front of Mr. Jian's shop?

334
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,870
You leave stuff like this and play deafeningly loud music all the time. How can you mess up other people's storefronts?

335
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,990
What store front?

336
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,750
This is a laundromat and I'm the owner! Why do you do this all the time?

337
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,470
- So what then?
- Should we call the police?

338
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,560
You villains probably reported me first, didn't you?

339
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,480
What on earth is wrong with you?

340
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,170
You're the one who's standing in front of our storefront and prohibiting us from walking downstairs.

341
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,580
You're committing a crime and we can sue you. You know that, right?

342
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,290
- You...
- Exactly.
- You're not allowing us to do our business.

343
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,960
- And what are you holding that broom for anyway?
- And why do you think?

344
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,020
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

345
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,150
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

346
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,310
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

347
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,900
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

348
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,160
♫ I love you... ♫

349
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,270
♫ I miss you... ♫

350
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,680
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

351
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,430
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

352
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,500
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

353
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,730
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

354
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,740
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

355
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,360
Aren't you the boss of the laundry shop?

356
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,800
I…
