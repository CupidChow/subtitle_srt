22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,060
To the right, a little bit. To the left, a little bit.

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,960
To the right, a little bit more.

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,920
Yes, right there. That's correct.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,180
Ling Ling.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,980
Dad.

27
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,200
Sit down.

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,560
Dad, we arranged and put all of this together.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Really?

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,590
Lie down.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,590
I want to try it out. Is everything ready?

32
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,140
Three, two, one.

33
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,400
And you did all this?

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,470
Yes, because when we went camping,

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,060
we fell asleep, so we ended up not seeing the stars.

36
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,080
- Who fell asleep?
- I did.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,430
Which star is Dad?

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,900
The purple one.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,620
The purple star?

40
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,770
Not the small one, the big one.

41
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,520
Well, which star is Big Brother Yuki then?

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,950
It's the star above yours.

43
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,800
The star above mine, are you talking about that one?

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,140
No,

45
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,850
I said the star right above yours.

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,880
Well, why is Big Brother Yuki the sun?

47
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,700
Because I am your sunshine.

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,160
- Do you like love, Ling Ling?
- Yes.

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,020
Love suits you, Ling Ling.

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,510
Is love in the heavens, then?

51
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,340
Hi.

52
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,550
Actually, you don't need to bring a flower every day. It's okay.

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,820
I truly realized far too late how much I love you.

54
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,550
What are you doing with all this food?

55
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,830
I'm going to cook dinner for you later.

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,540
That's all right. I'll prepare dinner in a little bit.

57
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,500
Hello?

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,590
Brother.

59
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,860
What's up, Xueqing? I'm not going to get a drink today, you'll have to go by yourself.

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,550
Dad wanted me to tell you to come to the hospital.

61
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,770
Dad.

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,660
How long ago did you start talking to them?

63
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,980
Before the last time you went on a blind date.

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,590
But you didn't say that you'd actually made contact with her.

65
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,960
You don't even fully know now, do you?

66
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,790
What do you want me to say to you?

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,730
I called you and told you to go see your mother.

68
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,920
My wife.

69
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,910
Dad.

70
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,440
So, is she okay, then?

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,920
Is she okay?

72
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,440
The doctor says that it's a malignant tumor.

73
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,020
It's already in the terminal stage.

74
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,550
Little Qing, hold on to this, I'm going to take a walk.

75
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,860
- Dad.
- Dad, you...

76
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,580
This is the first time that I've seen my dad cry.

77
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,930
I can't understand.

78
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,160
Why is my dad still so sad when she clearly abandoned this family?

79
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,510
Is it just because...

80
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,660
she's going to pass away soon?

81
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,070
My feelings are very complicated right now.

82
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,670
I don't want to make my dad sad.

83
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,260
But I...

84
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,930
I will never forgive the woman that abandoned my family.

85
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,990
When two lovers finally meet for the last time,

86
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,390
and they're already on their deathbeds,

87
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,110
I think that even the largest amount of resentment will disappear.

88

You are my clone.

98
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,860
Reporting back,

99
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,690
Clones Number 2 and 3, have both been eliminated.

[THE END]

101
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,230
That was so dramatic. I feel like there will be a sequel, too.

102
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,040
But isn't that what a certain someone wanted to see?

103
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,840
I wanted to follow up and see what happened next.

104
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,390
You see, nowadays, many popular series are being made into movies.

105
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,960
Next time, we should look at the comments beforehand and then go to see it.

106
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,460
I don't think we necessarily need to look at other people's comments.

107
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,010
Watching movies is similar to drawing lots.

108
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,600
If you draw a bad lot, then you'll just begin to look at it from a different perspective.

109
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,810
For example, you can start looking at it as if it's a comedy.

110
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,290
Didn't you have a good time watching it just now?

111
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,440
Is your mood a little better now?

112
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,100
Thanks for taking me to the movies.

113
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,490
Hey, catch!

114
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,990
What are you doing with that?

115
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,340
- I wasn't ready.
- It's fine, I'll take another.

116
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,440
I'll give you another chance to take a good picture.

117
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,190
All right. Three... two... one...

118
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,990
What?

119
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,590
I just took Ling Ling to her mother's.

120
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,770
- How did this place get like this?
- Do you like it?

121
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,480
Do you think that table looks second-hand?

122
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,490
Isn't it your dream to make coffee for others to drink?

123
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,770
So there's a table, chairs, and this coffee machine.

124
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,850
You can make customers a cup of coffee when they come here.

125
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,510
Where are the clothes that I placed there?

126
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,850
I took care of them.

127
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,800
Did you throw them away?

128
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,980
I recycled them all.

129
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,550
Why did you throw them away?

130
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,810
To make space for these things.

131
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,920
But you can't just wantonly throw away other people's things.

132
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,320
They've been laying here for ten to twenty years.

133
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,390
And no one has come for them.

134
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,710
How do you know that?

135
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,760
Among these clothes,

136
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,310
there could be a boy's favorite shirt,

137
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,910
or a girl's most prized dress,

138
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,590
or a most precious memory that has slipped someone's mind because of their busy schedule.

139
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,880
Therefore, you're going to let these clothes hinder your life? You're going to let them impede your dreams?

140
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,860
Why are you saying that they're hindering my life?

141
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,890
- Well, why do they need to be here?
- Because they've just forgotten to pick up their clothes.

142
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,970
I just simply do not think...

143
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,160
that these memories can so easily be cast aside.

144
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,790
What are you smiling for?

145
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,060
I was thinking... that you clearly liked me for so long,

146
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,010
and after we finally started dating, you've taken a lot of time to get used to holding my hand in the street.

147
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,870
What?

148
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,670
Are you shy?

149
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,650
Zheng Zeshou!

150
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,840
Honey, let's go. Let's go home.

151
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,830
Dad!

152
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,070
Go, quickly!

153
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,900
Dad!

154
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,450
I don't want to talk to you.

155
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,700
Why are you angry?

156
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,710
Why am I angry?

157
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,910
You don't know why I'm angry?

158
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,680
I didn't mean to hide this from you.

159
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,230
I wanted you to care for Little Gong.

160
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,740
I didn't want you to...

161
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,880
care for him in this way!

162
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,360
- Did you start this or did he?
- Is that important?

163
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,040
You want to know then?

164
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,790
You want to know who started this? All right, fine. I did.

165
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,010
I like him! It's that simple, and we're not hurting anyone.

166
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,630
Do you not realize that your mother is dying?

167
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,600
You can't think about her a bit more, huh?

168
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,440
You want me to think more about her? Fine.

169
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,940
You want me to get married, settle down, and live a "happy" sham of a life?

170
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,920
A sham?

171
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,520
What are you calling a sham?

172
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,340
Do you think that mine and your mother's care for you was a sham?

173
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,500
We just hoped that you...

174
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,720
could find a partner...

175
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
get married, settle down, and have a family.

176
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,710
And have a happy life. You're calling this a sham?

177
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,680
Can I not be happy with Fu Ligong?

178
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,250
Can I not get married, settle down, and have a family with him?

179
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,770
If she weren't sick right now, would you still oppose Fu Ligong and I being together?

180
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,460
Why?

181
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,140
Why can't you just approve of me?

182
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,590
Dad.

183
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,220
Did you hear all of that?

184
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,180
We'll wait until your dad has calmed down a bit, then we can go back and clear things up with him.

185
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,450
Does he want to listen though?

186
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,650
I trust that after you talk things over with him, he'll understand.

187
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,030
If he can understand things,

188
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,440
do you think he would have forced me to go on blind dates

189
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,720
and force me to get married?

190
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,340
In the end, he didn't force you to go, right?

191
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,650
Your dad just needs a bit more time.

192
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,160
If you're willing to listen attentively to each other,

193
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,540
then that'll give you an opportunity to understand each other better.

194
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,140
Why do you keep helping and speaking up

195
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,970
for someone who opposes us and wants to break us up?

196
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,740
It's like this coin.

197
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,800
If you never give this a chance, you'll never know the answer.

198
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,450
Even if it's the opposite, we can face it together.

199
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,500
It's just like how we face divorce cases together.

200
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,640
Well then, don't throw it just yet.

201
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,770
That way, I won't have to receive an answer I don't want to know.

202
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,450
I'm sorry. I want to calm down a bit by myself.

203
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,920
Where is Big Brother Yuki?

204
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,570
Dad.

205
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,640
Big Brother Yuki...

206
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
He has already gone home.

207
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,630
Did you and Big Brother Yuki get into a fight?

208
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,040
Dad, you can't lie. Otherwise, I'll hate you.

209
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,130
Ling Ling, I want to ask you...

210
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,880
One day, if I threw away your favorite toys and books,

211
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,660
how would you feel?

212
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,740
Well, it would depend on whether I needed them or not.

213
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,800
If I already finished reading those books,

214
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,570
even if you threw them away, I wouldn't be upset.

215
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,580
But... do you understand?

216
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,260
Big Brother Yuki moved around

217
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,520
the decorations in my shop without getting my approval first.

218
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
And threw some clothes away.

219
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,880
That's great! They've finally been thrown away.

220
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,800
Dad, you're always helping to take care of other people's clothes.

221
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,340
But have you seen them return and pick up their clothes?

222
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,880
But...

223
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,370
Big Brother Yuki did it for your own good.

224
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,490
Don't you think it's better to throw those things out?

225
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,970
Don't you think it makes the space larger and more comfortable?

226
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,520
How are you sounding more and more like Big Brother Yuki when you speak?

227
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,480
It's because we both love you a lot.

228
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,150
All right, Dad. You need to get back on good terms with Big Brother Yuki.

229
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,630
Why are you being so absent-minded?

230
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,830
I was caught by Big Sis last time and had to make up for it.

231
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,350
And you dare to stand here in a daze?

232
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,030
You're not scared?

233
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,160
There's nothing too urgent going on right now.

234
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,660
Who said that?

235
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,480
I named this drink "Winter Shock."

236
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,800
How is it? Do you feel very shocked?

237
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,970
I feel ordinary.

238
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,380
How could you only feel ordinary? I'm going to have a sip.

239
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,270
Oh, it's terrible.

240
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,220
Do you have a little issue with your sense of taste?

241
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,700
Or do you have a cold?

242
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,560
I just need a little time to digest.

243
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,540
Digest?

244
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,640
Hi.

245
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,950
What are you doing here?

246
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,810
I developed the photos that we took this afternoon.

247
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,710
Do... you want to take a look?

248
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,490
And I have this, too.

249
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,980
I'm sorry.

250
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,600
I was too impulsive today.

251
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,900
Can you forgive me?

252
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,660
I said before, no matter what happens,

253
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,760
we can face it together.

254
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,750
I listened.

255
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,860
Can we arrange a time

256
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,680
to go and see my dad?

257
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,720
This is probably the first disagreement we've had since we started dating.

258
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,050
When you were ignoring me,

259
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,330
I really didn't know what to do.

260
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,790
All right. I won't ever be like that in the future again.

261
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,950
Do you want to watch a series?

262
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,720
Well... will you watch the first episode

263
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,620
of "Tu Bo Tu" with me?

264
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,560
I'll watch whatever you want with you.

265
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,490
You said that this will be pretty hard, right?

266
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,610
Aren't you two professionals?

267
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,710
Yes, please listen to me.

268
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,260
If both parties reach a consensus, then there will be no issues, of course.

269
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,720
But right now, the only reasoning that we have is yours, which is that you no longer love your husband.

270
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,480
And there is no way that alone will constitute a sufficient element for divorce.

271
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Therefore, I must have one of those reasons that you stated before, is that right?

272
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,020
It is not possible to unilaterally petition for divorce,

273
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,150
unless your cause meets one of the ten statutory reasons.

274
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,150
If you want to get a divorce for a reason such as incompatible personalities, it is truly impossible.

275
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,290
And what if I must get a divorce?

276
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,240
Mrs. Wang, I apologize. I believe this is the most direct way of dealing with this.

277
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,330
Sit, please.

278
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,870
Hello, I'm the lawyer that will be responsible for this matter this time. My surname is Zheng.

279
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm aware. Lawyer Fu just gave me an introduction.

280
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,910
So, you really found a lawyer to take care of this?

281
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,170
I originally thought I wasn't going to sign the papers and that we didn't need a divorce.

282
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,960
Actually, this is how things are. But do you really think this is a good method?

283
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,010
I apologize. May I trouble you to take care of this matter for us? Thank you.

284
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,760
All right. I will draw up an agreement here.

285
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,290
There's no need for that.

286
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,230
I always carry it around with me.

287
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,220
Are you still thinking about today's case?

288
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,190
He let her go for the sake of helping her achieve what she wanted, and they're separated now.

289
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,810
It's hard to imagine, how determined that man was.

290
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,530
Perhaps it was because he felt the determination and resoluteness of his wife.

291
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,720
And because he loves her, he, therefore, decided to let her go, and rather bring that pain upon himself.

292
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,670
Do you think that woman is very selfish, then?

293
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,840
Regardless of their separation,

294
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,060
when it comes to emotional choices, who isn't selfish?

295
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,640
You just can't cause yourself to have any regrets.

296
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,160
I'll always be by your side.

297
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,390
Let's go and see your dad.

298
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,770
- Do you have everything?
- Dad.

299
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,220
Mr. Zheng.

300
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,360
What... are you two doing here?

301
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,290
I just happened to be going to the hospital. We can talk about it afterward.

302
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,780
Fu Ligong and I are here, why are you avoiding us?

303
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,790
Dad, same-sex marriage has passed now. Don't be so old-fashioned and inflexible.

304
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,190
What is going on right now?

305
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm the bad guy, right?

306
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,570
Mr. Zheng, that's not how I feel.

307
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,340
Little Gong, I know that's not what you mean.

308
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,150
Little Gong, you've always been a good kid.

309
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,680
Don't you know what I'm thinking?

310
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,270
So, let me ask you.

311
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,460
What do you want to talk about with me?

312
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,050
He and I are going to see Uncle Wang together.

313
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,760
We're going to go and chat with him, just like how he insisted that I come here and talk with you.

314
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,480
What on Earth do you two want to talk about with me?

315
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,180
We've already thought it over.

316
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,700
Regardless of what happens,

317
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,030
we're going to face it together.

318
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,110
Please understand us.

319
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,940
Mr. Zheng, I promise you.

320
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,170
I will always be with Zeshou.

321
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,740
What is this?

322
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,930
It's a letter to you, from your mom.

323
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,160
Your mother is already in a coma now.

324
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,180
She knew that she wouldn't have a way to speak with you again.

325
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,090
Everything that she wanted to tell you before she fell into a coma,

326
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,270
is in this letter.

327
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,040
You must remember. You have a mother that loves you very much.

328
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,950
Lock the door when you leave.

329
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,750
Zeshou, I'm sorry.

330
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,880
At that time, when I willfully left you...

331
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,440
Actually, I felt regret very quickly thereafter.

332
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,650
I shouldn't have only thought of myself.

333
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,710
I caused you and Xueqing to have a broken family from a small age.

334
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,680
However, I didn't dare to return.

335
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,830
I was afraid that you two wouldn't willingly accept me.

336
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,300
After you all moved,

337
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,000
I continued and always lived in our old neighborhood.

338
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,460
And I secretly watched you and Xueqing grow up.

339
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,590
I even imagined returning to your sides, and living with you again.

340
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,060
Even though I knew that I had no right to see you two,

341
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,210
I still hoped that you would be able to establish your own happy families.

342
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,630
And live a simple and happy life.

343
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,990
Zeshou, I'm not a good mother.

344
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,090
You don't have to forgive me,

345
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,520
but you must always be happy.

346
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,410
Why?

347
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,110
Why does she get to arbitrarily decide what's good for us?

348
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,830
Why does she think she knows what kind of life we should lead?

349
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,140
Why didn't she try, even

350
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,640
one time, to see us when she was healthy?

351
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,490
Why did she have to wait until she was seriously ill and about to die?

352
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,040
And why does this suddenly make me feel like I'm the one who's done something wrong?

353
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,340
You haven't done anything wrong.

354
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,910
Perhaps... your mother had a reason that she didn't dare to share with you.

355
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,490
Don't worry, I'll always be by your side.

356
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,280
I'm fine.

357
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,850
Okay, I'm going to go take a shower.

358
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,380
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

359
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,530
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

360
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,630
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

361
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,290
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

362
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,650
♫ I love you... ♫

363
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,600
♫ I miss you... ♫

364
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,110
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

365
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,710
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

366
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,820
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

367
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,150
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

368
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:23,120
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

369
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,640
♫ I wish you could feel how I feel ♫

370
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,070
Fu Ligong!

371
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,820
Thank you for liking me!
