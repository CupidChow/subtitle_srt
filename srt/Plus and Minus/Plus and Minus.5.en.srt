She thought that I did the same thing every day. She thought my life was completely uninteresting.

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,430
And then she wasn't able to take it anymore.

150
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,620
So... is that why you two got divorced?

151
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,660
Although we didn't stay together as husband and wife, we have become great friends.

152
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,310
Besides, we have Ling Ling too.

Do you regret getting divorced?

No.

155
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,830
If you only care about how you feel and don't take the feelings of others into account,

156
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,110
it means that you're forcing the relationship on the other person, and both of you are struggling to be together.

157
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,090
And that can be pretty painful.

00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,030
is not a terrible thing.

160
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,770
Cheers!

161
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,070
What are you drinking?

162
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,870
This drink is called "The Courage of the Laundromat Owner."

163
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,900
I think it's been really wonderful getting to know you.

164
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,920
I didn't greet you all when you moved in here.

165
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,150
I did not expect that we would first meet each other on that occasion.

166
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm really... I'm really sorry.

167
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,270
We won't be saying "I'm sorry" today. Just say "Thank you."

168
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,650
What are some of your usual interests?

169
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,900
Coffee.

170
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,460
Coffee isn't just something to drink, but also something...

171
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,980
to brew.

172
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,080
You have to separate out the amounts of soft water and hard water that are used.

173
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,440
Different types of water will produce different kinds of quality and texture.

174
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,610
And then there are the beans. There are various types of beans: bitter beans, sour beans,

175
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,440
They're all a little different.

176
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,850
Some people like to grind their own beans by hand,

177
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,190
and others prefer to have a machine to grind them. But I prefer to grind my own by hand.

178
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,650
Have you thought about opening up your own coffee shop before?

179
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,270
After you reach a certain age,

180
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,070
people become afraid of change.

181
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,010
And at that point, their lives become fixed.

182
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,060
Or perhaps it has nothing to do with age.

183
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,030
Many people have encouraged me and told me to

184
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,650
get rid of the laundromat and all the clothes.

185
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,320
But what about all those memories?

186
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,680
Has anyone ever told you how pretty your eyes are?

187
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,430
Stop messing with me.

188
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,990
I've just been trying to focus on how I can take good care of Ling Ling as she grows up.

189
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,880
You're a good father.

190
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,680
But you should consider your own needs sometimes, too.

191
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,290
So do all of your drinks taste like this?

192
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,520
I'll make another for you.

193
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,760
Maybe I'm the one taking care of you.

194
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,070
I will always... be by your side.

195
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,340
Good morning.

196
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,360
It's still so early. You should sleep for a bit more.

197
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,060
Are you looking for these?

198
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,070
Do you want to sleep for a bit longer?

199
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,710
I... just wait a minute. I need to ask you about what happened.

200
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,420
Hi, Lawyer Zheng and Lawyer Fu.

201
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,210
Lawyer Fu, what happened to your arm?

202
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,340
It's just a minor injury, I'm fine.

203
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm glad we didn't make this trip in vain. We thought it might be a public holiday.

204
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,330
A public holiday? Why would you think that?

205
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,540
Isn't the time...

206
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,660
Oh, it's so late!

207
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,770
What did he just say? Didn't he say it was really early?

208
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,650
What?

209
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,430
Oh, nothing.

210
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,430
I'll just take care of these like I usually do.

211
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,720
- Oh, that'd be great.
- Okay.

212
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,040
Just give me a minute.

213
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,080
Yuki.

214
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,290
Hi, Lawyer Zheng, Lawyer Fu. Do you guys need more of your clothes washed?

215
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,900
Oh, I understand the relationship between Mr. Jian and Yuki now.

216
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,700
That's great.

217
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,730
No, no. Well...

218
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,510
He just stayed over at my place last night.

219
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,390
We got drunk last night, and then...

220
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,150
Well, he didn't sleep over at my place, he just needed to rest.

221
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,570
So that's why you woke up so late today.

222
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,160
No!

223
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,600
What I meant was...

224
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,090
What exactly did you mean...?

225
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,210
What he meant was that we went to bed late last night.

226
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,260
- No, no!
- We have other things to do.

227
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,970
- Thanks for taking care of our clothes, Mr. Jian.
- What are you doing?

228
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,580
- Wait a minute, hold on.
- Goodbye!

229
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,850
So... what kind of relationship do we have now?

230
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,690
♫ You're my rabbit, I want to hold you tight ♫

231
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,180
What do you think?

232
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,490
♫ You're my baby, the alarm keeps ringing all because of you ♫

233
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,050
Do you hate me?

234
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,930
♫ Don't be shy anymore ♫

235
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,230
Do you like me?

236
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,110
♫ It's getting out of control, where do I hide? ♫

237
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,370
♫ One positive and negative encounter will cancel each other out ♫

238
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,760
♫ What? What do I not have? ♫

239
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,450
♫ Let it go, love is in your hands ♫

240
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,090
♫ Ask me directly, speak out ♫

241
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,480
Then we should be together.

242
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,700
♫ I love you more and more and more ♫

243
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,530
Don't you think that's moving a bit fast?

244
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,910
Isn't love something that occurs suddenly?

245
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,670
♫ Oh my baby, don't you, don't you wanna chase me? ♫

246
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,310
♫ You're my baby, the alarm keeps ringing all because of you ♫

247
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,220
♫ Don't be shy anymore ♫

248
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Can I...

249
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,420
think about it?

250
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,990
- Hello.
- Excuse me. Who are you?

251
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,930
- I'm here to get a divorce.
- I'm here to get a divorce.

252
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,810
Can you first tell me why you two want a divorce?

253
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,090
I feel like he changed after we got married.

254
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,470
And with things as they are, I can't stand it anymore.

255
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,990
How have you made that judgment?

256
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,740
Before marriage, everyone puts in a lot of work together.

257
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,140
Who knew that after marriage, you communicate less and less.

258
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,400
Furthermore, he's become increasingly dominant.

259
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,480
When we first got together, I respected him. Of course.

260
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,080
But who knew that later things would become so critical?

261
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,940
I really can't go on like this.

262
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,040
Of course, I still want to respect his decision.

263
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,780
But after we got married, he's instead been arguing over who's dominant.

264
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,280
I've told him that he's impatient.

265
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,220
I don't know. Perhaps our views are just too different.

266
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,830
He has an obstinate personality. He doesn't listen to anything I have to say.

267
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,520
- So you've clearly explained your intentions to him?
- Yes.

268
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,300
He says that he knows I have good intentions toward him.

269
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,090
But he thought that I was doing too much.

270
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,220
But now I really don't care anymore.

271
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,730
I was trying to communicate with him. I would listen to him.

272
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,490
And I hoped that he could understand how I thought and felt more.

273
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,940
But instead, he was constantly rejecting me.

274
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,450
Actually, he's my first love.

275
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,190
And then you decided to get married.

276
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,790
It was too quick, don't you think?

277
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,500
At first, I also thought I was being too impulsive.

278
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,950
Actually, before we were together, of course, I wanted to face everything together with him.

279
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,910
Otherwise, why would I have done all those things and cared about him? Right?

280
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,260
It's just that I'm really tired now.

281
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,560
I really never thought that we'd be getting a divorce.

282
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,270
So there's really no need for you to take more time to think about this?

283
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,630
I've thought about whether or not to get a divorce every day.

284
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,720
Because he was the first one to talk about wanting to get married,

285
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,660
But if I file for divorce now, won't I then become the unilaterally-minded and unreasonable person?

286
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,530
But anyway, I really can't take it anymore.

287
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,590
Why should I make myself so tired all the time?

288
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,910
Will you accept my case?

289
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,220
Will you help me file for divorce?

290
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,930
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

291
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,100
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

292
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,100
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

293
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,760
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

294
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,940
♫ I love you... ♫

295
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,940
♫ I miss you... ♫

296
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,240
♫ The lies are stuck in my heart inch by inch ♫

297
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,290
♫ Carved in my bones and engraved in my heart,
I long to see you again ♫

298
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,210
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

299
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,620
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

300
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,600
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

301
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,450
♫ I wish you could feel how I feel ♫

302
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,650
Do you believe in fate?
