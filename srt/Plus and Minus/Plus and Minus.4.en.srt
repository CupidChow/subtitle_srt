I have the king this time.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,390
I want to raise the stakes and excitement of this game.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,560
I want whoever has the two of spades to kiss whoever has the ace of spades.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,720
Classmate, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,000
I can drink. You don't have to kiss me, really.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,930
We'll have plenty of time to drink. Come on now.

29

- Kiss!
- Kiss!

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,030
- Kiss again!
- Again!

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,710
- You don't want to kiss one more time?
- No!

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,140
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

33
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,310
That was a real kiss. He really got his fill today.

Okay, I'll have another drink first.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,670
Classmate, you're both drinking and playing.

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,930
Right.

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,640
Well going forward, if I don't perform the task then I'll have two drinks. Okay?

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,720
Is that really what you're saying?

Why did you leave?

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,960
It wasn't that fun anymore. After you left, the vibe wasn't the same.

46
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,710
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,400
What are you apologizing for? You said you didn't feel well.

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,100
What's going on? What's wrong?

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,060
Or are you just not in a good mood?

50
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,930
I promise I won't make you go to this kind of party again.

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,430
- It's fine.
- It had better be fine.

52
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,740
You don't usually call me anyway.

53
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,860
Why are we at our old school?

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,910

Are you sure you want to go?

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,510
It's been decided. Besides, Xiaoyu and the others are already waiting for us on the roof.

62
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,190
It seems like I've been forcing you to do all sorts of things for a long time.

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,560
Birthday parties, eating noodles,

64
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,270
drinking, watching TV series.

65
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,870
Even my latest plan to deal with our blind dates.

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,390
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,710
There are just so many things that I want to do with you by my side.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,230
If you don't want to go, then we can just go home.

69

We're already here, so why don't we go up and take a look?

I don't know how any of those classmates are doing now.

It seems like we're the only single ones left, though.

- What are you saying?
- It's true!

75
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,540
Also, do you remember that one thing?

76
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,140
Do you remember when that security guard ran after Lucky that day?

77
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,430
Are you talking about when that security guard was scared away by Lucky's screams?

78
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,410
Yes, exactly. That guard thought she was a ghost.

79
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,260
Lucky became a legend on campus after that.

80
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,310
Do you think her husband knows about that?

81
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,550
A certain someone did not plan that birthday party too well.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,930
But it was a lot of fun.

83
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,280
We were right here.

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,060
I was incredibly nervous because we were trying to avoid that security guard.

85
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,380
To be honest, I think my gift to you was better than the book you gave me.

86
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm just joking. Actually, it was a really good book.

87
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,240
When did you take that?

88
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,650
This is so old.

89
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,390
I really should get you a new one.

90
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,010
Give it back to me.

91
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,100
I fell asleep right after I gave you that.

92
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,190
I was asleep until dawn.

93
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,990
You were completely asleep until dawn, and you only had two cans of beer.

94
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,280
You were sleeping so long, even the students who came early in the morning to study saw you.

95
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,160
And what about my present?

96
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,720
This book is really good.

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,230
I have to read books in class.

98
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,520
And so you gave me another book to read? No, I can't read anymore.

99
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,410
I need to sleep. I'm going to sleep.

Do you remember that street vendor?

101
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,120
I went to see him.

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,550
He said that some other weirdo

103
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,720
bought the corresponding key ring.

104
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,870
It seems that that weirdo... is you.

105
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,710
I thought you were possessed there for a minute.

106
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,710
Fortunately, you finally moved around.

107
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,980
We have to go to court tomorrow. We should head back soon and go to bed.

108

Those two lawyers seldom leave so early.

109
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,110
Since they brought so many people with them, I thought they would stay a bit later.

Do you know that the moon shines simply because it reflects the sun's rays?

112
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,500
If there were no sun, and even if the moon could shine on its own,

113
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,620
it wouldn't be as interesting.

114
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,390
So what?

115
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,590
I just have a way with words.

116
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,620
So, do you think

117
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,390
that if the moon could shine on its own

118
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,190
that it could become as bright as the sun for someone?

119
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,640
Well... I put the stock order over there by the register.

120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360

I left my keys and phone in the bar when I went to take out the trash.

And you're the only one still here?

Do you want to come into my shop and call someone?

- Of course.

Great.

Did no one answer your call?

No.

It's fine. I can go out and get some more in a bit.

Well, thank you so much.

I saw your name tag.

My father is Japanese, but I don't speak Japanese too well.

No wonder. I was going to say, you don't have an accent.

Have you lived in Taiwan for a long time?

143
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,750
My father passed away a long time ago. I've lived in Taiwan with my mother for a while.

144
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,820
I'm sorry, I didn't know...

It's fine.

146

I don't really have a strong impression of my father. I've mostly just looked at him in photos,

147
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,880
to get to know him better.

When I ran into you last time, was that your daughter with you?

Oh, are you talking about Ling Ling?

Yes, she's very cute.

151
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,640
But I don't see her very often.

152

She mostly lives with my ex-wife.

She mostly comes here and spends time with me during the holidays.

Do you need to start working?

- Can I?
- Certainly.

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,390
This is the place that I got when I took over the laundromat.

161
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,800
It's pretty convenient to live here.

162
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,070
You can lie down here and rest for a bit. It's no problem.

163
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,110
There are some toiletries in the bathroom that you can help yourself to,

164
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,410
if you want to take a shower.

165
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,420
And as for a change of clothes...

166
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,270
Some previous customers have left clothes here,

167
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,900
and I've already washed them.

168
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,560
So you don't have to worry about wearing them.

169
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:05,010
[Shilin Investigative Court]

170
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,730
Mrs. Ke, hello!

171
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,370
And you are...?

172
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,980
I'm a colleague of Mr. Fu's. My name is Mr. Zheng.

173
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,050
Just now, did the investigative procedure go well?

174
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,740
How did you know that I was just—

175
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,650
Your procedure was led by a prosecutor that I know.

176
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,050
After all, since we're not dealing with criminal liability, we can seek help from friendly contacts.

177
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,700
- Oh, I see. So it was you.
- Forgive me.

178
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,970
But I've been focusing on the background investigation into Mr. Qi,

179
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,480
because I think only that will be able to give you peace of mind.

180
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,820
Thank you, but I'm sorry for all the trouble.

181
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,860
I didn't tell Mr. Fu about those matters...

182
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,760
Because you were afraid of retaliation?

183
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,670
- You need to watch yourself.
- It's fine, let's go.

184
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,170
It's fine, let's go.

185
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,830
Don't worry, Lawyer Fu and I have taken care of this.

186
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,580
He's not going to touch you.

187
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm afraid that I've given you a lot to deal with.

188
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,520
Not at all. This is our job and our duty.

189
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,550
But in the future, if we need anything further from you,

190
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,820
we'll let you know.

191
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,400
All right, thank you both.

192
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,690
Mr. Jian!

193
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,920
What's wrong?

194
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,810
How do I use this?

195
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,550
It's kind of broken.

196
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,460
I'll fix it, then it'll be fine. Give me a few minutes.

197
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,150
I'm sorry to bother you.

198
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,420
That's strange... it was fine yesterday.

199
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,120
Do you need any help?

200
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,470
No, no. I'll take care of it.

201
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,990
Do you want to call someone to fix it?

202
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,660
No, no, that's okay.

203
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,680
I can take care of it.

204
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,730
That's weird.

205

♫ Oh my baby, don't you, don't you wanna chase me? ♫

215

I'm going to ask someone to fix it.

216
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,990

223
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,760
You're going to catch a cold.

224
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,330
Right.

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,790
♫ Ask me directly, speak out ♫

226

♫ I love you more and more and more ♫

227
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,320
Everyone's already gone. Why haven't you left yet?

228
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,030
Dad, Zheng Zeshou hasn't returned yet.

229
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,250
Isn't it always like this?

230
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,130
Is it?

231
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,040
You seem to be very concerned about him today.

232
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,650
No, it just seems like he's been in court for a while today.

233
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,190
What happened?

234
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,100
Zheng Zeshou's right there.

235
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,050
This boy was really worried about you.

236
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,160
Dad, you're being dramatic.

237
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,190
We finally filed a formal lawsuit today.

238
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,060
Did it go smoothly?

239
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,220
Not quite.

240
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,000
At the moment, the most likely direction for the prosecution to move in is a deferred prosecution.

241
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,590
All I can seem to do is continue to consult my colleagues with any information I have related to the Qi Tian case.

242
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,890
I heard.

243
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,700
His lawyer is really difficult to deal with.

244
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,100
But I think this battle is worth fighting.

245
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,970
At any rate, the process for this case is moving along.

246
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,060
But in the end, it will depend on the prosecutor.

247
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,020
But I personally hope he'll be in custody after the next session in court.

248
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,370
Fu Ligong, Mrs. Ke is one of the witnesses in this criminal case.

249
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,550
It's all right, all we can do is try our best.

250
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,610
In my opinion, being able to protect important people is true justice.

251
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,360
Lawyer Zheng, why are you protecting Mrs. Ke?

252
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,710
What I mean to say is that I protect those I think are important.

253
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,150
Is that really how it is?

254
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,010
So, are you going to worship me or not?

255
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,800
Come on, my shoulder is a little sore.

256
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,030
Of course.

257
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,040
Is this okay?

258
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,720
Stop making trouble.

259
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,160
You should get off work and go rest.

260
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,820
Zhong Hou, come with me to take care of this case.

261
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,180
- All right. Goodbye, Uncle Wang.
- I'm going to head out now.

262
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,800
Zhong Hou, you owe me.

263
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,860
You haven't been threatened recently, have you?

264
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,030
What do you mean? Why are you asking me that?

265
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,620
You go to court often. Qi Tian and his subordinates have surely seen you.

266
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,810
I know, I know.

267
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,910
And I wanted to thank you. You've helped me a lot.

268
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,630
Brothers always plan together, right?

269
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,700
I'm a messenger of justice. Even Zhong Hou is worshipping me.

270
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,300
What's wrong?

271
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,500
Xueqing said my dad asked us to go to his restaurant for dinner tonight.

272
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,260
Do you want to come?

273
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,310
I can't make it today. I still have some things to take care of for Mrs. Ke's case.

274
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,550
I'm actually ahead of schedule, it's a little scary.

275
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,490
Please be careful.

276
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,590
What is it?

277
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,540
I just wanted to ask you why you look so weird.

278
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,020
I'm thinking about some things.

279
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,220
Usually, when I ask you to dinner, you say no. But you agreed today.

280
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,480
What about Ligong?

281
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,190
Oh, does he have to be with us?

282
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,750
He's always with us. And you're always asking about "Brother Ligong." I'm your brother.

283
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,800
Please, don't be like that.

284
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,930
Brother Ligong makes a concerted effort when he does something, he takes things seriously.

285
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,050
He's very caring when he focuses on others.

286
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,340
And among the people that I know, that trait is hard to come by.

287
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,690
Brother Ligong is simply a super perfect brother.

288
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,580
Oh, is that what you think? Am I not perfect?

289
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,280
What's wrong? Why are you making that face at me?

290
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,960
You're the one with a bad look on your face. What's wrong with you?

291
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,210
What's the matter? Are you and Brother Ligong...?

292
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,020
Don't worry, I won't say anything to Dad.

293
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,450
What on earth are you thinking about?

294
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,650
If you're not going to tell me, then I'm just going to call Brother Ligong myself.

295
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,420
- Xueqing?
- Hi, Brother Ligong!

296
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,840
What are you up to?

297
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,750
I'm still at work.

298
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,060
Xueqing, run!

299
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,620
Hurry!

300
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,060
What's wrong?

301
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,790
Brother Ligong, come and save us! Fast!

302
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,520
We're in Da Shu park right now!

303
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,580
Wait! Wait!

304
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,720
Xueqing, are you okay?

305
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,680
- Brother, I can't go that fast.
- Hurry! Come on!

306
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,730
You can really run, Lawyer Zheng.

307
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,040
Kill him.

308
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,820
♫ This feeling... I'm still infatuated ♫

309
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,920
♫ A line that can't be crossed ♫

310
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,020
♫ That moment... of touching ♫

311
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,660
♫ Only exists between positive and negative ♫

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:59,170
♫ My longing for you still resides in that room ♫

317
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,540
♫ I want to hold you again, to hold you tighter ♫

318
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,510
♫ The phrase "I love you" is still on the right side of the bed ♫

319
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:15,190
♫ I wish you could feel how I feel ♫

320
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm going to stay at your house for a few days.
