1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,850
   
   

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,780
   
   

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,230
   

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,180
   

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,690
     

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,190
   

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,050
   

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,120
   

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,700
   

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:51,290
   

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,980


12
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,470
 That's when I realized 

13
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:43,410
 that for you, doing your best means making yourself pathetic and cowardly. 

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,480
This place is the same.

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Although five years passed already.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,560
- Jeong Dae Hyeon— 
 - You became famous.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,540
I saw the news.

18
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,110
You even have a girlfriend.

19
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,290
- Dae Hyeon— 
 - But does that woman know?

20
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,810
That she's dating only a shell, who's a fake?

21
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm getting married.

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,650
I don't want to explain myself to you about what happened back then.

23
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,490
Stop coming to me like this and

24
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,030
stop fixing these things for me.

25
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,760
You should also focus on your happiness and move on.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
I've been thinking about this all the way here.

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,560
What am I trying to do by going to see someone I'm done with?

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,810
I think I know now.

29
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,570
Lee Do Han,

30
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,260
it looks like...

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,150
I want to scar you.

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,570
So, I'm going to give it a try.

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,370
While only focusing on my happiness.

34
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,200
   
   

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,090
You'll be reminded of me again when this goes out of order.

36
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,320
Hit me up again, then.

37
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,290
   

38
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,250
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail- 

39
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,880
Gosh, this is nuts.

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,860
Lee Ji Han.

41
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,680
Lee Ji Han.

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,730
Gosh! Get yourself together, seriously.

43
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,580
Na A Jeong, stand straight, please.

44
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,260
Are you drunk?

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,480
You can lean on me. I'll take you home.

46
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,700
I should've known. I wondered why he drank the alcohol in my place.

47
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,700
If you were going to give me such a hard time,

48
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,670
why did you offer me your hand there? Your hand.

49
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,130
You were happy to grab it back then.

50
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,600
You got mad at me when I was getting dissed earlier.

51
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,430
Lee Ji Han, my house is 20 minutes on foot and five minutes by bicycle from here.

52
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,790
I could've already been home, washed up, and lying down by now.

53
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,110
Must I be reflecting on my morals here because of you?

54
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,160
This isn't the Pacific Ocean. They're my shoulders!

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,650
You're surprised because they're too broad, right?

56
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,530
That's why you're trying not to lean on me, right? I can just tell!

57
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,420
- Seriously. 
 - Why?

58
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,300
You don't like my shoulders?

59
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,200
In that case...

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,530
You said it takes 20 minutes on foot and

61
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,220
five minutes on a bicycle. Right?

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,520
I'll get you there in three minutes, then!

63
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,910
Hey!

64
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,690
Let go!

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
Let go! Let go!

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,340
Let go!

67
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,390
Lee Ji Han.

68
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,460
Lee Ji Han, wake up!

69
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,590
Lee Ji Han.

70
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,540
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

71
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,060
The boat's leaving in 10 minutes. Let's hurry.

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,760
Hyung, it looks like I'll have to go back to Seoul.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,830
My Ji Han has never declined my calls for more than an hour.

74
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,940
He even calls me day and night on my days off, bothering me.

75
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,690
But look! He's been unreachable for 12 hours now.

76
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,150
D-Does this make sense?

77
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,330
Taek, this is an illness.

78
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,180
It's the weekend, so he must be sleeping in or something!

79
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,990
Sleeping in?

80
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,940
Oh, no! He must be dead or have been kidnapped!

81
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,680
 All the alcohol is gone. She can leave now, right? 

82
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,670
 I think I like you enough to get pissed off if someone insulted you. 

83
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,650
 You, Na A Jeong. 

84
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,380
Like you, my foot.

85
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,730
Feet.

86
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,070
Why did you go to that woman?

87
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,200
Hand.

88
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Why did you offer it to her?

89
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,410
Brain.

90
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,520
Why do you keep caring about that woman?

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,670
Carrot?

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,930
You're the uncle who bought my mat, right?

93
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,740
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Jo Ji Ho.

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,370
This one is one of my favorites.

95
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,420
But I'll sell it to you for 5,000 won.

96
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,150
- Where are we? 
 - This is Aunt's room.

97
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,390
Right. So why am I in your aunt's room?

98
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,830
My aunt carried you on her back last night.

99
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,800
My aunt's really strong.

100
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,910
What's with this dingy shirt?

101
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,320
No way, did I vomit?

102
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Did I?

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,110
Mom made you honey water, and you spat it back out,

104
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,350
saying you hate sweet stuff.

105
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,760
Okay.

106
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,810
I'll buy that from you.

107
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,640
Really?

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,460
Instead, see if your aunt is outside.

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,850
If you help me go without your aunt knowing,

110
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,950
all this money will be yours, Ji Ho.

111
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,580
Okay.

112
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,510
Aunt's not outside right now.

113
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,270
Okay.

114
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,650
I was right, wasn't I?

115
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,800
Aunt's not here, right?

116
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,220
But she's the only one who's not here.

117
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,230
Goodness gracious, all right.

118
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,230
You're awake.

119
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,750
Wash up and have breakfast.

120
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,770
I rushed to prepare them,

121
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,710
but I'm not sure if you'll like them, In-law.

122
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,350
Thank you for the meal, but I'm not your in-law.

123
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,740
- What? 
 - My brother and your daughter didn't marry yet.

124
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,390
Oh, right.

125
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,150
And who's the one who got wasted and was carried into the in-laws-to-be's house?

126
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,240
Gosh, it's salty.

127
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
- Hey, look— 
 - By the way,

128
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,660
we all have to go out to take care of business, so help yourself and leave.

129
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,010
- Did we have something to do? 
 - Y-Yes, you know...

130
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,240
- Oh, really? 
 - Honey? Ji Ho.

131
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,640
- Come here. 
 - Wait, why?

132
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,290
- Huh? 
 - Let's talk outside.

133
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,250
 We had nothing to do. 

134
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,460
One word from you and look at us.

135
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,840
Why do we have to get kicked out of our house?

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,580
I just didn't know what to say.

137
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Anyhow, Honey, is my cooking salty these days?

138
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,640
Gosh, I should've put less salt in the soup.

139
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,030
Gosh, forget it. He would've said it's bland, then.

140
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,420
That jerk just doesn't like us, not the soup.

141
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,270
I like that uncle, though.

142
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,920
You know, he showed up dressed in money from head to toe last time

143
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,960
and dragged Sis to go with him without any explanation.

144
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,460
But the point is the infamous Na A Jeong didn't say a word and got in his car.

145
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,750
- A Jeong did? 
 - She didn't say a word?

146
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,260
Yes!

147
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:20,220
I think Sis is feeling really down right now because she's marrying a conglomerate.

148
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,640
Don't you think her brother-in-law-to-be will actually be the biggest problem?

149
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,380
He's already giving Sis a hard time even before she enters the wedding hall, thinking he has the right.

150
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,820
Right?

151
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,280
I mean, he looked clean-cut.

152
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,360
I guess his personality's completely different from his brother's.

153
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,750
Mother.

154
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,780
They say to look at a person's eyes to see their nature, not the face, right?

155
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,360
But that in-law's eyes just glare the wrong way.

156
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,760
 His eyes are already humongous, and they're too glaring, on top of that. 

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,040
The swallow was grateful and brought gourd seeds. 
  (Referring to Korean folktale) 

158
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,150
The magpie was grateful and sacrificed its life.

159
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,950
But why is Lee Ji Han, a human being, the only one who is ungrateful and turning on me?

160
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,950
Speaking of, what kind of nonsense is this, Na A Jeong?

161
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,450
This is clearly kidnapping.

162
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,500
As soon as I woke up, the scammer kid and the flowery blanket.

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,870
Do you know how flustered I was?

164
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,510
I was going to call the police, but the warm meal changed my mind. Just so you know.

165
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,950
You don't remember what happened last night?

166
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,720
You don't.

167
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,770
You said your shoulders were as broad as the pacific ocean, but I guess your memory's as narrow as a stream.

168
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,190
What about last night?

169
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,640
I brought you out of the hotel,

170
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,900
I apologized, and it's the end. Isn't it?

171
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,350
I thought you'd be like this. So I recorded it all.

172
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,710
Here's the first evidence to prevent you from feigning ignorance.

173
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,440
 Come out now. 

174
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,380
 Come out. Are you sleeping, huh? 

175
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,130
 Please enter it again. 

176
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,370
 Gosh! Hey, are you looking down on me? 

177
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,650
 Open up while I'm being nice. 

178
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,420
 Hey, we're at a club! 

179
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,350
 Beep, bop, beep, bop. 

180
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,260
 Ji Ho, record me, please. 

181
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,040
 Carrot? 

182
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,620
 - Mom! 
 - Wait... 

183
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,150
 Gosh, help me, please. 

184
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,860
 G-Gosh, why are you all gathered here? 

185
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,010
 - Honey. 
 - O-Open the door! 

186
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,540
 I don't want it. I hate sweet stuff! 

187
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,820
 Gosh, we need to change his clothes. I'm sure this is an expensive shirt. 

188
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,760
 - Mom. 
 - Hey, hey, hey. 

189
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,830
 Stop recording and wipe him. 

190
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,830
 He's your brother-in-law, not mine! 

191
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,670
 - This is uncomfortable. I'm taking it off! 
 - Gosh- 

192
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,490
 He's nuts! 

193
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,520
Well, did your sense of conscience return?

194
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,360
What's that?

195
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,750
Give it.

196
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,990
I said hand it over!

197
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,040
What would you have done without me?

198
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,650
You'd have passed out on the hotel floor.

199
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,000
It would've been cold and embarrassing, and you would've been totally humiliated.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,250
And who'd hear it? Your grandfather.

201
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,520
It's better to die on the streets than to be humiliated like this.

202
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,510
You blackmailer.

203
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,710
Blackmailing is your specialty. What I'm doing right now is negotiating.

204
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,700
I'll erase it for you.

205
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,310
But acknowledge it.

206
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,400
Acknowledge what?

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,050
That I will never fall for you, nor anyone else.

208
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,980
I was dragged to Busan and to a blind date.

209
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,520
I've cooperated with you more than enough, Lee Ji Han.

210
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,970
- It's your turn now. 
 - And what if I say no?

211
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,410
It can't be helped, then. I already have lots of evidence,

212
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,090
so I'll have to tattle on you for everything that happened to Do Han.

213
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,020
Tattle?

214
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,950
I don't think you can.

215
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,550
Because I'll get rid of all your evidence.

216
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,550
You said you started to like me...

217
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,890
enough to get pissed off if someone insulted me.

218
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,310
Since you like me now, can't you also just acknowledge Do Han and me?

219
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,050
Then, I think I might like you a little bit, too.

220
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,360
   

221
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,980
- Let me see your phone. 
 - What?

222
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,720
Why?

223
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,150
Your phone's fine, and you're fine as well.

224
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,780
So, what on Earth happened yesterday?

225
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,950
You know, right?

226
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,140
I always have an excuse for everything.

227
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,690
But I've got nothing to say to excuse myself today.

228
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,690
Go on.

229
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,780
I'll take the scolding.

230
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,750
I couldn't reach you at all until the district office hours ended.

231
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,220
But why'd you suddenly leave tens of missed calls,

232
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,710
only to not answer when I called you back?

233
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,250
- I'm sorry. 
 - I couldn't reach you and

234
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,450
the studio was in shambles.

235
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,150
Do you know how worried I was?

236
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,850
But what about the studio?

237
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,570
Did something happen?

238
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,910
This isn't the right place to talk about it, so let's go inside.

239
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,550
You can talk here! Just talk here.

240
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,730
He can call her if he has something to tell her.

241
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,540
Why the heck did he come in person this early in the morning?

242
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,290
- A Jeong. 
 - Yes?

243
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,560
I'm not asking you to marry me as a joke.

244
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,770
I know.

245
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,880
If I can't reach you like yesterday, that's a breach of contract—

246
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,680
 What's she doing? Why is she covering Brother's mouth? 

247
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,490
I know.

248
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,600
That's enough. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

249
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,010
So, nothing happened, right?

250
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,480
Yes.

251
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,540
I'm glad, then.

252
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,040
I think someone's going in and out of the studio.

253
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,350
- What? 
 - The plane ticket was all ripped apart.

254
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,140
We'll have to be careful for a while.

255
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,930
Hey, d-did you call the police?

256
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,350
- I don't want to complicate things. 
 - Hey, you still need to call the police about this!

257
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,900
What's your deal, seriously!

258
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,670
I just need to print a new ticket

259
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,760
and it's done once we flee to New York, too.

260
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,080
 N-New York? 

261
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,560
There's not much time left now.

262
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,840
We need to be as quiet as possible so Grandfather and Ji Han don't find out.

263
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,640
- Yes. 
 - Of all things,

264
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,510
I feared something happened to you on your way to the district office for the marriage license.

265
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,420
I was worried sick, you know.

266
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,540
What's all this about?

267
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,050
What do you mean taking off to New York?

268
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,720
And the marriage license?

269
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,540
What's with you?

270
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,990
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,730
Brother is still a bit immature.

272
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,130
I guess he's still upset about you scolding him that day.

273
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,250
It's fine. You don't need to apologize in his place.

274
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,480
I know you've been cleaning up after Min Woong whenever he caused trouble.

275
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,240
You can stop now.

276
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,770
You knew all along?

277
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,970
Then, why did you keep insisting it was Lee Do Han?

278
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,880
Grandfather, don't you want to trust me just once?

279
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,670
I can really do a good job.

280
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm different from Brother and beg to differ from Father.

281
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,660
If I've ever disappointed you in life, I'll fix it.

282
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,850
Whatever it may be. Everything.

283
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,510
I can really do a good job, Grandfather.

284
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,120
That's one thing I'm glad to hear.

285
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,290
Yes!

286
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,450
In that case, with the ambition you've just displayed,

287
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,310
help out Do Han. That kid.

288
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,130
If there's anything about you I'm disappointed about, it's only one thing.

289
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,440
That you don't acknowledge them as your brothers.

290
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,180
Because they're the only ones in my life I can't accept.

291
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,260
Also,

292
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,860
I thought you felt the same way I did all this time.

293
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,020
I'll be counting on how you said

294
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,750
you're confident about this.

295
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,710
Take your time to eat and come.

296
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,670
Hey, I'm still better than you.

297
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,630
Don't make me laugh.

298
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,100
Aren't they Director Han of Jungsang Home Shopping and CEO Yoon of Taeyang Corporation?

299
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,000
You're right.

300
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,190
- I'll have the same thing. 
 - What are they here for?

301
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,240
I didn't know you just came out when someone asked you to.

302
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,470
Why didn't you just come yesterday in person, then?

303
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,950
Instead of your cover?

304
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,370
I don't make my secretary work on the weekends.

305
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,510
But you did, starting from the early morning, Director Han.

306
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,850
Gosh! Yes, I'm sorry.

307
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,010
But I heard it early in the morning

308
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,230
that Taeyang stole our merger and acquisition case.

309
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,500
Oh, I thought you were quick, but you were actually late,

310
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,770
since you heard about what was finished on a weekday on the weekend.

311
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,090
The rumors are widespread that you're marrying Lee Do Han of LJ.

312
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,220
Are you trying to prepare the dowry?

313
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,460
Come on, Director Han.

314
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,700
I'm not at a level where I need to bring a dowry.

315
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,060
Even if it was with someone else besides the one in the widespread rumor.

316
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,870
Unless it's a gift I'm voluntarily preparing.

317
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,380
Someone else? Seo Ga Woon?

318
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,150
Who would Yoon Chae Won be interested in?

319
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,020
 When she was looking at Do Han, her eyes were glazed over. 

320
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,110
 Which of the two would she be looking at with romantic eyes? 

321
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,720
Amazing! It's hot—

322
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,390
- Executive Director Choi, are you okay? 
 - Hey, s-shut it.

323
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,750
You said you didn't know I just come out when someone asks, right?

324
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,830
You're right. I didn't come out just because you asked.

325
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,830
I was curious about you, too.

326
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,340
Who was it?

327
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,950
The woman Ji Han set you up on a blind date with yesterday in my place.

328
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,560
 Honey! 

329
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,200
 Honey! 

330
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,890
Honey! Honey!

331
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,660
This is bad.

332
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,950
Oh, my.

333
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,840
W-What's wrong with your pants?

334
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,740
Did you pee yourself while you were out or something?

335
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,820
It looks like what you said was right.

336
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,150
I think Yoon Chae Won likes Lee Ji Han, that bastard, not Lee Do Han!

337
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,680
 Na A Jeong? 

338
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,020
 I heard she works as an extra. 

339
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,570
 Didn't Lee Ji Han tell you? 

340
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,660
Na A Jeong.

341
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,100
Oh, my gosh! That was Na A Jeong?

342
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,670
- Yes! 
 - Whoa.

343
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,790
Ji Han is really something else.

344
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,090
How could he send his sister-in-law-to-be out on a blind date?

345
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,340
Isn't he crazy?

346
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,380
So? So what? Hurry up and tell me.

347
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,120
Honey, this isn't the time to be excited like this. Okay?

348
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,370
That ambitious bastard is trying to get rid of Na A Jeong

349
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,230
and connect Yoon Chae Won with his brother.

350
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,870
He doesn't seem to know Yoon Chae Won likes him yet.

351
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,500
Once he finds out, he'll willingly jump into the lake called Taeyang as an offering

352
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,110
and if they end up together, we'll be...

353
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,330
We'll really be doomed.

354
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,390
You're right.

355
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,330
But Ji Han has a woman.

356
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,470
You said your employee saw them together at the LJ Hotel in Busan.

357
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,430
What do you mean by Lee Ji Han having a woman?

358
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,570
What brings you here, Miss?

359
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,180
Weren't you scheming something else?

360
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,390
What did you mean? And what was that about the blind date?

361
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,030
Answer me first, Sis.

362
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,240
This is my house, and my words come first in my house.

363
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,250
If you don't like that, you can go elsewhere and find out.

364
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:51,090
Honey, shall we continue talking inside the room and lock the door so no one can hear?

365
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,430
What is it?

366
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,530
Knock before you come in.

367
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,660
Yes. Okay.

368
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,530
Do you know what the most infuriating crime in the world is?

369
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,810
Getting caught.

370
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,620
What are you so proud of that you leave me behind?

371
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,020
Are you the only one mad?

372
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,110
Am I the only one caught?

373
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,200
What about you? Why are you coming out of A Jeong's house?

374
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,110
Your crime is way worse than mine.

375
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,140
Forget that and spill it.

376
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,850
Everything I heard back there. What was that about?

377
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,380
Do you know why I'm trying to marry A Jeong?

378
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,470
Because I don't want to give excuses.

379
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,570
I don't want to give excuses to anyone anymore about anything.

380
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,000
He caught it.

381
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,510
He caught that woman's shamelessness.

382
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,400
Fine, I'll tell you everything since you caught me.

383
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,900
- I'll leave with A Jeong. 
 - You can't.

384
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,610
We'll sign the marriage papers before that, so things are final.

385
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,280
Who said you can?

386
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,140
I don't need your permission because we already agreed to this.

387
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,660
What about the company, then?

388
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,690
- What about me? 
 - Why do you ask me that every time?

389
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,340
I'm not your father. We're only brothers, and I just happened to be born a few years before you.

390
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,440
My life's already full of unknowns. Do I have to know about the company and your life?

391
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,720
Hey, Lee Do Han.

392
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,270
You know what?

393
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,400
It's suffocating whenever you rely on me and expect something from me like this?

394
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,550
I'm trying to breathe for once, and A Jeong's the one who lets me do that.

395
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,660
What right do you have to oppose her?

396
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,300
Don't I even have this much right?

397
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,620
I'm your younger brother.

398
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,460
I won't ask anymore, either.

399
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,410
About why on Earth you were at her place

400
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,560
and what you did with A Jeong.

401
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,610
But this is my final warning, Lee Ji Han.

402
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,180
Don't mess with A Jeong ever again.

403
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,450
What if I do?

404
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,570
What are you going to do?

405
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,370
I'll quit being your brother.

406
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,060
- What? 
 - You hate your brother who doesn't listen to you and

407
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,950
I hate my brother, who doesn't respect my decision.

408
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,340
Is there any other way?

409
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,610
You'll quit being my brother?

410
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,450
You won't quit being that woman's husband

411
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,050
but being my brother?

412
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,700
Correct.

413
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,900
Why are you flipping out when even Grandfather gave permission?

414
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,580
You're crossing the line right now, Lee Ji Han. Are you aware?

415
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,040
Gosh, it looks delicious.

416
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,900
Let's eat.

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,210
I'm sure you already know since you must've heard.

418
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,800
But I thought it'd be right to apologize in person, and that's why I wanted to see you.

419
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,930
I was pushing so hard to make you my granddaughter-in-law,

420
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,040
but I just allowed him to marry someone else.

421
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,450
I'm ashamed to face you.

422
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,330
I'm fully aware of why you're telling me this.

423
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,880
You're asking me to help Do Han, though it may not be through marriage. Am I right?

424
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,650
I'm even more thankful for your understanding.

425
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,460
I also know you looked favorably upon me.

426
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,410
And honestly, I think you feel a tiny bit disappointed as well.

427
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,800
No. I'm hugely disappointed.

428
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,170
But what can I do?

429
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,290
It's not like I can force him not to marry her.

430
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,300
That's why I'd like to make a suggestion.

431
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,600
- Sure. 
 - Please give me Ji Han.

432
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,900
What do I need to do to him

433
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,250
to make them all fall like dominos?

434
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,390
According to No. 3 of Article 840 of the Civil Code,

435
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,350
when you're unfairly treated by your spouse or his direct relatives,

436
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,520
the court will deem it a reasonable cause for divorce.

437
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,090
There's nothing much to unfair treatment.

438
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,180
Verbal abuse, physical abuse, excessive tampering, consistent harassment...

439
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,280
They're all things that bratty brother-in-law-to-be is doing to you.

440
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,810
By the way, how do you know so much about that?

441
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,440
I was on "Love and War" briefly a long time ago.

442
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,590
Anyway, I'd also be infuriated if I were him.

443
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,610
If my sister comes out of my fiancé...

444
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,780
And if you found out your brother was going to sign the marriage papers and run away,

445
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,740
you'd be pissed, too. Right?

446
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,590
A Jeong, whose side are you on?

447
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,350
Is it your fiancé or your brother-in-law-to-be?

448
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,380
Sis, taking sides is childish.

449
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm just worried those two brothers will grow apart because of me.

450
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,580
Come on. It's not your fault that they're at each other's throats.

451
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,740
She's right. Just ignore it.

452
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,550
Spending money is obvious, but being this thoughtful* is not obvious. 
  (Korean word "Spending" is used here) 

453
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,430
Right.

454
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,060
No matter how much he maliciously comments about your marriage,

455
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,570
what can he do if you just ignore him?

456
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,220
No one ever wrote an article about me.

457
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,640
How come I get malicious comments first?

458
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,240
And why do I feel so uncomfortable when I think about that malicious commenter?

459
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,540
What about changing that malicious commenter into a good one?

460
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,460
- A good one? 
 - Just as I said.

461
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,420
Make that malicious commenter, your brother-in-law-to-be, like you.

462
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,710
You said he told you he likes you a bit more, though it was drunk talk.

463
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,090
Jong Hee, I told you all the time.

464
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,070
Don't take the nonsense uttered by drunk people seriously.

465
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,210
To be frank, even if it was nonsense,

466
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,810
dig in if he showed an opening.

467
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,570
That's your specialty, Sis.

468
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:16,430
Weren't you the only one who got everything you wanted out of the bratty FD at the filming set?

469
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,090
You said he thinks dearly of his brother.

470
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,160
Once you get on his good side, wouldn't he only write good comments about your marriage?

471
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,180
 You know what? 

472
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,490
 It's suffocating whenever you rely on me and expect something from me like this? 

473
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,770
 I'm trying to breathe for once, and A Jeong's the one who lets me do that. 

474
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,550
Ji Han, you have the file on the Myeongju shopping mall we shared at the last meeting, right?

475
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,140
Team Leader Eun's looking for it.

476
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,790
Okay.

477
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,500
He's already sighed 24 times today alone.

478
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,720
Considering the watery coffee incident and the endless copy incident,

479
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,010
don't you think something's happened to Ji Han?

480
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,380
Just stand still!

481
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,310
Did you get tied up and kidnapped or locked up?

482
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,500
You didn't? Did you hurt your head or something? Huh?

483
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,860
That's not it.

484
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,790
Did you fall, hit a bad spot, and pass out, huh?

485
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,110
That would've been better for me, actually.

486
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,960
Getting hurt on the outside would be less painful than getting my feelings hurt.

487
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,280
If it's none of the above, why couldn't I reach you all weekend?

488
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,870
This is all your fault, Eun Taek!

489
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,840
It's because of your unnecessary words that haunt my ears, Eun Taek.

490
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,750
Which one of the things I said are you talking about?

491
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,600
In the first place,

492
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,540
I was wrong to waste my time trying to seduce Na A Jeong.

493
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,560
While I was wasting my time,

494
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,360
Brother was planning to run away to New York with her,

495
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,980
after signing the marriage papers.

496
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,200
Your brother can't flee to New York. Signing the marriage papers is even worse.

497
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,740
You think I'm sitting here because I don't know that?

498
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,180
No, that's not it.

499
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,520
I think the Myeongju shopping mall complex project will resume soon.

500
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,090
What?

501
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,800
- What will resume? 
 - According to Secretary Kim,

502
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,850
Chairman even had dinner with CEO Yoon alone a few days ago.

503
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,470
 It looks like CEO Yoon made a move since your brother is pretty set on his decision. 

504
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,820
 But if your brother gets married and runs away in this situation... 

505
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,480
Myeongju shopping mall complex will go down the drain,

506
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,980
along with CEO Yoon and Lee Do Han.

507
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,680
There are a few CCTVs around here for commercial and safety purposes.

508
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,930
But we can't view them because of Personal Information Protection Act.

509
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,470
I reckon it'll be better to call the police.

510
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,170
Then, we can view them ourselves.

511
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,000
No, it's okay.

512
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,800
I installed the security device, so it should be fine now.

513
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,810
Wait, but this can lead to a larger problem later.

514
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,960
Instead of that, could I ask you for a personal favor, Secretary Kim?

515
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,040
A favor?

516
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,460
I picked out about five auspicious days that are around the time period you told me.

517
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,420
Yes.

518
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,180
The best time is the Hour of the Horse of each day. 
  (11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.) 

519
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,380
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

520
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,980
- Well done, sir. 
 - Yes.

521
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,430
- Pick one out from among these. 
 - Yes.

522
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,640
I'll report the list of guests you mentioned once the Secretary Team finishes it.

523
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,340
- Yes. 
 - And I have something to tell you, Chairman.

524
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,310
What is it?

525
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,820
Though we'll try to stop the press until the end,

526
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,780
but we've finished the press release on Na A Jeong in case of an unforeseen situation.

527
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,610
But it looks like Do Han wants to change the content of the press release entirely.

528
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,670
Entirely? Why?

529
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,300
What's there to change?

530
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,020
You just wrote about that lady factually as is.

531
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,060
Yes, I wrote them as they are.

532
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,320
But why?

533
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,570
It seems he doesn't like that.

534
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,360
If Na A Jeong's information needs to be exposed inevitably,

535
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,620
he wants her to be portrayed as an entirely different person.

536
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,260
 So that people can't easily figure out Na A Jeong's identity. 

537
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,790
 So that we can prevent people from badmouthing her as much as possible. 

538
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:02,390
 He seems to be gravely worried about media exposure since Na A Jeong is an ordinary person. 

539
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,920
Hey, long time no see.

540
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,040
It's the same old for me.

541
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,010
Hey, you know...

542
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,270
Do you still keep in touch with Dae Hyeon?

543
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,970
Please excuse me, I'm going in with you.

544
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,600
He's got all sorts of things going on.

545
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,420
Isn't LJ going to go bankrupt at this rate?

546
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,790
    
 They chose someone like him as their model employee.

547
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,470
I'll only get married quietly.

548
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,600
    
 So please just be a model brother-in-law.

549
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,380
What brings you here?

550
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,980
Oh, hello. Doesn't Lee Ji Han work here?

551
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,430
Ji Han's working offsite at the department store at the moment.

552
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,010
Oh, I see.

553
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,100
Then, I should be able to meet him if I go there. Right?

554
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,870
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

555
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,160
- Is she his lover? 
 - Gosh, no way.

556
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,480
She doesn't suit Ji Han at all.

557
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,940
Gosh, why did Lee Ji Han leave his clothes at my house?

558
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,730
It's such a hassle and a bother.

559
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,280
She definitely is. If he's leaving his clothes behind, it's case closed.

560
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,980
That's crazy...

561
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,840
You feel extremely bad toward me, huh?

562
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,220
What's with this silence?

563
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,760
Don't laugh.

564
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,520
I'm already sorry, and I feel even worse if you sound so good-natured.

565
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,320
What are you sorry about?

566
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,110
For leaving during dinner?

567
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,840
Or standing me up in front of the hotel?

568
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,460
No. Not being any help to you.

569
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,150
I heard you're helping with resuming the Myeongju shopping mall complex project.

570
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,130
I didn't know you were doing the work in person.

571
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,390
I was wasting my time elsewhere and...

572
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,020
Her name's Na A Jeong, right?

573
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,160
The woman who went out to my blind date in my place.

574
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,550
- You heard? 
 - I saw you two together in front of the hotel by chance.

575
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,480
What's going on?

576
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,200
Didn't you say you two don't get along?

577
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,000
You looked quite friendly.

578
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,400
We looked friendly? That woman and me?

579
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,410
Yes, it honestly made me jealous.

580
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,850
I thought Lee Ji Han only laughed with me.

581
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,000
I didn't know you'd laugh with Na A Jeong, too.

582
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,970
I laughed? With that woman?

583
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,540
Yes!

584
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,730
So, I even did a background check on Na A Jeong.

585
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,500
I became very curious. It made me look pathetic.

586
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,200
No need to get jealous or be curious.

587
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,560
You don't need to look pathetic just because of that woman.

588
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,390
What kind of a woman is she?

589
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,240
Not sure.

590
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,710
She's a shameless and forceful woman who blackmails habitually.

591
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,840
 Blackmailing is your specialty. What I'm doing right now is negotiating. 

592
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,230
Even if she's insulted,

593
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,530
she'll let it slide if you buy her food and drinks. She has no pride.

594
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,670
 I don't care what strangers say about me. 

595
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,620
 I was treated to good food and expensive drinks. 

596
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,800
 I didn't lose out. But that's not the case for you, Lee Ji Han. 

597
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,890
 By chance... 

598
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,100
 are you getting mad in my place? 

599
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,370
But she becomes prideful for useless things.

600
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,850
She's so inconsistent.

601
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,120
 Who the hell are you to make me have nasty regrets? 

602
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,320
 The reason you're so screwed up 

603
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,410
 is because you made me hate myself, not you. 

604
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,110
 You know that? 

605
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Anyway, there's not one good thing about that woman.

606
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,660
 I think I like you enough to get pissed off... 

607
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,240
I hate that woman enough to do the happy dance...

608
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
 if someone insulted you. 

609
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,000
 You, Na A Jeong. 

610
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,540
...if someone insulted her.

611
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,910
So, never mind that woman and just go straight forward, CEO Yoon.

612
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,810
And be sure to accomplish what you desire.

613
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,610
Why don't you add one more?

614
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,310
The woman you won't ever be talking to again after this moment.

615
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,960
What's this?

616
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,510
Are you a stalker?

617
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,680
Why did you come all the way here and eavesdrop on me?

618
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,030
Why? Are you silently blackmailing me to accept you two, or

619
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,480
are you protesting because your ego got bruised?

620
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,930
I guess I must be a villain to you, Lee Ji Han.

621
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,830
You take a blessed event as blackmail and say I'm protesting when you should apologize.

622
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,890
Thank you, though.

623
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,290
I was confused for a moment because of my role.

624
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,500
But I just got the idea.

625
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,540
If I'm going to be treated like a villain anyway,

626
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,970
I'll do it right.

627
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,360
I can't be nice to someone who won't be understanding.

628
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,100
Just what I hoped for. If that will be your true color, Na A Jeong,

629
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,400
just be honest and stop confusing people.

630
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,220
What were you confused about?

631
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,640
You've never derailed from your path.

632
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,120
You consistently hated and resented me.

633
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,010
Keep going the way you were going.

634
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,390
That makes it easier for me to be your villain.

635
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,970
Hey!

636
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,790
There's not one good thing about me?

637
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,480
Great! I've no interest in getting on your good side, either.

638
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,990
And how old are you?

639
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,250
I can tell you're young at a glance.

640
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,110
How dare you skip honorifics whenever you please?

641
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,480
Don't push your luck, okay?

642
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,540
You would've been dead today if you weren't Do Han's brother.

643
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,860
What can you do, huh? What can you even do?

644
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,880
You think I'd be scared of you?

645
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
And you're not the only one going easy on me!

646
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,310
I'm going easy on you, too! I'm being patient with you.

647
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,880
What's wrong, Terry?

648
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,370
Aren't you hungry?

649
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,410
Do you want to go for a walk?

650
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,020
What the heck? Are you asking for food or a walk?

651
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,770
Barking won't do you any good.

652
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,550
I'll choose my lane for sure and keep going down that way.

653
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,620
So, make yourself clear, too.

654
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,810
Is it food or a walk?

655
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,440
Do I look like a villain to you, too?

656
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,860
My brother's on Na A Jeong's side and

657
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,380
my dog's on Na A Jeong's side, too.

658
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,600
It must be great to be Na A Jeong.

659
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,850
   

660
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:36,980
So, why did you want to see me, Managing Director Choi Seung Ah?

661
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,940
I want you to investigate the woman my younger brother is dating.

662
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,770
You've got two younger brothers.

663
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,570
Which one? Is it Lee Do Han or Lee Ji Han?

664
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,240
Lee Do Han.

665
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,900
However, I think that woman also has something going on with Lee Ji Han.

666
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,130
The previous article you wrote was incorrect.

667
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:05,580
The woman who will be marrying Lee Do Han isn't Yoon Chae Won of Taeyang Corporation.

668
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,660
She's the one.

669
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,150
Her name's Na A Jeong.

670
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,800
Reporter Kang, can you lump that woman with

671
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,780
my two younger brothers in a nice fashion?

672
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:25,330
I think it'll be a great gift to both of us if you can do a good job.

673
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,590
 Recently, the sale price of reconstructed apartments in Gangyeon District, Seoul, 

674
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,440
 has been approaching an all-time high. 

675
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,040
 After being designated as a land transaction permit zone, transactions have stagnated. 

676
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,750
 The prices are recovering as transactions have been gradually revived 

677
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,320
 at the end of last year due to deregulation of ultra-high-priced apartments 

678
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,280
 and land transportation for reconstruction safety diagnosis this year. 

679
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,610
 According to the actual transaction price provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport 

680
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,910
 last week, the exclusive 155 square meter sentence was sold for 2.5 billion won last month. 

681
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,600
Hello?

682
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh, yes. How are you?

683
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,560
Could you tell me when it'll be?

684
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,070
I'm really thankful for your consideration, but

685
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,550
I already have something that day.

686
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,350
I know it's a great opportunity.

687
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,840
Yes.

688
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,530
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,760
Yes, I'm sorry.

690
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,030
What are you so sorry about?

691
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,350
It's an audition offer this weekend.

692
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,790
Hey, Na A Jeong!

693
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,120
Did you just reject an audition?

694
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,580
She went to an audition three hours after an appendectomy before.

695
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:44,170
But you're becoming a conglomerate's youngest madam now, huh?

696
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,840
Golly, Madam.

697
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,820
Is that really it?

698
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,440
Otherwise... Wait! Did they tell you to stop acting?

699
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,870
It's not like that!

700
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,050
I can't do that day.

701
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,580
I need to go act somewhere else.

702
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,120
I mean, she has been waiting for the weekends...

703
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,430
It's the in-laws, just in time.

704
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,650
 Executive Director Choi Min Woong of LJ Hotel and Managing Director Choi Seung Ah of LJ Department Store 

705
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,680
 each participated in community service volunteer activities today. 

706
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,110
   
 - Hello, enjoy. 
 - Hello. 

707
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,360
 As the memorial day for the late President Hyeon Soo Hyeon approaches, 

708
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,200
 it seems he decided to take this step instead of the memorial service for his mother. 

709
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,430
    
  Here is Reporter Song In Ae. 

710
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,670
- Did you wait long? 
 - No.

711
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,450
That's good. Let's go.

712
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,630
You can still tell me if you'll be uncomfortable.

713
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,230
Not at all. I don't feel uncomfortable.

714
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,850
I wanted to go greet Mother if I had the chance, too.

715
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,790
Let's go.

716
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,750
We can visit Mom next time quietly, just the two of us.

717
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,730
It's fine.

718
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,530
Are you being dragged to die?

719
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,210
Quit the drama and get in.

720
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,340
It's fine.

721
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,210
Why?

722
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,780
Is this a warning, too?

723
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,440
Wow, I'm too scared to say anything now.

724
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,980
Brother, don't you think this is wrong?

725
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,680
Isn't it way too early for this lady to attend our family event?

726
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,610
She didn't even marry you yet.

727
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:43,390
Do Han, why does your brother act out whenever he gets a chance?

728
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,430
It's such a turnoff.

729
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,590
Brother, did I ever get turned on by her?

730
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,370
I don't think so, but she's already worried about being turned off.

731
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,350
- Lee Ji Han. 
 - What?

732
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,760
Are you warning me again?

733
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,380
She's the one who crossed the line, but it's me again. Right?

734
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,620
It's not like I can fire the referee.

735
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:04,120
Will the game even go properly when the judgment is so unfair?

736
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,290
Stop it.

737
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,240
No, don't stop him.

738
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,100
Just let him continue all he wants.

739
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,950
It's better to be trashed to my face

740
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,580
than to be trashed behind my back by a petty coward.

741
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,680
What— Petty? A coward?

742
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,380
Do Han, what was the most insulting thing you heard in your life?

743
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,270
A Jeong...

744
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:25,610
It was hearing he hated me enough to do the happy dance when someone insulted me.

745
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,860
Look who's inconsistent here.

746
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,600
I thought he said he liked me enough to get pissed off if someone insulted me.

747
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,210
Let's just go quietly.

748
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,520
I don't want to be stressed even on the way to see Mother.

749
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:48,290
Gosh, I can't tell if you're in the process of fighting or getting closer.

750
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:02,550
   

751
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,440
Grandfather.

752
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,440
You came right on time.

753
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,380
Chae Won, what brings you here?

754
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,810
I invited her. She's my guest.

755
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,380
What are you all doing? Aren't you going inside?

756
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,500
   

757
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,830
   

758
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:55,110
A Jeong, one moment.

759
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,090
Say hello.

760
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,910
She'll be your daughter-in-law.

761
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,710
I allowed her in your place because she

762
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,450
seems to like Do Han a lot.

763
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,400
Let her greet you now.

764
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,830
Go ahead.

765
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,680
It looks like a reporter had visited.

766
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,190
He was curious about the truth of the only daughter of a conglomeratefamily who suddenly disappeared without a trace.

767
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,290
Mr. Ji Han probably knew nothing

768
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,650
 about what kind of a person his mother used to be. 

769
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,260
 Hello, kid. 

770
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,670
 Who are you? 

771
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,070
 Your mother's name is Hyeon Soo Hyeon, right? 

772
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,450
 Do you know my mom? 

773
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,510
 Of course. I'm your mom's friend. 

774
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,300
 It's pouring. Let's go home. 

775
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,260
What would an eight-year-old kid even know?

776
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,180
He said he was his mother's friend

777
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,860
and that he'll take him home.

778
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,830
He was excited and said yes.

779
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,330
It rained a lot that day.

780
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,610
He was trying to lose the reporter and ended up in an accident.

781
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,260
 - Soo Hyeon! Soo Hyeon!  
 - Chairman said he still doesn't understand

782
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,510
why he had decided to do that.

783
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,400
 Soo Hyeon! Soo Hyeon! 

784
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,270
 - Soo Hyeon...  
 - One thing that's for sure is

785
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,880
he still regrets that decision to this day.

786
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,710
I'm sure it was the same for Grandfather but it was too cruel of an accident for Lee Ji Han.

787
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:09,860
That's why Mr. Ji Han still hates rainy days the most.

788
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,290
I guess he's reminded of that day.

789
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,830
Why's she looking at me with such wet eyes? It'll make fungi grow on me.

790
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,450
- Grandfather. 
 - Yes.

791
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,510
- Did you hear the news? 
 - What?

792
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:51,070
CEO Yoon is helping out with resuming the Myeongju shopping mall complex project.

793
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,390
Thinking about it, the greatest power of all powers is competence.

794
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,490
Not violence.

795
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,550
Ji Han, thank you, but you don't have to talk business here.

796
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,960
It's fine. I did hear that.

797
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,980
I didn't know you'd keep your promise with me this quickly.

798
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,830
Thank you.

799
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,920
Promise? You made a promise to Grandfather?

800
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,960
What is it?

801
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,020
All right, it's my turn to give you what I promised.

802
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,830
That's why I asked you to come with me today.

803
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,660
She must've asked for something big if the Myeongju City project was at stake.

804
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,240
CEO Yoon, whatever that was, you'll be able to have it in no time.

805
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,930
Because my grandfather always keeps his promises.

806
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,580
Grandfather,

807
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,900
would you like to watch a video?

808
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,280
- A video? 
 - Yes.

809
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,040
I actually recorded you and Do Han walking over here from behind you earlier without even knowing.

810
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,020
Oh, really?

811
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:03,830
I just have a habit of recording moments I don't want to forget.

812
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,640
It's nice.

813
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,450
This is the last picture.

814
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:13,930
You can swipe left and look at them in reverse order.

815
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,390
- Send me a copy of this one. 
- Yes.

816
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,910
You had a talent like this, huh?

817
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,600
Chairman.

818
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,480
I have the car ready.

819
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,110
Okay, let's go.

820
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,800
Can you show me again next time you record something interesting?

821
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,010
Of course, I have more interesting stuff on my phone besides this video.

822
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,640
Let's go.

823
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,220
I told you it's over if you show that video to others, right?

824
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,060
Shut your mouth, or I might send it out to everyone now.

825
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,360
Ji Han.

826
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:02,480
You should come with me in my car with Chae Won.

827
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,110
- Me? 
 - Why? You don't want to?

828
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,000
No, that's not the case, but—

829
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,480
I thought about this and

830
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,700
I realized I never got to spend time alone with Ji Han.

831
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:18,220
Let's go back together and have dinner, and I have something to tell you, too.

832
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,840
You're okay with it, right, Chae Won?

833
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,060
- Yes. 
 - And you? You don't want to?

834
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,910
I'd love to have dinner.

835
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,680
That settles it, then. Let's go.

836
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:36,670
As I expected, this is your car, right, Chairman?

837
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,070
You came to remember her with your grandchildren.

838
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,720
How nice you all look.

839
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,880
CEO Yoon Chae Won is here, too, huh?

840
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,000
Did you like the picture I took last time?

841
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,040
That's enough.

842
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,930
What business do you have here?

843
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,380
While I was at it, you know.

844
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,220
It's Hyeon Soo Hyeon's memorial day, so I'll wish her peace.

845
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,910
And find material for my articles if I happen to run into you.

846
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,620
Everyone's dying to write about your third grandson,

847
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,560
but we know nothing, and it's driving us nuts.

848
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,360
Oh, yes, t-this right here.

849
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,770
Is it because of my age?

850
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:15,360
It aches here every time it rains, so I can't even investigate like I used to.

851
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,510
Oh, that's right. Isn't it the same for you?

852
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,350
After you got injured back then.

853
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,100
How dare you show up here and act out?

854
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,850
- How dare you show up here! 
 - Sir.

855
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,810
- You— 
 - G-Grandfather—

856
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,270
Let go, you brat!

857
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,910
It's not like I can't come here when I'm also a victim of the incident.

858
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,680
So you should answer your phone!

859
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,620
I can't help but come to where you are if you keep avoiding me!

860
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,820
By the way, who is she?

861
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,880
Ji Han, take care of A Jeong for me.

862
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,540
I'm fine, so stop looking and focus on driving.

863
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,250
You're not okay, huh?

864
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,720
People who aren't okay always say they are.

865
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,520
What are you doing? Slow down.

866
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,610
Don't you see the car tailing us?

867
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,060
We'll get caught if I slow down.

868
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,950
But this isn't the right way. Where are you going right now?

869
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,790
I'm the driver. I'll figure it out.

870
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:14,330
- You just hold tight on the handle. 
  - Recalculating the route. 

871
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,980
Na A Jeong!

872
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,890
Na A Jeong, stop!

873
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,460
Stop, please!

874
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,610
Oh, yes. This is Reporter Kang Ik Joon. Yes.

875
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:02,600
The offer you made last time. I'll accept it.

876
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,620
I was only going to test it out, but it's more interesting than I thought.

877
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:12,370
Those brothers and the lady named Na A Jeong.

878
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,340
Gosh, what?

879
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:30,020
We were able to lose that reporter, thanks to me.

880
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,250
Otherwise, my guess is we would've gone for round two.

881
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,030
I would've had round two with you.

882
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:40,420
Do you know how many times I banged my head?

883
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,830
It's fine now, right?

884
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,200
What was that just now?

885
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,500
What do you think? I was pampering you.

886
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,480
So why?

887
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,560
Any other day, you would've beat me up to a pulp with that mouth of yours.

888
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,350
Lee Ji Han, you were hurt earlier.

889
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,430
Because Grandfather did this.

890
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:25,640
I don't want to get mad at you to add to that and trample on your feelings.

891
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:32,460
I don't wish to console you about something I don't even know about.

892
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,940
I don't want to be nosy and get involved thoughtlessly, either.

893
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,400
But I think I can hear you out like this.

894
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,150
Your complaints and whining, Lee Ji Han. Stuff like that.

895
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,920
So you can tell me everything.

896
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,310
I'll hear you out and forget it all.

897
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:57,800
Did I ever tell you I'm good at things like that?

898
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,600
Is your stomach feeling all right?

899
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,460
Should I ask for another cup of water or something?

900
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,230
I don't need water.

901
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,360
Let's go outside for some air.

902
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,390
Why did you come to the department store that day?

903
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,580
I'm sure you didn't come by to eavesdrop on me badmouthing you.

904
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,670
How surprising.

905
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:08,620
You know that, yet you still haven't apologized.

906
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,460
I went there to try to get on your good side.

907
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,120
Someone told me this.

908
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,000
Since you think dearly of your brother,

909
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,330
you'd be optimistic about this marriage once I get on your good side.

910
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,900
You seem to enjoy looking up at trees you can't even climb, Na A Jeong.

911
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,870
I said this before, but I really think you're shrewd.

912
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,930
I'm sorry for not telling you

913
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:41,790
about New York and the marriage papers.

914
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:50,230
As you said, I might not be the perfect partner for Do Han.

915
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:56,060
But he wouldn't be suffering while living a life he doesn't want if he's with me, right?

916
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:01,040
If it's a marriage I must go through in the end, I only want blessings.

917
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,330
I don't even wish to get on your good side.

918
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,950
Can't you just watch us?

919
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,500
I'll be really good to Do Han.

920
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,050
How is he doing?

921
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,360
He fell asleep just now.

922
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,580
Don't come out. I'll go on my own.

923
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,870
It's related to Ji Han, right?

924
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:28,520
The promise you and Grandfather made.

925
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,630
Hey, let me ask you the question I asked you before again.

926
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:39,980
Yoon Chae Won, do you like Ji Han?

927
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,650
What Grandfather promised to give you. Is it Lee Ji Han?

928
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,400
You really—

929
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,740
Did you make a deal with my grandfather over my brother?

930
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,460
Yes, I did.

931
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,620
Why? Am I not allowed to?

932
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,380
Of course not!

933
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,300
Ji Han doesn't know about it.

934
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,060
You should decide that after asking him, at least.

935
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:05,290
Do Han, you know you're being absurd as you say that. Right?

936
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:10,330
Deciding things without asking Ji Han's opinion is what you do best.

937
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,630
Don't worry. I'll take my time and tell him.

938
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:17,660
Because I don't want Ji Han to get hurt, either.

939
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,080
He's precious to me, too.

940
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,400
What if Ji Han says no?

941
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,300
You said I was Ji Han's first love.

942
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,910
You also know Ji Han's ideal type has been me since he was a kid.

943
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:33,700
Such feelings wouldn't suddenly disappear or turn for someone else, would they?

944
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,540
I'm leaving.

945
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,740
Where are we going right now?

946
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,170
   

947
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,500
I'm sorry for lying.

948
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,600
Though I'm a fake daughter-in-law,

949
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,130
I'll take good care of your son.

950
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,790
So please don't be too worried there.

951
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:35,570
You've gone mad, Lee Ji Han.

952
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,390
You've finally gone mad.

953
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,590
I thought you didn't like the rain.

954
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:08,410
♫  I fly with you  ♫ ♫

955
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,760
♫  Azure feelings come blowing  ♫ ♫

956
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,740
♫  What do we do?  ♫

957
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,420
♫  A night filled with dreams  ♫

958
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,040
♫  Only you and I  ♫

959
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,440
♫  In all the days and scenes containing you  ♫

960
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,980
♫  Butterflies are flying around  ♫

961
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,900
♫  Butterflies are you and I, yeah  ♫

962
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,510
   

963
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:37,020
   

964
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,010
 Hey, Han Young Hoon. 

965
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:55,610
 You punk, you better apologize. 

966
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:59,340
 What's wrong with my mom? 

967
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,870
 Apologize... 

968
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,390
 to Na A Jeong. 

969
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:04,970
