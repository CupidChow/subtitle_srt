1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,770
   
   

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,820
   
   

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,110
   

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,330
   

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,760
     

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,070
   

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,010
   

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,270
   

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,940
   

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:43,950


11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,910
   

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,220
   

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,340
Yes, that's good.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,970
Congratulations.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,760
This is already your third time being a model employee. Right?

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,260
Yes, I'm grateful they think well of me every time.

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,060
But how did you hurt your nose?

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,950
I should know to hold back when I see injustice,

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,710
but I always get involved and get bloodied like this.

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,620
That's so cool. You live a model life even outside of work, I see!

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,210
 If you think about it, it's not only actors on screen who act. 

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,200
 LJ, LJ, LJ! 

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,980
 There are moments when even ordinary people have to act. 

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,760
 One difference is that there are no NGs in real life. 

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,810
 What do you think? 

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,710
 It's sticking your nose where you don't belong. 

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,160
I got too nosy...

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,920
 Hey, Do Han. I'll do it. 

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,030
 Getting married. 

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,230
...and ended up bringing them together.

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,790
 So, we lack the ability to undo our stupid mistakes, 

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,080
 We're eating mundane food like this 

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,060
 at the Han River, which is nothing out of the ordinary. 

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,600
 But isn't it really nice? 

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,060
 ...the ability to jog our memories, 

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,240
It tastes different from that day.

37
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,190
   

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,840
 ...and the ability to go back and fix the wounds that have healed incorrectly. 

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,780
   

40
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,640
 But maybe this place might have that ability? 

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,550
It's not good.

42
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,040
Could you spray this once for me?

43
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,190
Let's see...

44
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,620
This isn't good, either. Right?

45
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,000
For the last time,

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,420
could you just shake this once for me?

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,910
Gosh, I give up! This is driving me nuts.

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,590
What? Why don't you tell me to do a sword dance and walk on knives?

49
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,270
How about you just write me a paper talisman?

50
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,740
Do you have a talisman that has the ability to cancel what I've said?

51
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,240
Just get married.

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,350
According to Dongjanim, you'll receive lots of love from your husband. 
  (A boy ghost) 

53
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,130
That Dongjanim told me I would surely become successful last year.

54
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,660
And early this year, you said you see me getting international awards.

55
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,200
This time, it's for sure.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,830
You have good children fortune.

57
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,740
You will have at least two.

58
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,800
Buddhist saint, if you keep telling me wrong predictions,

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,790
I'll look up your channel.

60
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,050
I'll go to that channel and find the video with the most views

61
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,100
and I'll post mean comments saying how you're wrong all the time.

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
Just not on the BTS's New Year's fortune.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,520
Well, should I ask Dongjanim one more time?

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,130
Okay.

65
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,880
Let's see.

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,560
All right.

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,360
All right, let's see, let's see, let's see.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,230
I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it!

69
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,270
I see it!

70
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,740
A rose.

71
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,030
It has a lot of thorns,

72
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,340
and it's waiting for a butterfly.

73
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,300
But it's a situation where it meets a bee instead and gets all of its nectar sucked up.

74
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,070
Right?

75
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,390
You're saying if we get married, I'll be taken advantage of and thrown out.

76
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,960
I knew it.

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,350
What are you saying?

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,240
It's him who will be taken advantage of.

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,340
Pardon?

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,720
You are the bee.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,050
And a really nasty bee at that.

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,730
But something's strange.

83
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,770
Why is the rose lying down like this?

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,010
What are you doing here?

85
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,880
Stand there and make your choice.

86
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,130
Is it me or that woman?

87
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,220
Geez, how old are you?

88
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,350
Are you throwing your weight around because you're older? When you're supposedly worldly?

89
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,030
You said on the day of the banquet

90
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,140
that you have at least one thing you want to hide.

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,830
By chance, does Na A Jeong know about it?

92
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm right. That's why you're trying to marry her, right?

93
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,950
What is it? Is she holding something over your head?

94
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,640
It's not like that.

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,840
Then, why are you avoiding my eyes?

96
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,690
If you have nothing to do, go and walk Terry.

97
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,800
Why are you avoiding this conversation?

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,260
 My daughter is here! 

99
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,710
♫  Congratulations, congratulations!  ♫

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,360
♫  Congratulations on passing your audition!  ♫

101
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,980
Honey! Honey, look at A Jeong's face. She definitely fell for it, right?

102
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,360
Not sure. She isn't like you, Honey, and is good at acting.

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,480
She could just be pretending to fall for it.

104
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,030
A Jeong, you have to get me the autographs from the famous actors in that drama.

105
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,680
Gosh, Honey, seriously! Sis might become the most famous one now.

106
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,910
What are you saying?

107
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,800
Auntie, what are you doing? The candle wax is getting all over the cake.

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,550
- Blow it out quickly. 
 - Yeah, that's right.

109
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,610
Congratulations!

110
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,880
- Hey, are you crying? 
 - Congratulations!

111
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,440
Goodness, Sis is really crying.

112
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,110
I told you! Sis likes this kind of stuff more than you think.

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,620
Thanks, everyone.

114
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,930
You're the best.

115
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,690
- You've been through a lot, my daughter. 
 - She's touched.

116
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,490
   

117
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,800
   

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,820
   

119
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,910
   

120
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,540
 That actress is that actress, right? 

121
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,050
 The one who got in by nepotism. 

122
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,080
 I got in by nepotism? 

123
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,910
 When? 

124
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,380
A Jeong.

125
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,130
- Are you crying? 
 - No.

126
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,020
Why would I cry?

127
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,610
My eyes are just watering because it's cold.

128
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,490
Why did you come out in this cold?

129
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,690
Here.

130
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,020
What is this?

131
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,720
It's my emergency fund.

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,510
If you happen to drink coffee together on the set,

133
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,860
you should treat everyone once.

134
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,970
It's important to be good at acting,

135
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,550
but it's also important to be liked by those you work with.

136
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,540
Forget it.

137
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,940
Who gains favor for doing stuff like that these days?

138
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,740
You never know, so just hold onto it.

139
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,750
- Soo Jeong would freak out if she sees this. 
 - Why are you doing this?

140
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,350
My eyes are cold.

141
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,840
Do your best. Okay?

142
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,920
And if you can't do it anymore, just quit whenever you want.

143
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,940
How could you say that?

144
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,680
As my mom, you should tell me to hang in there even if things get tough.

145
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,380
I mean...

146
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,870
I'm saying you don't need to hold onto everything so desperately.

147
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,970
I got it.

148
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,020
To be blunt, if things get too tough, just veer off into a different path.

149
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,400
That's also a path, isn't it?

150
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,350
That's way better than feeling small.

151
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,220
You know, not anyone can just go into those side paths.

152
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,620
Only those who went that far could see those paths.

153
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,670
Outsiders may say it's just an extra or a supporting role,

154
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,550
but to your dad and me,

155
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,820
you are always the star, A Jeong. Don't forget that. Okay?

156
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,370
It's not a child, right?

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,450
- Are you crazy? 
 - I got so scared it might be that.

158
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,800
Good. Great if it's not that.

159
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,500
- How could you think like that— 
 - Why am I thinking like that?

160
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,790
Why don't you just tell me instead of playing 20 Questions?

161
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,650
I told you it's not like that.

162
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,960
Are you sure?

163
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,590
You know that not saying it and lying are two different things, right?

164
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,500
If you're doing this when something is up,

165
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,120
you're lying to me right now.

166
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,640
Even if you lie to others, don't lie to me, Lee Do Han.

167
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,320
That means I can't trust anyone.

168
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,620
That would really suck.

169
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,610
You really aren't hiding anything from me?

170
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,440
   

171
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
A Jeong?

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,010
Hello?

173
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,100
Right now?

174
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It's fine. I'll leave right now.

175
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,510
Okay.

176
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,130
Leave? Says who?

177
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,300
Later. Let's talk again later. Okay?

178
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,540
You're going to meet that woman right now, right?

179
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,580
You can't. If you will, step over me.

180
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,800
Let me just ask you one thing. Why do you hate A Jeong that much?

181
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,680
Brother, that woman is using you to make me regret what I did.

182
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,790
Do you think she's like you and uses people?

183
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,210
Are you taking her side right now?

184
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm the one related to you. She's a total stranger.

185
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,360
Forget it. Move.

186
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,070
No, you can't.

187
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,390
All right. I'm sorry, then.

188
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,370
He actually stepped on me just because I told him to.

189
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,970
   

190
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,550
Oh? Sis, Sis, look at this.

191
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,420
"LJ Group makes a surprise announcement of successor Lee Do Han?"

192
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,830
"While living in New York,

193
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,470
he came back to South Korea for the birthday banquet of his grandfather, Chairman Hyeon Dae Ho."

194
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,710
Doesn't his name and situation match exactly with A Jeong's friend?

195
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,170
So, you're saying this man is that Jade Mat?

196
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,250
- Yeah. 
 - I already told you.

197
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,880
A Jeong has to be able to talk to him to become friends.

198
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,580
- How could she be friends with a conglomerate? 
 - I mean—

199
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,050
Welcome—

200
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,640
Jong Hee, you were here, too.

201
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,890
- Hello. 
 - I'll get an iced caffe latte.

202
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,410
What do you want to drink?

203
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,380
I'll take a cup of hot Earl Grey tea.

204
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,400
Oh, okay.

205
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,500
I-Is he that guy?

206
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,120
- Is he that guy? 
 - I-I'm 500% sure. 500% sure.

207
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,560
Love is one thing, but children? She went too far.

208
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,140
So why do you read fortunes when it's always wrong?

209
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,060
I don't know...

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,040
It's cheaper than therapy,

211
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,650
and it's easier to get into than neuropsychiatry?

212
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,280
This coffee...

213
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,960
It gives you a momentary energy boost even though you still get sleepy after.

214
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Reading fortunes is like that, too.

215
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,500
Nothing changes after hearing it,

216
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,050
but it feels like your thoughts get sorted out for a moment.

217
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,300
So...

218
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,610
how did you sort your thoughts?

219
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,380
Take my hand.

220
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,220
You said I'm the only one you can hold hands and run away.

221
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,090
Are you sure you won't regret it?

222
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,740
You said you don't want to be Joan of Arc.

223
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,790
After thinking about it, it doesn't seem so bad.

224
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,250
First, it is a solo female-lead drama.

225
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,930
And I also...

226
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,580
want to be where I am really needed for once in my life.

227
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,510
Not just anyone, nor in place of someone else,

228
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,760
but a role that only I can portray.

229
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,600
What you are offering me is exactly that.

230
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,490
A Jeong,

231
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,270
if I take your hand right now, we're really getting married.

232
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,400
You could think more and decide—

233
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,860
I won't think about it anymore.

234
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,280
I already thought it over enough.

235
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,560
From now on, I'll veer off into a side path with you.

236
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,630
I'm the only one who can take this side path since I came this far.

237
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,740
So, I'll decide whether I regret it or not at the end of that path.

238
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,260
   

239
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,360
Chairman,

240
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,760
there is great opposition from shareholders regarding your remarks

241
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,650
at your birthday banquet on the next leader.

242
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,750
I understand what you're saying.

243
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,710
I will reconsider the succession issue.

244
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,590
Happy now?

245
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:57,280
Even so, I am still thinking of teaching him the business again.

246
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,720
First... oh, right.

247
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,430
That Myeongju shopping mall complex...

248
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,060
How about we entrust him with that?

249
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,880
Well, the problem at the Bangkok shopping mall, which is soon to open next year, is growing severe.

250
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,860
The completion schedule is being delayed beyond what was initially promised to the Thai government.

251
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,830
If something were to go wrong on one side...

252
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:26,580
You're saying my younger brother Lee Do Han may take all the blame for it.

253
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,690
So, the groundbreaking was delayed again?

254
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,870
I cracked my nose and got my stomach stepped on

255
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,130
and yet Lee Do Han and Na A Jeong are sticking together like glue.

256
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,420
Yes, it appears they're really together.

257
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,560
Seeing how you've become bedridden like this because of Na A Jeong...

258
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,820
 The logic of life 

259
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,670
 is that you can't always be happy. 

260
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,800
 One day, there will come a day when you will fall. 

261
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,730
 Lee Ji Han, please remember my face when that day comes. 

262
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,210
As soon as I fell,

263
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,870
I really am remembering her face.

264
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,370
Well, I bought you some porridge.

265
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,040
Please eat some, even if you don't have an appetite.

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
I'll be going now.

267
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,340
   

268
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,860
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

269
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,620
She'll probably either enter or exit.

270
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,210
I won't back down nicely, either.

271
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,780
Carrot?

272
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,670
You didn't come to buy secondhand items?

273
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,100
I don't do stuff like that.

274
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,650
Oh, you didn't.

275
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,360
I thought you came to buy my son's mat.

277
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,630
I don't have a child.

278
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,880
Let's go, Ji Ho.

279
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,520
Dad, that man isn't even buying our mat,

280
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,750
so why is he there in front of someone else's house?

281
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,020
Wait.

282
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,570
Now that I think about it, I did come here to buy that.

283
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,300
 We used it carefully, so there are no scratches. 

284
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,670
It's got a nice cushion, too.

285
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,290
It also has Poli and Ambu. All of that.

286
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,570
What is this?

287
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,700
How did you get in here?

288
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,300
What do you think?

289
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,100
He graciously opened the door and guided me inside.

290
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,360
He came to buy Ji Ho's used mat.

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,470
He wanted to check for flaws, so he came in for a moment.

292
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,870
You need a Robocar Poli mat?

293
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,640
Wow, this mat is the perfect size for my living room.

294
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,820
By chance, do you two know each other?

295
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,990
No, I don't ever want to know him.

296
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,690
Well then, have a great transaction.

297
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,130
A Jeong, are you going to your shoot?

298
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,620
Yeah, what is it?

299
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,020
A Jeong, let's talk for a second—

300
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,950
Are you all right?

301
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,160
Why would you step on Poli?

302
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,350
Follow me out.

303
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,250
Your family doesn't know you quit that role?

304
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,420
Why? Will you stick your nose into my family matters now?

305
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,940
Mind your own business, seriously.

306
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,310
Hey, you told me to follow you out.

307
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,040
Doesn't that mean you'll talk to me?

308
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,190
Start your car. Hurry!

309
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,560
Pardon? W-What the...

310
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,820
My mom is coming.

311
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,060
But my mom said she was going to the park to give out some kimchi.

312
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,070
Why did she come back already?

313
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,480
She'd know I got cut from the drama if she saw me here like this.

314
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,830
So, your family doesn't know.

315
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,110
Hurry up and go. You said you wanted to talk.

316
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,430
I'll talk to you about anything. Just go.

317
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,840
Oh, right. What happened to that rumor, Chae Won?

318
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,870
Are you marrying the third grandson of LJ?

319
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,560
The third grandson of LJ? You mean the controversial Lee Do Han?

320
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,330
The one with the awesome looks?

321
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,890
Yes, he's good-looking. No, I'm not marrying him.

322
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,230
We're just friends.

323
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,680
Do you know their youngest grandson, too?

324
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,520
Why? Is there a rumor about the youngest, too?

325
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,980
You don't know? They're both so infamous.

326
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,980
The older brother runs away from blind dates, and the younger one tries to hook him up.

327
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,820
I heard he tried to set up his older brother with all the women from decent families.

328
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,300
You know, they're illegitimate.

329
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,910
The funny thing is that his older brother isn't interested, but he does all that by himself.

330
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,000
Goodness.

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,120
I've heard of a fussy mother-in-law but never a fussy brother-in-law.

332
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,630
But I'm glad you two aren't like that, Chae Won.

333
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,680
They aren't really on the same level.

334
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
I know.

335
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,230
The wealth to be inherited is totally on a different level.

336
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,090
You'll be marrying down, Chae Won.

337
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,960
- Of course, she could do better. 
 - Totally.

338
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,340
She could do way better than him.

339
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,440
I'm sorry. We're fully booked today.

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,320
I think you'll need to wait a bit.

341
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,880
Chae Won, you didn't make a reservation?

342
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,050
Hey, don't you know her?

343
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,860
Who are you telling to wait?

344
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,400
No need to apologize. I came without making a reservation.

345
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,810
It's okay.

346
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,690
Thank you for understanding.

347
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,240
You heard that, right? Who wants to wait?

348
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,580
What do you mean, wait? We all made reservations already.

349
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,610
Exactly. So who's going to wait in my place?

350
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,710
Why are you surprised? Isn't it wrong for me to wait while you guys go in first?

351
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,530
I mean, we're not on the same level.

352
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,960
- Hey, Yoon Chae Won— 
 - Will you wait in my place, Eun Seon?

353
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,310
Yeah, that sounds good.

354
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,060
The wealth to be inherited is totally on a different level between you and me.

355
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,950
How about you wait in my place, Yeon Joo?

356
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,520
Your mother is the second wife, right?

357
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,680
If you want to beat out the first wife's children,

358
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,200
shouldn't you kiss up to me, Taeyang Group's only daughter?

359
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,870
- Hey, Yoon Chae Won! 
 - What?

360
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,510
You don't want to hear this?

361
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,600
Then don't talk about people so lightly.

362
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,040
I don't like hearing it, either.

363
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,900
What's wrong with her?

364
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,220
- Did she go crazy? 
 - What did she just say?

365
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,970
- Gosh. What's with her? 
 - She's lost it.

366
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,960
What are you doing?

367
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,300
Will you strike the back of my head with that?

368
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,070
If things go wrong.

369
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,580
Seeing there's nobody around here,

370
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,160
and it's a perfect spot for you to bury me, a thorn in your side, Lee Ji Han.

371
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,630
Shouldn't I at least have a weapon to defend myself?

372
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,420
Haven't you watched too many dramas?

373
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,200
I mean...

374
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,110
why did you drag me all the way here when you wanted to talk?

375
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,300
Where is this supposed to be?

376
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,370
Rather than picking up a brick,

377
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,480
try to use your brain and look around.

378
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,200
   

379
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,800
"LJ Group's new shopping mall complex property?"

380
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,540
I'm sorry about what I did that day.

381
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,500
That was thoughtless of me.

382
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,400
You said it was okay to touch lottery money, but you shouldn't touch maturity savings.

383
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,070
This is what I consider my maturity savings.

384
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,210
I started this as an intern without my family's help,

385
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,160
and I even took care of the holdouts on this property recently.

386
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,540
Though this will be handed over as city property after 30 years,

387
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,880
my grandfather was going to entrust Brother with all of this until then.

388
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,250
Though it's finished business...

389
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,080
it's not over yet.

390
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,260
If you say you won't marry him,

391
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,080
and if CEO Yoon takes my brother who was dumped by you,

392
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,960
everything returns to its rightful place.

393
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,350
Apologize to me again.

394
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,270
- Pardon? 
 - I didn't hear it because you were so sloppy.

395
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,610
You should apologize to me again properly.

396
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,800
I'm sorry.

397
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,450
What I did that day was a bit messed up.

398
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,700
I have bad hearing, so I didn't hear that properly.

400
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,490
What did you say?

401
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,500
I'm sorry.

402
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,550
Maybe it's not my hearing.

403
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,900
I guess I couldn't hear you because you're too far.

404
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,700
Come closer and apologize.

405
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,600
Well, I'm really sorry.

406
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,550
What did you say?

407
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,590
I said I'm sorry.

408
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,400
Now, you seem like you're actually apologizing.

409
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,700
But too bad.

410
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,770
It's already too late, even if you begged.

411
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,630
Even if you apologize to me a thousand times,

412
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,340
I already made up my mind to marry Do Han.

413
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,500
But my mom was so right.

414
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,530
If a person lacks composure, that's how small you become.

415
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,920
What are you doing right now?

416
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,430
Are you toying with me?

417
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,430
And you just leave?

418
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,360
Are you going to walk?

419
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,980
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

420
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,080
Lee Ji Han!

421
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,290
Hey, you!

422
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,640
Sir, have you been well? What's the matter?

423
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,020
You've been well, right?

424
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,190
You ignored all my texts and calls after you got my seal on the contract.

425
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,400
And you ask if I've been well?

426
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,940
You have no conscience. How dare you come back here!

427
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,920
Should I leave, then? Okay, I'll come back next time.

428
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,950
Gosh, where do you think you're going, you bastard!

429
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,040
Gosh, you're in for it today. You're dead!

430
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,000
- Sir, sir! That hurts! 
 - How could you do that to me!

431
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
- Sir, sir! 
 - How could you ignore me

432
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
as soon as you got my seal?

433
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,800
Why, why, why? What's going on?

434
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,720
W-Why are you—

435
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,360
- What? 
 - It's my wife's friend!

436
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,850
Y-You're Ji Eun's friend. You sang the congratulatory song at our wedding, right?

437
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,110
Oh, the congratulatory song, yes.

438
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,040
- Hello! 
 - Ji Eun! Ji Eun!

439
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,280
Father, she sang the congratulatory song at our wedding.

440
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,680
Hello, Father.

441
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,170
- Oh, yeah, yeah! 
 - Yes.

442
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,250
Though it isn't much, please eat up.

443
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,370
If you are my daughter-in-law's friend, you're like family.

444
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,960
Gosh, what do you mean, it isn't much? This is like a king's feast.

445
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,280
Does Jang Geum live here or something? 
  (A famous cook who then became King Jungjong's royal physician) 

446
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,840
But what brings you here without even giving me a call?

447
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,230
I came out here to take care of some business,

448
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,200
and I just happened to run into your husband with such a great eye.

449
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,560
- It was such a surprise. 
 - Oh, really?

450
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,590
How interesting. Eat up.

451
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,360
Why are you looking at my daughter-in-law's friend like that?

452
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,300
You've been acting suspicious all along.

453
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,000
Is Ji Eun's friend really your sister-in-law?

454
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,650
Young Master, try some meat. 
  (Title you address your husband's younger brother) 

455
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,410
The meat melts in your mouth.

456
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,110
Try to play along if you can.

457
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,130
Unless you want your hair pulled out again.

458
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,970
Try some of this marinated crab, Sister-in-law.

459
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,320
- It's been marinated really well. 
 - Oh, good, good.

460
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,370
You're the only one who remembers what I like.

461
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,460
- Oh, my. 
 - Goodness.

462
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,280
- Are you all right? 
 - It's all right.

463
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,270
- It's okay. 
 - Why fall there of all places?

464
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,890
Here.

465
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,350
Why are you getting stuff on your mouth while you eat?

466
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,250
Sister-in-law, you're so kind.

467
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,940
You wiped my mouth with the tissue after wiping your pants.

468
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,130
I don't discriminate with my kindness.

469
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,020
Right...

470
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,070
Wow, they're all my favorite side dishes.

471
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,940
I missed your cooking the most while I was abroad, Aunt.

472
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,600
Why would you live abroad when you love Korean food so much?

473
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,920
Can't you just live in South Korea?

474
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,310
I heard you are thinking of getting married.

475
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,470
Is it that lady who ate two bowls of dried Pollack soup?

476
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,170
Goodness, she even picked the bones off a barley-dried yellow croaker.

477
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,740
Do Han, it's no problem for you to leave.

478
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,060
But I feel bad for Ji Han, who will be left alone again.

479
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,130
Why is everyone talking to me about Ji Han?

480
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,480
It's hard enough to take care of my own life.

481
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,860
While you were away, that reporter came to the house several times.

482
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,030
He said he came to meet Ji Han but only met with the chairman.

483
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,660
Why do you think he came? Probably to get money.

484
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,890
So, Do Han, you shouldn't blame Ji Han.

485
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,110
He already gets into a bad state every time it rains.

486
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,290
If you also hate him, there won't be any sunny days left for Ji Han.

487
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,050
Please keep it a secret from Grandfather that I came by.

488
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,390
Who the hell are you guys?

489
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,620
A two-man racketeering gang?

490
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,550
No wonder she was so excessive at the wedding.

491
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,880
It was because of this.

492
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,450
So, you can come back as my best friend and blackmail me?

493
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,620
Blackmail? Weren't you Na A Jeong's friend?

494
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,860
Who are you calling my friend?

495
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,730
She was paid to act as my friend at the wedding.

496
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,320
Anyway, I paid her the money I promised her that day.

497
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,820
And that money included the confidentiality fee.

498
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,920
Don't you dare embarrass me in front of my family.

499
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,830
If you try anything funny,

500
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,500
I will report you guys immediately.

501
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,830
What? You really didn't know?

502
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,440
You said she's your sister-in-law.

503
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,140
You'll need to watch out, too.

504
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,730
It means that the woman is deceiving you as well.

505
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,170
Wow, you really don't believe me?

506
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,650
Come on, that's ridiculous.

507
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,210
I'm serious!

508
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,500
I've done enough power-tripping.

509
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,810
But I've never seen a top luxury power tripping on a small luxury power.

510
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,650
You sure you didn't see wrong?

511
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,400
Chae Won did that to her friends just so she could get treatment first?

512
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,210
They talked some crap about Ji Han and Do Han while eating,

513
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,600
bringing up how they're illegitimate.

514
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,840
They were saying, "She freaked out even when they elevated her."

515
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,290
"Maybe she really likes their son."

516
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,640
This will spread as tabloid news 100%.

517
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,740
I can understand Yoon Chae Won telling them off.

518
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,420
But do you think she likes Lee Ji Han?

519
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,220
Young Miss, don't look down on my gut feeling.

520
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,480
I found out first when my husband was being arrested, too.

521
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,620
Honey, what could Chae Won possibly lack that she'd like Lee Ji Han?

522
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,760
I feel like you misread this one, Unni.

523
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,620
People's feelings aren't a fortune cookie.

524
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,240
It's easy to tell even without having to open it up.

525
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,060
When she was looking at Do Han, her eyes were glazed over.

526
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,200
Which of the two would she be looking at with romantic eyes?

527
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,770
You are wrong.

528
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,940
Young Miss.

529
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,620
Honey, let's go inside.

530
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,920
I think you're saying this because you're hungry.

531
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,880
I think you could use some food therapy.

532
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,530
Come inside.

533
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,760
At times like this, you two ignore me just because you're siblings. Damn it.

534
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,430
You're so unnecessarily hardworking.

535
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,760
So cute.

536
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,130
What is there to see in an empty emergency staircase?

537
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,280
Our Young Master Bang Won asked for it urgently. 
  (Third king of Joseon Dynasty) 

538
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,370
Oh? I think I found it.

539
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,910
Was Na A Jeong a school bully in the past or something?

540
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,110
I heard you aren't even friends with their daughter-in-law.

541
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,280
How deep do your lies go?

542
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,650
It's not lying. It's acting.

543
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,360
And you should act properly, too.

544
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,150
Instead of stuttering like earlier.

545
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,640
If I tell everyone, that act will be over, too.

546
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,570
No, you won't be able to say anything.

547
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,380
You'd also be put in a spot if I got exposed.

548
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,810
Gosh, seriously.

549
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,210
Yes! Lee Ji Han really was here!

550
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,360
Hey, give back our land right now!

551
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,790
You acted like you'd construct a shopping mall,

552
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,290
so why haven't you started it yet?

553
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,560
Right! You let our land sit idly for years and ruined the nearby commercial district.

554
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,310
You screwed the entire neighborhood. You know that?

555
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,200
Please calm down for now and listen to me—

556
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,940
No! You ignored our calls all this time. Listen to what?

557
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,420
- I don't care! Just give back our land! 
 - Right.

558
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,140
I won't let you take a step out of here until you give it back!

559
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,640
All right, all right. Quiet, quiet.

560
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,370
 We're in the same boat now. 

561
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,610
 I will help you, Lee Ji Han, so you help me, too. 

562
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,350
Where are you going in such a rush?

563
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,280
Oh, the district office.

564
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,500
- At this hour? 
 - All the neighbors are gathered there right now.

565
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,050
Gosh, hurry.

566
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,690
For those of you with questions,

567
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,470
please raise your hand and ask me. I'll answer your questions.

568
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,640
Me, me, me.

569
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,800
365 Mart...

570
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,580
Ma'am of 365 Mart, please give us your question.

571
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,000
It's true LJ scammed us, right?

572
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,730
It wasn't a scam.

573
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,530
On our way here, I noticed they were constructing a big bridge over there.

574
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,370
They are in the process of remodeling the bus terminal, too.

575
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,600
- The mister from the car repair center. 
 - What does that have to do with LJ?

576
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,280
There is a connection.

577
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,390
All this is happening with the money donated by LJ.

578
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,160
If not, where would so much money have come from?

579
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,210
Not only that, the property rights to the mall will be given to the city after 30 years.

580
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,330
Did you all know about that?

581
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,260
A boon to tax revenue expansion.

582
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,430
The city of Myeongju is already improving.

583
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,970
I mean, if it is such a boon,

584
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,380
why is this bastard Lee Ji Han not picking up our calls?

585
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,240
And he stopped coming by, too!

586
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,110
That's right! He was trying to look out for himself!

587
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,710
No, no. Everyone...

588
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,540
It turned out no news doesn't necessarily mean good news.

589
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,990
Gosh, he told me not to mention this...

590
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,220
What is it? What is it?

591
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,330
In this situation, you should tell us everything.

592
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,550
It's okay. Just let it all out.

593
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,810
Hurry up and tell us!

594
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,000
All right.

595
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,020
To tell you the truth, Lee Ji Han was in a car accident recently.

596
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,100
An accident?

597
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,490
So, though he's not even fully recovered yet,

598
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,640
he kept saying he needed to come back here,

599
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,420
so I brought him.

600
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,490
To my Young Master, he said this place was everything to him.

601
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,540
As precious as maturity savings.

602
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,410
 This is what I consider my maturity savings. 

603
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,750
But if you found out he got injured, he said you would get nervous

604
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,020
and get worried like this, and he didn't want that.

605
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,460
So, we were going to drop by quietly like this,

606
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,560
but you all ended up finding out everything.

607
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,070
If that was the case, you should have told us sooner!

608
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,770
Are you feeling okay now?

609
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm okay.

610
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,060
But, everyone, would someone who's out for himself

611
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,520
have cared about stuff like that?

612
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,360
Would he care?

613
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,240
I don't think so.

614
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,420
 - Right. 
 - She's right. 

615
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,630
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,410
Since you're holding a mic, sing a song, young lady.

617
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,300
What should I sing for you?

618
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,030
Sing a song! Yeah, a song!

619
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,010
Oh, yes, that's great! Pretty girl!

620
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,380
"Oh, My Goodness"? "Oh, My Goodness"?

621
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,190
Yeah, sounds good!

622
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,640
 "Oh, My Goodness." Nice, let's go! 

623
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,930
 Right on. Come on! 

624
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,150
Everyone get up, get up!

625
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,120
 Let's get up! 

626
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,600
She's like a cult leader.

627
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,290
Let's go.

628
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,380
♫  Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness, don't be like this  ♫

629
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,470
♫  A woman's heart is like a wavering reed  ♫

630
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,930
♫  No, why are you like this? Don't ask me  ♫

631
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,800
♫  Do not smile at me any longer  ♫

632
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,890
Nice, that's great!

633
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,780
♫  I met you for the first time today  ♫

634
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,420
 The bus is about to depart. Please get on the bus. 

635
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,950
 Let me make this announcement one more time. 

636
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,410
You haven't eaten anything. Why would you get indigestion?

637
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,300
Isn't it weirder to digest in that situation?

638
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,520
All that is part of the act.

639
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,430
Method acting.

640
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,380
Not anyone can do that.

641
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,930
I also don't do this for just anyone.

642
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,500
But I can only get back to Seoul if the driver gets better.

643
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,580
Thank you for today.

644
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,620
You know how to say stuff like that, Lee Ji Han?

645
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,980
And I'm sorry.

646
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,630
Getting you the role through nepotism when you never asked for it.

647
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,720
I didn't consider the original owner of that opportunity.

648
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,020
And I didn't think you'd think that far, either.

649
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,600
And I didn't realize you would

650
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,380
get hurt, either.

651
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,510
Don't apologize to me, Lee Ji Han.

652
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,280
You don't need to do it alone when I didn't apologize.

653
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:13,030
Your dream was probably as precious to you as my dream was to me.

654
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,270
I know that, from your perspective, I ruined everything.

655
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,380
And I know that we are doing what we shouldn't do to each other.

656
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,390
But I'm not going to apologize.

657
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,920
Because you have to choose my brother?

658
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,220
Lee Ji Han, you should just keep hating me, too.

659
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,650
I'll do the same.

660
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,070
I feel that would be more comfortable for both of us.

661
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,580
What the...

662
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,460
Terry...

663
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,360
Your brother has finally lost his mind.

664
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,530
So, did Do Han have a nice visit?

665
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,680
What?

666
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,560
How did I know?

667
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,780
This is my house.

668
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,820
I know everything that happens in my house.

669
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,770
I'm sorry, Chairman.

670
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,100
Also, in my house,

671
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,110
no one better hear about what I never said.

672
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,860
Yes, sir.

673
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,280
All right.

674
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,800
 Chairman, this is Reporter Kang Ik Joon. 

675
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,410
 I wanted to say hi and see how you were doing. 

676
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,690
He won't read them, huh?

677
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,060
Pardon?

678
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,530
No, it's nothing.

679
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,960
But will anything come up just because we wait here like this?

680
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,840
Something will come up. For sure.

681
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,200
I've done this for the last 20 years, and there hasn't been a single time nothing came up.

682
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,350
They even published an article saying they aren't in a relationship.

683
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,460
When these people say no, it means yes.

684
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,950
And when they say yes, it means no.

685
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,580
But no could actually mean no, and yes mean yes.

686
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,560
See? See?

687
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,020
They never deviate from my expectations.

688
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Hey, this is why I can never give up.

689
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,670
All right...

690
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,230
It looks delicious.

691
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
Why are you looking at me like that?

692
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,580
It's not your first time eating banquet noodles, right?

693
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,080
I've had banquet noodles before.

694
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,640
It's the first time Lee Do Han asked me to meet up first.

695
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,650
Oh, right. Do you like Ji Han by chance?

696
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,540
What are you talking about?

697
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,000
Why are you suddenly saying something so ridiculous?

698
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,320
It seemed to make sense to me.

699
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,860
When I think about it, I feel like you were always into Ji Han.

700
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,850
My sister-in-law kept talking about it.

701
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,450
I heard you got into a fight trying to take Ji Han's side.

702
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,160
That was because they were talking too lightly about Ji Han.

703
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,540
You know how people talk easily about others.

704
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,820
Just let it be next time.

705
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,750
You'd be put on the spot if some weird rumors spread.

706
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,790
But Ji Han will be touched when he hears about this

707
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,540
since you were Ji Han's first love.

708
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,030
Wait, stop right there.

709
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,080
If you move right now,

710
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,100
they may know that I see them.

711
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,650
How did you know that reporters were on our tail?

712
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,210
I wonder how I couldn't have known it was him sooner.

713
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,250
Who is it? Is it a reporter you know?

714
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,990
I know him. All too well.

715
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,620
Let's eat for now.

716
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,680
   

717
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,380
No one trusts their news.

718
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,090
It's no different from tabloids.

719
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,750
Why do you think the two of them met by themselves?

720
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,420
It was probably nothing.

721
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,310
Oh? You're not on a copium trip today?

722
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,160
There's no point.

723
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,350
Na A Jeong seems set on marrying Brother even if someone puts a knife to her throat.

724
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,160
I'm much more annoyed by this.

725
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,940
The photo of them together I wanted is posted on a low-class site.

726
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,410
What's the name of the reporter?

727
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,410
Just a moment.

728
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,110
It's here. It's Reporter Kang Ik Joon.

729
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,730
Who?

730
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,160
 The reporter who was involved in the case of President Hyeon Soo Hyeon's death. 

731
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,820
Oh, you're right.

732
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,190
Why did I have to forget that name? This is driving me nuts!

733
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,970
Geez, he's such a scumbag.

734
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,560
Even early in his career, he chased President Hyeon Soo Hyeon everywhere.

735
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,400
Now, he's even doing that to his son?

736
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,560
It looks like things went south this time again, huh?

737
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,830
Yeah. I looked up the drama title online,

738
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,630
and Sis's name wasn't on the cast list.

739
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,990
It's pretty obvious.

740
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,330
With A Jeong's personality, she was probably unable to mention it first

741
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,870
since she bragged about it so much.

742
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:15,090
Still, we can't keep acting like we don't know.

743
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,170
All right. Who wants to ask her this time?

744
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,700
I asked her last time when she broke up with her boyfriend.

745
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,780
Okay, you get a pass.

746
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,370
I asked her last time when Auntie got laid off.

747
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,990
You get a pass, too.

748
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:33,450
I broke the news of what happened at a secondhand transaction recently.

749
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,480
- You win. 
 - Do we have to ask her?

750
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,770
I can pretend not to know and wait until A Jeong brought it up first.

751
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,350
How will you pretend not to know?

752
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,030
Among the five of us, you're the worst at acting.

753
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:52,780
You'll make it obvious that you know and hurt A Jeong's ego even more.

754
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,280
This is really true.

755
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,930
Even A Jeong said so.

756
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,980
That her acting ability has nothing to do with Father's genes.

757
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,230
Gosh, that troublemaker!

758
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,440
She's the one who got cut. Why do we have to tiptoe around her?

759
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,080
What are you doing?

760
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,710
Oh, us? We were eating fruit.

761
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,190
There isn't any fruit, Dad.

762
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,530
What?

763
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,450
It's good that you guys are all gathered here.

764
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,020
I had something I wanted to say to my family.

765
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,360
Oh, okay.

766
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,110
All right.

767
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,500
We're ready to listen. Hurry up and tell us.

768
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,140
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

769
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,730
Dad.

770
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,480
Soo Jeong.

771
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,560
Brother-in-law.

772
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,930
And Ji Ho...

773
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,800
I'm getting married.

774
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,080
Hey, what did she say?

775
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,640
- What? 
 - S-So suddenly?

776
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,300
Hey, A Jeong?

777
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,680
You do know this is indoors, right?

778
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,090
And a half-basement at that.

779
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,940
I know.

780
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,990
What's with the sunglasses and your outfit?

781
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,540
I heard there's a reporter tailing you.

782
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,010
And there was also a news article on you.

783
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:29,590
Doesn't that mean even I could get photographed since I'm with you today?

784
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,820
Is he here today?

785
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,160
Where do you think he is?

786
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,080
He's not that kind of a reporter.

787
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,270
This is a really tiresome issue.

788
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,570
I know. I know that, but...

789
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,920
today is the first time I'm getting photographed for an article.

790
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,010
I can't believe a reporter who's after the most influential women picked by Forbes could be on our tail.

791
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,340
It's so cool.

792
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,420
And it's not just because of that.

793
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,430
I also wanted to dress up, looking like a top actress

794
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,220
and negotiate a contract once.

795
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,800
Have you read it?

796
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,540
Yeah. It was well organized.

797
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,090
Really?

798
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,900
But in the fifth article,

799
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,960
I want you to revise the reason for our breakup.

800
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,910
But isn't it most common to break up over differences in personalities?

801
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,790
No, no. The reason we break up should be with me.

802
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,390
- Not me, but you? 
 - Yeah.

803
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,600
Think about it.

804
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,160
You have money, cars, and a company.

805
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,320
And you even had such an incredible marriage candidate.

806
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,960
But we get divorced because of you?

807
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,130
What would people think, then?

808
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,080
They'll say people should marry their own kind and whatnot.

809
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,640
What's wrong with that?

810
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,470
People will feel sorry for you, then.

811
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,210
That's what I don't want.

812
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,970
Instead of becoming a woman everyone feels sorry for,

813
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,940
I'd rather choose to be a crazy bitch who would even leave a conglomerate.

814
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,060
Fix it.

815
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,130
Pity, no.

816
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,260
Pity, no.

817
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,500
Crazy bitch, yes.

818
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,650
Oh, and regarding this part...

819
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,730
where you will provide an incentive whenever ancestral rites happen every year...

820
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,580
I want you to take this out, too.

821
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:15,420
Even though it's acting, I feel guilty about accepting money on days like that.

822
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,940
But for action scenes...

823
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,690
For action scenes, there is a risk of danger,

824
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,140
so you will pay me extra whenever that happens.

825
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,780
Action? What action scene?

826
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,280
Write down what I tell you.

827
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,370
For example, if I have to flee to another country

828
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,550
as a result of a conspiracy plotted by the conglomerate's family,

829
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,580
or if I face a threat to my personal safety and get stabbed...

830
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,200
Nothing like that would happen.

831
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,870
And make the maturity rating age 15+.

832
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,830
If there are no special situations, light acts of physical affection

833
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,940
such as holding hands and hugging are fine.

834
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,940
But if you go past that level,

835
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,940
you will have to find a replacement for the lead character,

836
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,510
so keep that in mind.

837
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,800
Shall we stop here for the day?

838
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,490
Okay.

839
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,780
You just have to sign here.

840
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,690
   

841
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,750
- Deal? 
 - Deal!

842
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,210
Let's go and prepare our drama.

843
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,030
Okay.

844
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,940
You said we should live in New York.

845
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,280
Won't your grandfather have to give up on you and cast you out?

846
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,910
Don't you think that would be so much easier

847
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,920
than asking for permission and persuading him?

848
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,660
So, you're saying we should make him continue to oppose us, right?

849
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,600
Na A Jeong, you're brilliant!

850
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,630
Eloping for love.

851
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,000
That is our concept.

852
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,000
- This is so simple and pretty. 
 - Oh, you're right.

853
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,800
Is it possible to take these with us today if we buy them?

854
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,110
We will prepare them for you as soon as possible once you order them.

855
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:21,500
Then, could you show us only the ones we could buy and take with us today?

856
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,230
Okay, give me a moment, please.

857
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,580
Hey, how are your other family members besides your grandfather?

858
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,630
Aside from Lee Ji Han, I heard you have an older brother and older sister.

859
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,390
I'm not sure. They really hate being in the same space as me,

860
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,470
so won't they treat you the same since I'm bringing you?

861
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,280
Then they will 100% welcome me.

862
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,020
- Why? 
 - You said they hate you.

863
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:47,180
Isn't it better for them that you're bringing me instead of someone Grandfather has for you?

864
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,220
We are all okay with this, right?

865
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,500
The woman that Lee Do Han is bringing.

866
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,170
Seung Ah, of course.

867
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,960
It's so much better for him to marry a nobody than Taeyang Group's Chae Won.

868
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,990
Honey, I'll allow it just this once,

869
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,280
so keep complimenting that woman, saying she's pretty.

870
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,680
I'm not really happy about complimenting some other woman besides you,

871
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,720
but I'll try my best.

872
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,210
I know, I know.

873
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,740
I understand how you feel, Honey.

874
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,480
Just think of it as acting, okay?

875
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,550
- Seung Ah. 
 - Yeah?

876
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,810
Today, you are looking so pr—

877
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,600
You are quite pr—

878
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,950
I can't do it.

879
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,250
Gosh, I am quite pretty, I guess.

880
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,050
Why are you so pretty, seriously?

881
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,630
What can I do? I was born this way.

882
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:42,050
Since they don't actually like me, and they have a purpose,

883
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,530
I don't think we need to worry.

884
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,530
What do you think about this?

885
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,770
I think this one is prettier than the other one.

886
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,840
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

887
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,100
- Doesn't it look too refined? 
 - No, it looks pretty.

888
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,930
I think the other one was better.

889
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,800
Should we agree on our dating story?

890
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,780
- Our dating story? 
 - Yeah.

891
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,140
We were friends for a long time

892
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,120
and started dating five years ago.

893
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,750
But we were on and off because we were in a long-distance relationship,

894
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,880
before meeting up recently, that lit a spark.

895
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,500
What do you think?

896
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,610
How far are you preparing the story?

897
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:19,460
Hey, a script is a necessity in acting.

898
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,750
- I'll go with this one. 
 - Yeah, it looks pretty.

899
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,870
- I'll take both that one and the other one. 
 - Okay.

900
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,190
What is this? What brings you here?

901
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,610
I came to see you, CEO Yoon.

902
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,950
It looks like they're filming something.

903
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,070
Maybe someone you know is over there.

904
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,530
There isn't.

905
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,440
Let's go.

906
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,630
Why? Do you want to see something else?

907
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,210
No, I'm fine. Let's go.

908
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,870
I saw the picture in the article.

909
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,380
You never met him when I begged you to,

910
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,550
so what made you meet my brother?

911
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,180
It was nothing.

912
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,610
I just cooperated with him because he said he was looking into something.

913
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:35,250
You two eating together is something major to me.

914
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:40,000
Don't you remember I even got you on a plane to get you to eat with him?

915
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Oh, right.

916
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,510
He tried to talk to a newbie actress and got a warning from her manager.

917
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,230
- Oh, really? 
 - Don't laugh!

918
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,040
That nepotism was much prettier, though.

919
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,300
And she had such a cool personality, too.

920
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,390
I wonder what she's doing now.

921
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,990
If you're curious, look up her social media and send her a DM.

922
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,490
Should I? I think she'd respond right away since she's not so famous.

923
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:01,540
- Hey, bring me the script! 
 - Okay!

924
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,670
I'm sorry.

925
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,510
CEO Yoon, do you know what I hate the most?

926
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,640
Half-assing it.

927
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,510
Things should be done right.

928
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,150
Both work...

929
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,760
and apologies.

930
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,220
Are you all right?

931
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,190
You should watch where you're going.

932
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,060
I'm sorry.

933
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,080
Are you all right?

934
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,740
Yeah.

935
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,940
Are you all right?

936
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,620
What the hell? You're doing this on purpose, right?

937
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,740
What do you mean on purpose?

938
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,130
Why would I do that?

939
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,840
 Who are you that you make me have such vulgar regrets? 

940
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,880
I apologized.

941
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,060
So, you should apologize properly, too...

942
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,090
to the pretty woman with a cool personality.

943
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,660
I don't what this is about, but I'm sorry. Satisfied?

944
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,480
Stop it. I'm really all right.

945
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,990
Hey, Lee Do Han, let me ask you one final time.

946
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,620
Will you really be fine with giving up on everything?

947
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,210
I mean, I saw a teaser of it,

948
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:03,340
and this doesn't seem to be on just any scale.

949
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,000
Will you really not regret it?

950
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,400
I won't.

951
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,200
Okay then.

952
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,720
I already put on my wings. Let's run away together.

953
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,220
Do you have a plan for when we're inside?

954
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,600
Hey, of course, I do.

955
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,950
I prepared the three things that elders hate the most.

956
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,100
Honey, eat up.

957
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,810
You're the best.

958
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,280
- Eat up, Honey. 
 - Okay.

959
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,670
 It might be too obvious if I try too hard for his disapproval. 

960
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,400
 First, I need to be shy and awkward in my attitude 

961
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,070
 that says I want to look good to them. 

962
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,470
 But they will never be able to. Why? 

963
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,000
Rolled omelet.

964
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,290
 Have you ever seen elders who like a picky eater? 

965
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,620
 I haven't. 

966
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,680
I don't like soy sauce beans.

967
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,250
It's okay. Please eat up.

968
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,950
Please eat up.

969
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,830
Fish.

970
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,450
Please enjoy it.

971
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,290
Oh, wait.

972
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,550
What is it? Do you need something?

973
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,260
Well...

974
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,820
she asked if we had any Vienna sausages.

975
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,440
I see our new sister-in-law really likes sausages.

976
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,740
We have some leftovers from our kids' last time, right?

977
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,270
Please grill them for her.

978
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,390
Okay.

979
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:38,200
- Please grill them in the shape of an octopus. 
 - Okay.

980
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,960
- Thank you so much. 
 - Sure.

981
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,150
Nice.

982
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,910
You guys look so good together, right?

983
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,420
Yeah, this is great.

984
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,910
It's such a happy occasion for our family.

985
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,940
Did you know this is the first time Do Han brought a girl home?

986
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,700
Oh, really?

987
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,750
Is that so?

988
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,720
How many times did you bring a girl home, Brother?

989
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,200
Pardon?

990
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,870
I'm just joking.

991
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,530
You're so mischievous.

992
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,850
Gosh, Grandfather, you should smile a bit.

993
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,550
Shouldn't we give our blessing

994
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,140
to the fruition of their love?

995
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,340
I know. A Jeong, if you want to make Grandfather feel better,

996
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,910
you should bear him great-grandchildren soon.

997
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,530
 And this is where the second thing comes into play. 

998
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,680
 Talking back to your elders. 

999
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,980
I'm sorry to say this while you're talking, but

1000
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,350
I don't think that way.

1001
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,120
About what?

1002
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,200
The fruition of love doesn't necessarily mean marriage and children.

1003
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:50,000
I believe the fruition of love is growth and happiness.

1004
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,580
A Jeong, what I mean is—

1005
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,310
With that said, we don't plan to have children.

1006
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,440
 Coming out as a DINK couple in the first meeting. 

1007
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,650
- Oops. 
  - There's no way that will look good. 

1008
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,480
You guys can drink your tea here.

1009
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,600
I'll have a conversation with this young lady for a moment.

1010
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,390
Let's have a talk.

1011
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,390
Oh, okay.

1012
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,200
Let me be a part of it, too.

1013
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,330
No, stay and talk to your siblings.

1014
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:23,240
- Will you be okay? 
  - At this time, I'll put the final nail in the coffin. 

1015
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,470
 The third and last thing. 

1016
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,350
My Do Han, be a good boy.

1017
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:29,000
An oblivious public display of affection.

1018
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,470
What? What is it?

1019
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,220
She's looney.

1020
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,810
She's absolutely nuts.

1021
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:53,040
A weirdo has come into our family.

1022
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,130
Gosh, so flippant of her.

1023
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,620
- Let go of me! 
 - Gosh, what kind of situation is this?

1024
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,710
That woman is crazy, right?

1025
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,990
Did she set out to bring us to ruin?

1026
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,530
Her common sense is as small as a rabbit's liver.

1027
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:06,710
She left it at home.

1028
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:11,260
If not, how could she act like that if she's here for marriage approval?

1029
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,080
Fine.

1030
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,300
Let's forget about everything else.

1031
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,260
But what was this?

1032
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,010
- What was this? 
 - Stop it. It's gross.

1033
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,670
Do you think Grandfather will let you marry that woman Na A Jeong like that?

1034
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,250
I will marry A Jeong even if he keeps saying no.

1035
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,770
What is this? Am I speaking a different language?

1036
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:33,280
You should try to get his approval, no matter what.

1037
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
It looks like you're the crazy one, Brother.

1038
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,450
You've totally lost it.

1039
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,470
Na A Jeong.

1040
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,970
Yes?

1041
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,900
Didn't you say you would break up with him before?

1042
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:59,500
- Yes. 
 - Can I ask you why you changed your mind?

1043
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,870
I didn't like seeing him go through a hard time because of me.

1044
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,380
Do Han was going through a hard time...

1045
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,840
So, the reason Do Han was having a hard time was all because of you?

1046
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,860
No, that's probably not the only reason,

1047
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:26,130
but I did not want to be any part of those reasons.

1048
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,910
Whenever I felt like I couldn't do something,

1049
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:37,460
Do Han was the only person who always told me,

1050
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,610
"No, you can do it."

1051
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:44,160
Marriage, wife, and husband...

1052
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,840
Apart from all that,

1053
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,200
Lee Do Han is my best friend.

1054
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,030
So?

1055
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:57,350
That is why, if this is the opposite situation,

1056
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:01,420
I don't want to make him feel any despair.

1057
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,710
That is my conclusion.

1058
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,010
I understand even if you disapprove of me.

1059
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:11,950
No matter what you decide, Grandfather,

1060
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,520
I will accept it.

1061
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,320
I know what you're thinking.

1062
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,940
Just don't say it.

1063
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,750
What am I thinking?

1064
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,650
You are already saying it with your eyes.

1065
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:45,920
"How do I take care of this troublemaker?"

1066
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,320
That's right.

1067
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,300
No matter how much I think about it, there's only one answer to taking care of you.

1068
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,880
Do Han...

1069
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,490
Are you saying she's the reason

1070
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,470
you gave up everything and wouldn't marry any of the decent women...

1071
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,290
I tried to introduce you to?

1072
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:07,100
Yes.

1073
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:12,690
Grandfather, even if you disapprove, we will go through with our marriage.

1074
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:14,990
If you say you want me out of your sight,

1075
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:18,220
we will go to New York together and live quietly.

1076
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,620
So you won't have to see me.

1077
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,810
There's no need for that.

1078
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,850
You said this to me on the day we drank together.

1079
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,540
That it's typical for younger brothers to think about

1080
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,630
how they can take their brother's clothes, things, and food.

1081
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,960
I don't care what Brother eats or wears.

1082
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,770
But I found one thing I wanted to steal from Brother.

1083
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,830
I'm going to allow your marriage.

1084
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:56,850
Pardon?

1085
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,730
I said, I'll allow it.

1086
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,410
What is that?

1087
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,690
Na A Jeong.

1088
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:03,050
Excuse me?

1089
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,210
It's you, Na A Jeong.

1090
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:12,030
I'll try to steal you away from Brother.

1091
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:23,950


1092
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:39,870
♫  A sky filled with clouds, we fly high, get away  ♫

1093
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:45,070
♫  In your arms, way high, left away  ♫

1094
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:50,120
♫  In your arms, way above and high  ♫

1095
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:55,850
♫  To you, oh yeah  ♫

1096
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:02,390
♫  The wind raises its hands and embraces my cheeks  ♫

1097
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:07,650
♫  Shining like it's burning, all the perfect timing  ♫

1098
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:11,480
♫  A scent that fills the air  ♫

1099
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,470
♫  Over the skyline, dive down past it  ♫

1100
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,650
♫  I fly with you  ♫

1101
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,720
   

1102
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,270
 I made up my mind. 

1103
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,060
 I'll seduce you real good 

1104
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,650
 and kick you to the curb. 

1105
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,730
 You said you'll seduce me? 

1106
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,900
 If you're that confident, give it a shot. 

1107
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,380
 I'm also curious if I'd find you attractive and fall for you. 

1108
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,390
 We are going on a date. 

1109
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,510
 What do you think? Do you find me attractive now? 

1110
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:43,930
 I really can't do without A Jeong. 

1111
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:48,060
 Why do you keep getting hurt in front of me? 

1112
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,950
 Weren't you the one who hated me the most, Lee Ji Han? 

1113
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,100
 I must like you, then. 

1114
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:59,570
♫  To you, oh, oh, yeah  ♫
