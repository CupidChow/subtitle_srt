1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,059
Chairman Hyun Dae-ho
has led LJ Group so far.

2
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,313
But after his sudden announcement,

3
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,356
one incident is being mentioned.

4
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,652
It's the accident that killed
the late CEO Hyun Su-hyeon.

5
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:13,908
Despite a witness statement that
someone was chasing her car at the time

6
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:14,992
of the accident,

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,037
the case was closed
as an accidental death.

8
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,124
We're accepting
the results of the investigation.

9
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,420
There are still doubts
about the investigation process.

10
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,756
Some say her affair partner was involved.

11
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,634
And some say that her husband,
former mayor of Seoul,

12
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,512
had been the one chasing her at the time.

13
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,430
But these doubts subsided

14
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:39,099
when he denied any conflict between them.

15
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,393
But the strangest part about this

16
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,812
was Chairman Hyun.

17
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,897
Despite all the rumors,

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,899
he had always kept quiet.

19
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,986
So why did he
suddenly reveal his third grandson?

20
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,155
What really happened back then?

21
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,573
-Jeez.
-If you liked...

22
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,868
We've watched so many videos!

23
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:01,205
I thought we were
just going to see who they were.

24
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,331
It seems

25
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,001
marrying into a rich family
isn't all that great.

26
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,964
What if something happens to A-jung there?

27
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,134
He covered up the truth
when his daughter died.

28
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,761
It's all just gossip.

29
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,390
They just made a video
out of rumors going around.

30
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,183
Algorithms are fate.

31
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,727
The fact that we saw that video

32
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,437
means something.

33
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,689
-You know?
-Tae-min!

34
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:31,986
Are you trying to curse A-jung?
Do you want something to happen to her?

35
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,907
Rich people are no different.
They're humans too, you know.

36
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,701
Besides,

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,203
even if they do crazy things,

38
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,622
what would they do to her?

39
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,086
I'm asking just in case.

40
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,213
Do you like me?

41
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,508
-No.
-Then why did you say that?

42
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,468
It sounded like you did.

43
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,595
I was only

44
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,638
being honest.

45
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,183
I don't like you, but I plan to steal you.

46
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,312
Why?

47
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,356
If you fall for me,
you won't marry Do-han.

48
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,193
Be dumbfounded

49
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,486
and get butterflies.

50
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,698
It's my turn to make you feel like that.

51
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,244
And in the end, you'll have fallen for me.

52
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,335
I've made up my mind.

53
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,754
I'll seduce you

54
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,173
and dump you.

55
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,386
I'll accept it.

56
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,185
Why are you surprised?

57
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,354
You said you wouldn't.

58
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,231
I never said that.

59
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,235
I asked what you'd do
if I didn't allow it.

60
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,364
Look. He says he'll allow it.

61
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,990
Just say thank you.

62
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,367
What's the problem?

63
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,453
-He's right.
-I guess he's shocked.

64
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,123
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

65
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,750
Congratulations.

66
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,834
Congratulations.

67
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,297
All right.

68
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:18,300
Get your stuff from New York
before your marriage.

69
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,390
Hey, you brat.

70
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,643
You should answer him
and say you'll do it. Why...

71
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,898
But why would he move here?

72
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,441
What do you mean, why?

73
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,319
He has to learn work.

74
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,448
I haven't changed my mind.
Regardless of the marriage,

75
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,743
I'm putting Do-han
in charge of the company.

76
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,872
Ji-han.

77
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:54,003
Did you get butterflies because of me?

78
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:55,546
What?

79
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,299
You just said it was your turn
to make me feel like that.

80
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,510
That means

81
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,638
you felt that way about me before.

82
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,933
That's not all I said.

83
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,268
You get on my nerves.

84
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,519
Well, it's true

85
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,563
I was dumbfounded because of you,

86
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,897
but I don't

87
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,400
get butterflies.

88
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,653
You don't need to pretend like you don't.

89
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,613
My face,

90
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,532
my voice.

91
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,368
It's strange not to get butterflies.

92
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,246
No, I'm not pretending.

93
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,040
I really don't.

94
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,795
I guess you were so nervous earlier.
Just wait.

95
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,672
You'll feel it later.

96
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,973
I really don't.

97
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,604
Then I guess it's because it's chilly.

98
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,940
No, it's not that.

99
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,630
You feel it, right?

100
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,634
-You were lying.
-Have you lost your mind?

101
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,177
What's wrong with you?

102
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:31,100
I came here today
to get permission to marry Do-han.

103
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,518
And you're not crazy?

104
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,645
That attitude in there?

105
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,106
Being picky, talking back,

106
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,273
patting his butt?

107
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,401
Whatever. I don't want to talk to you.

108
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,904
Go back inside.

109
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,406
You can't be a good wife to him.

110
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,575
I know that

111
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,036
-more than anyone.
-You know,

112
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,998
you're not a good brother to him either.

113
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,170
Plus, you say you'll seduce me?

114
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:06,468
I'm not sure I'd fall
for someone so brazen and despicable.

115
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,222
But if you're so confident, try me.

116
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,018
I'm curious
whether or not I'll fall for you.

117
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,746
This is so harsh.

118
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,417
He's not your only grandson.

119
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,170
I'm your grandson too,

120
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,588
and I'm the eldest!

121
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:50,220
I stayed by your side and led the company
while he did whatever he wanted!

122
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,141
Honey.

123
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,143
Let go of me! Am I wrong?

124
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,896
All of you, go. I'm tired.

125
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,274
To be blunt,
you just took him and Ji-han in.

126
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,864
-What?
-And Mother died

127
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,741
because of him...

128
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,950
Oh, my gosh!

129
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,577
Honey.

130
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,997
How dare you...

131
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,335
Let's get this straight.

132
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,632
I'm the one who's led the company
and cleaned up your mess.

133
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,891
I'm tired. Leave.

134
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,811
Grandfather.

135
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,981
Honey, are you okay?

136
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,191
Let me see.

137
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,442
Oh, my God!

138
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,652
Darn it.

139
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,153
Honey!

140
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,907
Damn it...

141
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:25,816
Honey.

142
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,335
That was for Do-han.

143
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,921
Min-woong got slapped. This is only fair.

144
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,924
Ji-han.

145
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,343
Let's keep things fair.

146
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,265
You took away our mom.
You shouldn't take the company too.

147
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,058
Don't you think?

148
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,186
You should know your place.

149
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,731
I'm only

150
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,985
leaving you be

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,864
because you're no match for me.

152
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,825
But

153
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,705
you keep getting greedy
without being grateful.

154
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,376
Min-woong got slapped, so you too.

155
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,171
You caused all this.

156
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,347
Let go of me.

157
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,099
Let go.

158
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,252
Grandfather

159
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
permitted us

160
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,715
to marry.

161
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,188
EPISODE 4

162
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,615
Hello, sir.

163
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,166
He fired seven directors
who supported the chairman

164
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,127
and hired ones who support him.

165
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,047
He's trying to get more people
on his side since his kids

166
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,842
might not succeed the company.

167
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,053
If he has more than half of the board
on his side,

168
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,597
he could go against the chairman.

169
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,641
He's coming.

170
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,118
Trash.

171
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,746
-Pardon?
-Clean it up.

172
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,291
It's on the floor.

173
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,797
Oh, trash...

174
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,841
He startled me.

175
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,552
He could've cleaned it himself.

176
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,305
He has the most shares after the chairman.

177
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,349
Why is he ordering him to clean up trash?

178
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,311
Can't you do your job properly?

179
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,022
Why is Lee Ji-han still there?

180
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,065
He has to stay there to see

181
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,902
how impossible his dream is.

182
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,656
Dad, I really don't have to worry, right?

183
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,784
It's not just one subsidiary.

184
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,370
It's not easy to hand over
management rights.

185
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,456
-Damn it...
-The stockholders

186
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,250
won't let that senile old man

187
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,085
do what he wants.

188
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,879
He always does what he wants.

189
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,964
He even slapped me like this.

190
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,299
If you wait quietly,

191
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,426
everything will go to you.

192
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,180
So don't cause any more trouble
until then.

193
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,559
Right. Think about what you did
to survive until now.

194
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,186
What?

195
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,272
Remember why
my driver's license got suspended?

196
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,902
I took all the blame for you
when you were drunk driving.

197
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,862
Hey. Watch it.

198
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,199
If it weren't for that,
it would've been me!

199
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,784
I lost my chance!

200
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,910
-Hey!
-What?

201
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,828
-You little...
-Stop it!

202
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,875
Seung-a, just focus
on helping your brother.

203
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,253
Don't you see Ji-han

204
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:01,216
doing anything he can
to give LJ to his brother?

205
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,300
Hear that?

206
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,970
Listen to him.

207
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,764
Why are you so greedy?

208
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,020
Anyway, it's great
that he approved the marriage.

209
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:19,401
The stockholders' stance would've
been different if it was Chae-won.

210
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,949
What do you think?

211
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,451
Am I being too selfish?

212
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,371
No, you are not, sir.

213
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,166
But...

214
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,168
But what?

215
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,088
Do-han doesn't want it,

216
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,592
so I'm worried
that it'll be a tough fight.

217
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,388
Well...

218
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,683
Wouldn't Ji-han do well in leading

219
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,020
the company as well?

220
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,574
What? Despicable?

221
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,077
I'm not sure I'd fall
for someone so brazen and despicable.

222
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,333
Damn it.

223
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,794
Well, it's true I was dumbfounded
because of you,

224
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:20,879
but I don't

225
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,256
get butterflies.

226
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,350
The stockholders' meeting, right?

227
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:39,564
You always clean when you
have a lot on your mind.

228
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,691
Well, sort of.

229
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:48,073
To be honest, I was a little worried too.

230
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,828
I'm sure the stockholders will protest

231
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,459
if your brother ends up succeeding
the company when the chairman resigns.

232
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,294
No need to worry.

233
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,924
Do-han can get
someone powerful to support him.

234
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,052
Do you still think

235
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,012
he needs Ms. Yoon by his side?

236
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,555
Yes.

237
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,476
And I need your help.

238
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,690
Why is an angel... I mean,
why are you working here,

239
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,484
not at the cafe?

240
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,319
That's what I should ask.

241
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,364
Mr. Cold Iced Americano. Why are you here?

242
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,207
A-jung isn't here.
She's not doing this show anymore.

243
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,055
-This is cheating.
-Hey!

244
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,557
Stop!

245
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,641
Are you crazy?

246
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,978
Hey! Stop it!

247
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,146
Oh, my gosh.

248
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,273
Honey, are you okay?

249
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,357
Oh, no...

250
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,611
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

251
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,198
So why did you say you'd challenge her?

252
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm okay, honey.

253
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,203
And I'm a man,

254
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,497
-and she's...
-Oh, gosh.

255
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,874
Unbelievable.

256
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:26,629
Did you have to do this? You always
beat people up when you're upset.

257
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,095
Don't even talk about beating people up.

258
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,849
I'm feeling so complicated because of it.

259
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,310
Hey. You beat up my husband.

260
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,978
What is it this time?

261
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,647
You got the permission. Isn't that good?

262
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,732
It is.

263
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,778
But why did he give
his permission so easily?

264
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,615
Didn't you go there to get his permission?

265
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,742
You act like it was the opposite.

266
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,745
Right, I did.

267
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,582
But I'm just wondering
why he said yes so easily.

268
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,959
-How could you say that?
-What?

269
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,045
She must be crazy.

270
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,005
-Damn it.
-Honey.

271
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,466
BATTLE OF THE LJ SIBLINGS?

272
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,301
SEVEN DIRECTORS FIRED

273
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:18,431
So this woman really slapped
the little brother in front of you?

274
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,433
Yes, she did.

275
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,729
I was so shocked when he got hit.

276
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,481
She looks mean.

277
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,859
That alone showed what his family's like.

278
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,653
But

279
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,113
why do I feel sorry for that guy?

280
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,658
I mean,

281
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,454
it's already sad that his parents died,
but his half-siblings bully him

282
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,957
and his brother won't listen to him.

283
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,460
He must feel pretty lonely.

284
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,586
It's just...

285
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,671
Tae-min.

286
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,341
Don't make me
feel even more uncomfortable.

287
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,387
What? If you feel that uncomfortable,
be nice to him.

288
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,433
Right. Just seduce him
and get him on your side.

289
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,351
Come on.

290
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,644
I've made up my mind.

291
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,689
I'll seduce you and dump you.

292
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,568
Don't even say the word "seduce."

293
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,444
Just sew up my lips.

294
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,614
You say anything.
She hates everything I say.

295
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,747
How did he know we were talking about him?

296
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,416
Hello?

297
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,293
Where are you?

298
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,254
None of your business.

299
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,716
Is that an illness
that makes you unable to answer?

300
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,343
I'm not ill. I'm very healthy.

301
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,512
I was exercising near my home. Why?

302
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,597
Near your home?

303
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,515
Okay, then.

304
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,062
He's the one with an illness
that makes him hang up rudely.

305
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,315
A-jung.

306
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,691
Let's go eat.

307
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:56,112
Hearing your spicy story
makes me want spicy chicken feet.

308
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,447
-Let's go.
-Sure.

309
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,516
Get in.

310
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,310
Who are you?

311
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,360
You really seem to like

312
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,153
that coffee.

313
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,782
No, I'm just drinking it
because it's here.

314
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,326
But what is all this?

315
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,869
That outfit

316
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,371
and this car.

317
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:50,208
I wanted to remind you
that I'm from a wealthy family.

318
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,584
I already know that.

319
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,294
No, you don't seem to.

320
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,590
The male leads in the TV shows,
young, rich, tall, and handsome...

321
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,178
I'm that perfect character in real life.

322
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,390
It seems you don't realize that.

323
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,309
So you're doing all this to seduce me?

324
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,270
Enjoy it. Men like me
only exist in drama shows,

325
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,606
but you got lucky.

326
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,484
I wouldn't know.

327
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,487
I never got close to any male leads.

328
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,116
That's great.

329
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,078
Then I'm the first male lead in your life.

330
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,997
Enough with this nonsense.

331
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,665
Where are we going?

332
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,920
If you're taking me to some
construction site again, just let me off.

333
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,464
I'm all dressed and picked you up.

334
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,716
Isn't it obvious?

335
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,468
We're going on a date.

336
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,139
-Says who?
-You told me to try.

337
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:51,019
That you were curious. When you are,
you should experience it yourself.

338
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:53,896
Fine.

339
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,398
Go ahead, then.

340
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,526
You'll have to try it to give up too.

341
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,582
I bet you're often told

342
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,293
that you're ambitious.

343
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,297
Why are we going to Busan?

344
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,798
To watch a movie.

345
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,300
Going to Busan for that?

346
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,135
Wait.

347
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,220
Is it the film festival?

348
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,307
Really?

349
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,434
Get changed before we take off.

350
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,250
It's pretty.

351
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,839
By the way,

352
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,011
I've never been on a plane
that's so empty.

353
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,930
I booked the entire plane.

354
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,225
Sure. Right.

355
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,853
What movie are we seeing?

356
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,648
You have classic tastes.

357
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:23,027
But I don't get butterflies
just by watching a movie together.

358
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,697
There is some turbulence.

359
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,868
Please check
if you are wearing your seat belt again.

360
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,046
I was just surprised, that's all.

361
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,152
It was fortunate there was someone inside.

362
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,613
If you hadn't spotted it,
it could have led to a fire.

363
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:13,035
Short circuits are not visible,
so we usually find out when it's too late.

364
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,413
I left this place empty for a while.

365
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,124
I didn't even realize it.

366
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:23,671
Really? But it looked like
the cable was cut by someone.

367
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,173
Does someone

368
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,924
have a grudge against you?

369
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,596
I was just joking.

370
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,722
Have a nice day.

371
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,473
-Thank you.
-Bye.

372
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,168
"Old woman"?

373
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,502
That's what I said.

374
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,587
Hey!

375
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,925
If I'm an old woman,

376
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,594
you're a grandpa!

377
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,969
I can't believe I saw that
before it was released.

378
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:58,975
Wait.

379
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,854
How did you know
I liked Director Kwon Hui-ju?

380
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,650
Did you do a background check?

381
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,572
You did, right?

382
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,078
It's this way.

383
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:22,748
It's this way.

384
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,928
It's not here.

385
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,680
Let's go.

386
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:39,932
Let's go!

387
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,852
-Son!
-Director.

388
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,688
How are you?

389
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,772
Great.

390
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,444
What's going on?
Suddenly wanting to see my work?

391
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,655
By the way, who is this?

392
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,574
-Oh, I'm...
-Say hi.

393
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,201
She's my mother's friend.

394
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,329
Nice to meet you.

395
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,663
-Hello.
-Hello.

396
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,749
This is Na A-jung.

397
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,667
My favorite actress.

398
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,546
-You're an actress?
-Yes.

399
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,048
I'm sorry.

400
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,175
-I should've recognized you.
-It's okay.

401
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,261
I just played a lot of minor roles.

402
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,139
I really enjoyed your movie.

403
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,558
-Thank you.
-It was great.

404
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,726
Director.

405
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:25,770
Hey.

406
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,147
-Let's meet again.
-Yes.

407
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,399
I'll say hi to you next time.

408
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,317
Thank you.

409
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,401
Bye.

410
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,486
Bye.

411
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,204
Director Kwon Hui-ju!

412
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,707
I thought you wouldn't feel anything.

413
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,127
But you seem pretty excited.

414
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,965
But how do you know her?

415
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,385
She's your mom's friend?

416
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,431
I'm a huge fan of her.

417
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,517
Will it go on all day?

418
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,143
-Hi.
-Hello.

419
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,146
I'm not working with her anymore.

420
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,940
-Don't.
-She's so annoying.

421
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,151
Na A-jung?

422
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,074
It can't be her.

423
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,456
I haven't felt this way in ages.

424
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,167
You don't seem to like me.

425
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,712
This is a blind date,

426
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:35,631
but you already ate,

427
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,177
and you don't answer me properly.

428
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,058
We're both uncomfortable,
but I'm the only one...

429
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,107
making an effort here.

430
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,153
I'm sorry.

431
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,240
But I didn't know this was a blind date.

432
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,576
I have an important schedule, so...

433
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,660
Come on.

434
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,912
You're lying.

435
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,918
What's more important than marriage?

436
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,921
We're in the same situation.

437
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,343
My mother told me your schedule was empty.

438
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,597
You must've heard
my schedule was empty too.

439
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,764
I didn't.

440
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,017
I'm sorry.

441
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,646
I heard you did!

442
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,614
-Congrats.
-Congrats!

443
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,872
I oppose this marriage.

444
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,665
So choose.

445
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,250
Is it me or this?

446
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,170
Ji-han, get up. You'll ruin your clothes.

447
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,380
I'm here to stop your wedding.

448
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,426
You'll have to step on me
to walk the aisle.

449
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,556
Then I can't get married.
How could I step on you?

450
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:16,023
How can your family smile like that
when they're marrying off

451
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,651
their beautiful daughter?

452
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,531
You're really going to do this?

453
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,991
No regrets?

454
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,285
I won't.

455
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:29,787
Even if I do this?

456
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,791
All right, then.

457
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,293
I'll get a photo and go.

458
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,799
-Take a photo for us.
-Sure.

459
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:45,636
I can't wish you happiness
when you're not marrying Do-han.

460
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,931
I hope you're not happy.

461
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,308
How could you say that to a bride?

462
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,852
Fine, I'll take it back, then.

463
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,855
It's such a shame.

464
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,234
If I'd known,
I would've made a move on you.

465
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,864
I'll take that back too.

466
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,332
I must've lost my mind.

467
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,376
Missing those days.

468
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,007
Enjoy.

469
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,634
Nice try,

470
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,846
but I was excited
about meeting Director Kwon.

471
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,517
So let me make this clear.
I never got butterflies.

472
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,854
I'm the one who let you meet her,
so you should've.

473
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,939
If you're going to be like that,

474
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,232
I'm going back home.

475
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,363
So how's your cheek?

476
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,283
Are you pitying me?

477
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,786
You don't have to say it like that.

478
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,705
Keep pitying me.

479
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,374
They say pity leads to love.

480
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,753
So just pity me.

481
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,421
We saw a movie and ate.

482
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,797
Are we leaving now?

483
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:04,882
No.

484
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,801
We had dessert, so let's go get a meal.

485
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,268
Wait here, I'll be back soon.

486
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:26,111
Why did we even come here?

487
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,993
A-jung!

488
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,870
Hey, Na-ri.

489
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,624
You came to watch a movie?

490
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,293
I thought I saw you in the VIP lounge.

491
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,419
Oh, really?

492
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,755
You could've said hi.

493
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,132
Did you see my film? How was it?

494
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,301
You know...

495
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:53,472
I didn't think it would suit me,
so I turned it down three times.

496
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,057
But Director Kwon

497
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,102
was so intent on working with me,
so I said yes.

498
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,104
I liked it.

499
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,564
Your acting was good,

500
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,691
and the story

501
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,943
and directing was great.

502
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,445
That's a relief.

503
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,489
By the way,

504
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,617
where did you get that dress?

505
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,036
This?

506
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,372
I got it as a gift.

507
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:19,957
Why?

508
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,750
Oh, gosh.

509
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,211
Who gave that to you?

510
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:29,091
It's a copy of a dress that has only one
that's being sold in Korea.

511
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,678
Get rid of that dress.

512
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,473
I'll lend you mine.
Let's go to a party with me later.

513
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,517
-A party?
-It's a VIP party.

514
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,145
I thought you needed an invitation.

515
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,646
-Hey.
-Yes?

516
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,273
An invitation?

517
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,316
Hey.

518
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,319
A-jung's an actress too!

519
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,905
Are you saying an actress

520
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,866
who never got any major roles

521
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,493
can't even attend a party?

522
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,871
Apologize to her.

523
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,706
-No.
-I'm sorry.

524
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,166
It's okay.

525
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,292
What's with you?

526
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,711
Why are you being so harsh on her?

527
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,172
She was looking down on you.

528
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:14,136
You know how much
I hate discriminating in this field.

529
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,306
Lower your head.

530
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,766
Na-ri.

531
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,850
Na-ri.

532
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,268
What is it?

533
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,021
There must have been a mistake.

534
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,606
Your room's been changed.

535
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,442
Don't you know
I always stay in the suite room?

536
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,653
I came here for that room.

537
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,239
They sent an email about it. A VVIP came.

538
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,201
I'm sorry, I should've checked in advance.

539
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,328
So who's the VVIP?

540
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,372
Is it an actor? More famous than me?

541
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:47,044
What jerk takes
someone else's room like this?

542
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,837
I'm that jerk.

543
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,390
Let's go.

544
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,309
You...

545
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,187
And one more thing.

546
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,689
I'd like some info on someone.

547
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:09,942
Someone besides Ms. Na?

548
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,278
Hello! It's me, Na-ri.

549
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:17,407
They were classmates, but Ms. Na
used to be much more popular then.

550
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,494
But Ms. Hong Na-ri succeeded
after graduation.

551
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,913
It seems she got Ms. Na to play

552
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,582
minor roles in all her shows
and mocked her

553
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,960
perhaps because
of her inferiority complex.

554
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,212
Is it this?

555
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,885
I'll buy this.

556
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,389
I want to gift it to an actress I like.

557
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,017
But that product is the only one
sold in Korea.

558
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:47,980
It's all right.

559
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,440
He can buy it.

560
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,651
This way, please.

561
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,199
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

562
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,245
The gift.

563
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,497
I think you forgot.

564
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,833
I'll accept your gift.

565
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,961
It's not yours.

566
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,921
It's Hong Na-ri.

567
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,930
What happened?

568
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,892
Business class is empty.

569
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,227
I'm sure there weren't any seats left.

570
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:31,481
You mean someone booked them all
and didn't come?

571
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,317
Hello, everyone!

572
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,943
Guess where I am?

573
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,237
Shall we go inside? Let's go.

574
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,322
Come on!

575
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,001
Sorry, the shop is rented today,

576
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,045
so we can't take other customers.

577
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,089
Don't you know me?

578
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,174
Well...

579
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,842
Goodbye.

580
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,677
You can't just go.

581
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,597
How could you just go?

582
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:09,978
What the hell?

583
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,315
Hang on.

584
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,111
That guy...

585
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,323
This dress...

586
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:25,911
The dessert...

587
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,875
So annoying.

588
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:41,093
I'm going to expose you
on social media for this.

589
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,513
Do you know how many followers I have?

590
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,141
Do it. I'll expose you too.

591
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,856
You forced her to ride a horse

592
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,276
and made her get fired when she fell.

593
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,657
That has nothing to do with you.

594
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,741
Yes, it does.

595
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,706
Because Na A-jung is...

596
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,126
my heroine today.

597
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,337
Let's go.

598
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,222
Did you just clap?

599
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,976
So annoying.

600
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,020
You too.

601
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,035
Sit.

602
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,289
I'm sure one of these
will suit your taste.

603
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,250
What is all this?

604
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,379
Well, this despicable, shameless guy
is seducing you right now.

605
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,470
So? Didn't that feel nice?

606
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:10,223
Whenever Hong Na-ri comes to Busan,
she'll think of

607
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,269
your face and this day that I ruined.

608
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,105
So why did you do that?

609
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,982
And how did you know about us?

610
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,359
Did you really do a background check?

611
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,028
Yes, I did.

612
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,740
I can't make a fake confession of love

613
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,201
or throw myself at you.

614
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,120
So I got revenge for you.

615
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,916
The male leads in TV shows always do that.

616
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,335
They suddenly appear

617
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,004
and save you in a moment

618
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,672
of trouble.

619
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,013
Anyway, whichever room
Hong Na-ri is staying in,

620
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,477
we're above her. This is the top floor.

621
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,356
I'm not bragging,
but this is what I can do.

622
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,109
So?

623
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,986
Are you getting butterflies?

624
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,033
Did you just laugh?

625
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:15,038
Well, what kind of guy
gets revenge to win a girl's heart?

626
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,291
Every single one did
in the shows you were in.

627
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,210
I studied so hard.

628
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,380
Why don't we just go skydiving, then?

629
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,758
My heart would pound.
It might just explode.

630
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,009
That's next.

631
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,181
Stop.

632
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,183
Don't eat if it didn't work.

633
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,852
We leave in two hours.

634
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,478
We're not going anywhere.

635
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,857
This is expensive. I'm sleeping here.

636
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,734
And since you're splurging anyway,

637
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,736
order drinks too.

638
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,115
Then I might get butterflies.

639
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:02,836
Yes?

640
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:05,672
What?

641
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,883
Lee Ji-han's in Busan with a girl?

642
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,136
Keep watching and reporting to me.

643
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,637
Even if it gets late.

644
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,223
-Stay overnight.
-Check if they stay.

645
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,350
And how close they seem.

646
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,186
And how close they seem.

647
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:20,896
Yes.

648
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,523
Send the security footage.

649
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,740
This is going to be huge.

650
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,076
He wanted Chae-won for Do-han's wife.

651
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,703
Who would he date himself?

652
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,330
You're right.

653
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,332
Tell him to find out who she is.

654
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,416
Okay.

655
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,629
The reporter you mentioned, Kang Ik-jun.

656
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,965
I met him, but he said he had
nothing to tell you.

657
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,718
He says he'll only talk

658
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,553
to Chairman Hyun.

659
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,348
He's looking down on me too?

660
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,892
How dare he?

661
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,688
Fine.

662
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,650
Get him some sources he can write about.

663
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,028
And set a meeting again.
I'm going to see him myself.

664
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,072
Ji-han.

665
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,532
You're really not drinking?

666
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,952
Not with you.

667
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,828
I was going to

668
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,914
rethink my feelings

669
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:22,415
if you drank too.

670
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,005
That was a lie.

671
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,968
What the...

672
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,183
You know,

673
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,061
I kept thinking today,

674
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:49,234
"I haven't gotten any closer to my dream."

675
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,195
But what's funny

676
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,408
is that I really did my best.

677
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,452
I worked really hard,

678
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,958
devoting my time and pride to my dream.

679
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,460
I endured so much,

680
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,965
but I realized it didn't get me anywhere.

681
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,218
What was I even doing?

682
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:20,473
If I just give up everything,
will I be free from

683
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,600
all this regret?

684
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,736
You might become happy.

685
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,321
Right?

686
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,614
But you might not grow.

687
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,119
Having regrets is what helps people grow.

688
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,621
It makes them do better.

689
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,959
So don't let go

690
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:50,587
of your regrets.

691
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,344
I'm sure it will make you grow.

692
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,442
Hey.

693
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,944
You said you wouldn't drink with me.

694
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,989
And to be honest, I didn't like the movie.

695
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:22,285
Especially when Hong Na-ri was eating
after starving.

696
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:26,247
Your acting was much better
in the reenactment show.

697
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,332
Reenactment show?

698
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,837
You mean the scene where I ate canned tuna
when I was lost in the woods?

699
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:33,922
Yes.

700
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,884
And you eating leftover food
in the recent historical drama.

701
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,177
You did

702
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,721
much better than her.

703
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,891
You watched all of them?

704
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,476
Didn't I just tell you?

705
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,146
I watched all of them
to study the male leads.

706
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,357
See this?

707
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,983
My eyes are all red now.

708
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,078
You're the first

709
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,708
to have watched all my shows
apart from my parents.

710
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,671
You don't need

711
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,673
to feel so touched.

712
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,930
Ji-han, my hair dryer's broken. Where's...

713
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,855
He didn't come home?

714
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,325
Oh, my head.

715
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:07,075
It'll be a shame if he gets a scar.

716
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,339
Still appreciating the view?

717
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:24,884
Keep looking, then.

718
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,761
I'll let you.

719
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:29,430
We're late. Get up.

720
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,766
Isn't the flight at 12:00 p.m.?

721
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,844
We will be taking off soon.

722
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:11,848
Please check
if you've fastened your seat belts.

723
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,859
Ji-han, don't worry.

724
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,652
It's okay.

725
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,073
What do we do?

726
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,078
Ji-han, are you okay?

727
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,008
We're in the air.

728
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:51,846
It's okay now.

729
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,248
This is all your fault, sir.

730
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,417
My love life

731
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,381
is ruined now.
I was even treated like a two-timer.

732
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,341
If it's so easy to get ruined,

733
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,260
it's better not to start it.

734
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,099
Love isn't that easy, you know.

735
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,642
I can't help

736
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,978
moving toward that person

737
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,231
and looking at her.

738
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:47,276
All my focus is on her.

739
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,321
That's what happens

740
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:52,657
when you like someone.

741
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,409
That sounds like

742
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,828
you're a robot getting controlled.

743
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:03,167
When you really fall for someone,

744
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,294
you'll understand.

745
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,089
Enough about me.

746
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,218
Why do you look so down?

747
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,053
I don't. I'm totally fine.

748
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:15,888
No, you're not.

749
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:22,353
I can tell there's a lot on your mind.

750
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:27,567
Oh, I guess it's hard seducing Ms. Na.

751
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:31,946
I told you.

752
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,116
Winning someone's heart isn't easy.

753
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,495
How about making someone else do it?

754
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,205
Someone else?

755
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:46,335
If you want Ms. Na to change her mind,
it doesn't have to be you who seduces her.

756
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:50,381
She may be cautious towards you,

757
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,091
but Ms. Na could be

758
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:54,594
more open-hearted to other people.

759
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,014
Then it would be easier to seduce her.

760
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,863
LJ's the first to have
an extension on the exhibit.

761
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,990
I'll make sure you won't regret it.

762
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,116
Okay.

763
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,785
I'll get going, then.

764
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:30,755
Did you eat?

765
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,799
Of course. Look at the time.

766
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,342
What's this?

767
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,552
List of blind dates, from my father.

768
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:44,227
You're doing it?

769
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,436
Not if you say no.

770
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,521
Then don't.

771
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,022
There's still a chance.

772
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:52,235
Ji-han.

773
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,694
I need to talk to you.

774
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,404
Sure, go on.

775
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:56,614
Well, not here.

776
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,741
Somewhere nice.

777
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,535
How about Friday?

778
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,621
Sure.

779
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,833
If you don't need this, I'll take it.

780
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,045
He said yes,

781
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,631
-but we should register this first.
-Okay.

782
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,676
I filled mine. You just have to do this.

783
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,262
And

784
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,639
our tickets.

785
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,143
New York?

786
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,144
Yes.

787
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,063
So soon?

788
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,107
Grandpa's going to India then.

789
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,900
We should go when he's away.

790
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,237
Well, I don't object.

791
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,323
I was thinking of leaving with you anyway.

792
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,743
But there are things we should do first.

793
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:46,622
I've heard

794
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,708
a lot about you.

795
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,504
But A-jung just said
you were a close friend.

796
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:57,133
We didn't know who your family was either.

797
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,888
But when did you start dating?

798
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,265
-Three...
-Five years...

799
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,812
That's not important.

800
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,443
Right.

801
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,694
He's right.

802
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,574
What matters is
that you're getting married, right?

803
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,163
Thank you for giving us
your blessing when I lack a lot.

804
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,040
Nonsense.

805
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:32,418
A-jung's the one who lacks a lot.

806
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:38,007
We're just grateful
that you're marrying her.

807
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,675
Oh, gosh.

808
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,594
I should be grateful to her.

809
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,100
I really need A-jung.

810
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,019
Oh, how can you

811
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,730
be so sweet?

812
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:53,856
By the way,

813
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,858
do you have any siblings?

814
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,361
I have one little brother.

815
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:02,365
Your brother must be
handsome and nice too.

816
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,449
Right?

817
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:06,911
Have some.

818
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,037
Right.

819
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,090
He's right.

820
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,385
This will be better
than wasting my own time.

821
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,930
APPLICATION FOR MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

822
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:30,893
Wow, your boyfriend is really cool.

823
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,146
A registration
right after meeting the parents?

824
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,941
Didn't you go to Busan with him too?

825
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,569
Na-ri made a huge fuss about

826
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:43,990
how your splurging boyfriend
ruined her day.

827
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,077
Didn't I just tell you?

828
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:51,372
I watched all of them
to study the male leads.

829
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,208
See this? My eyes are all red now.

830
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,134
Come to TK Hotel's restaurant by 6:30 p.m.

831
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,136
I have something to tell you.

832
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,929
Wow, talk of the devil.

833
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,348
How did he know?

834
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:10,766
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

835
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,063
And he could just call.
Why does he always want to meet up?

836
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:17,481
Who?

837
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:21,318
Shouldn't he come to me
if he has something to say?

838
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,904
Does he think

839
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,323
I'll come and go

840
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,117
as he wants?

841
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,161
Who?

842
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,788
Someone annoying.

843
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,167
It'd better not be
something useless again.

844
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,253
Who are you talking about?

845
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,379
Who?

846
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:41,922
Who is this about?

847
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,674
-Who?
-I can't understand.

848
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,052
-Hello?
-Anyway,

849
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:47,803
I'm leaving.

850
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,138
-Now?
-Hey.

851
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,347
-Where?
-Where?

852
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,017
You were filling in
your registration form!

853
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,019
Thank you.

854
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,033
Ms. Na A-jung?

855
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,663
Hello. I'm Han Yeong-hun, your blind date.

856
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,718
What's on your mind?

857
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,345
Nothing.

858
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,723
What did you want to say?

859
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,600
Go on.

860
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,435
After we eat.

861
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,438
Do you want a drink too?

862
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:42,066
No thanks. I drank too much recently.

863
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,984
But you can drink.

864
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,069
It's fine.

865
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:47,655
I want to say it sober.

866
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,281
What?

867
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,075
What is it?

868
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,120
You're scaring me now.

869
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:55,412
Chae-won.

870
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:58,040
-What?
-Nice seeing you here.

871
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,583
-Here for a meal?
-Yes.

872
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,336
-Hey, Ji-han.
-Hello.

873
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,046
What's going on?

874
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,591
You sent someone
on your blind date to see him?

875
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:08,801
What do you mean?

876
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:09,885
My blind date?

877
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:11,512
I sent someone I know.

878
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,265
I heard he had a good personality.

879
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,641
What do you mean?

880
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,644
He bailed out since it wasn't Chae-won.

881
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,605
I don't know who you sent,
but if you're close,

882
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,357
you should call her.

883
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,734
You know Yeong-hun's a douche.

884
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,279
Hey.

885
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,405
Coming.

886
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,323
Anyway, enjoy your meal.

887
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:32,575
See you next time.

888
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,290
Who did you send instead of me?

889
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,625
What?

890
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,544
Well...

891
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:44,712
It's nothing.

892
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,303
I think I should go.

893
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:54,638
Let's talk later.

894
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,723
I'm really sorry.

895
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:56,807
What?

896
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,809
Ji-han!

897
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,604
The person you are calling is...

898
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,105
Damn it.

899
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,280
The person you...

900
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,536
So how's your cheek?

901
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,998
You're the first

902
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:26,045
to have watched all my shows
apart from my parents.

903
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,923
We're in the air.

904
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,425
It's okay now.

905
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,274
Get in. I'll drive you.

906
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:57,743
I'm sorry.

907
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,539
Sorry.

908
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:35,114
JEONGAK DISTRICT OFFICE

909
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,700
NA A-JUNG

910
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,956
The person you are calling...

911
00:59:58,846 --> 00:59:59,847
Well...

912
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,849
I should get going now.

913
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,435
As I told you,

914
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,771
I didn't know this was a blind date.

915
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,441
What did you expect, then?

916
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:15,446
Ji-han?

917
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,408
That's not important.

918
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,451
I'm curious.

919
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:25,414
Who are you, and why did Ji-han
send you to a blind date?

920
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:27,541
I'm...

921
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,919
curious too.

922
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,756
I thought we were friends.

923
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:37,593
Ji-han's a really upright guy
among us friends.

924
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,180
He never drinks outside

925
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,640
or even hangs out with us.

926
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:47,227
He says guys are
bound to cause trouble together.

927
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,521
He's always so careful.

928
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,148
I've never seen him meet

929
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,525
any girl besides Chae-won.

930
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:56,528
So I want to learn more about you.

931
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,031
Can't I do that?

932
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:00,574
You can.

933
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,658
Cheers.

934
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:13,754
Are you mad?

935
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:16,965
Why would you come here?

936
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:23,055
Well, then.

937
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:24,723
Shall we go?

938
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,433
Okay.

939
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:30,521
I have other plans,
so I should get going anyway.

940
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,106
Go where?

941
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,190
I meant,

942
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,150
going upstairs.

943
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,235
To our room.

944
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:37,569
What?

945
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:40,030
I said I wanted to learn about you.

946
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,158
Show me how you seduced Ji-han.

947
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:44,910
I'll be just as good...

948
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,917
What do you think you're doing?

949
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:58,257
I always wondered why people splashed
expensive drinks on people's faces.

950
01:01:58,757 --> 01:01:59,800
I get it now.

951
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,136
Keep it down and sit down.

952
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,512
Don't order me.

953
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,473
You're not my boss

954
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,101
or my parents.

955
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,524
If you go now, I could spread rumors

956
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:22,322
about Ji-han paying an actress
to sleep with him.

957
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,578
Then everyone will be curious.

958
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:29,538
Right.

959
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,582
Trying to set me up with you?

960
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,043
Does he want me to become like his mom?

961
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,045
Drink.

962
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,173
Unless you want that parasite

963
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,800
to crumble from weird rumors.

964
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:50,350
Yes, it's polite to finish your drink.

965
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,645
You're really desperate.

966
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,023
Fine.

967
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,983
You're being really clingy,

968
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,359
so I'll drink it.

969
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,611
Clingy?

970
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,778
I sat,

971
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,864
and I'll be polite.

972
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,074
So keep your word.

973
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,284
Keep my word?

974
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,577
If I drink this,

975
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,916
you'd better shut that mouth
about Ji-han, okay?

976
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:40,359
I finished it, so she can go, right?

977
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,250
A-jung, why can't I reach you?

978
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,419
The district office closed,
so I'm at my studio now.

979
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,796
Call me back.

980
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,758
I'm worried that something's happened.

981
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,554
Message recorded.

982
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,826
Mr. Kim, can I ask a favor?

983
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,038
Could I get footage
from the security camera near my studio?

984
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:38,041
Yes, everyone who came here.

985
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,126
Lee Do-han.

986
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,516
It really is you.

987
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:58,020
How have you been?

988
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,360
Don't follow me. I'm pissed.

989
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,072
Give me my bag.

990
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,035
I'm sorry, don't be pissed.

991
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:16,538
About what?

992
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:20,709
Do you know what you did wrong?

993
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,337
I tried to set you up with someone else.

994
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,922
It was someone decent.

995
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,050
The point isn't whether

996
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,636
someone decent or not came as a date.

997
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:34,806
You heard him,

998
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,226
but why didn't you do anything?

999
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,979
You always say harsh things to me,

1000
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:44,232
but why did you
just listen to all that crap?

1001
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:46,693
Can't you talk?

1002
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:49,237
Of course I can.

1003
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:52,866
See? You talk back to me all the time.

1004
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,202
Why didn't you talk back to him?

1005
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:58,497
Are you

1006
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,792
angry because of that?

1007
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,544
Not because I sent you on a blind date?

1008
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,213
You know,

1009
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:09,299
I don't care what strangers say.

1010
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,260
I won't see them again anyway.

1011
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:15,764
I ate delicious food
and got expensive drinks for free.

1012
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,643
There was no loss for me.
But it's different for you.

1013
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,562
Why do you keep

1014
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,940
getting hurt in front of me?

1015
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,735
Your cheek and that jerk's words.

1016
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,530
You're making me feel sorry.

1017
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,533
You don't get butterflies.

1018
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,618
You just feel sorry?

1019
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,705
You're really going on about that?

1020
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:40,914
I'm angry too.

1021
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,459
Because you were insulted.

1022
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:49,548
That's a surprise.

1023
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,718
Getting angry because of me?

1024
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:56,304
I thought you hated me the most.

1025
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:59,433
I guess I like you, then.

1026
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,110
I like you enough to get angry

1027
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,446
if someone...

1028
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,117
insults you.

1029
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:38,805
Ji-han.

1030
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,517
Ji-han.

1031
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:04,539
Ji-han.

1032
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,157
Let go of me!

1033
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:41,451
I was stupid to be grateful for you.

1034
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,579
This is kidnapping, you know.

1035
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:47,624
I recorded everything, just in case.

1036
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,543
Give it to me.

1037
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,712
If you can't be reached, it's a breach...

1038
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:57,634
Investigate the girl my brother's seeing.

1039
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,553
I'm leaving with A-jung.

1040
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,931
Just keep an eye on us.
I'll be really good to Do-han.

1041
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,683
My heart's pounding.

1042
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:06,560
Regardless of my will.
