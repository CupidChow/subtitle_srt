1
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,892
DIPLOMA

2
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,065
It's here.

3
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,443
Here's your food.

4
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:10,654
Kaoliang liquor.

5
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,825
ID CARD

6
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,495
-Oh, okay. Just a minute.
-Okay.

7
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,924
It's burning!

8
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,972
I told you I wanted soda.

9
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,891
Soda isn't cool.

10
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,895
I wanted to try this.
Drinking after a breakup.

11
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,772
It was a fake relationship.

12
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,898
Fake?

13
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,027
Hey, it was still my first relationship.
So just play along.

14
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,530
I told you we should pretend to break up.

15
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,531
What? Pretend?

16
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,116
You're the one who wanted to

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,953
sit together for our school trip.

18
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,580
Right, but then you said
we couldn't break up

19
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,749
because you had to copy my homework.

20
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,667
Right.

21
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,919
Why didn't I know

22
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,506
that it was easy
to pretend to date your bestie

23
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,758
but hard to pretend to break up?

24
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:20,850
So do you regret protecting me
in front of those kids two years ago?

25
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,355
I mean,
you could've gotten a crush on someone.

26
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,148
I don't regret it.

27
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,277
Friendship is more important to me.

28
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,614
You just haven't found your true love yet.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,074
Maybe.

30
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,036
But right now, you're more important.

31
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,081
So you can feel touched.

32
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,542
You're like my little brother.

33
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,502
Hey, how dare you.

34
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,504
I mean my real brother.

35
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,215
He said something similar.

36
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,845
He wanted to come to my graduation.
He said I'm the most important to him.

37
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,515
I barely convinced him not to ditch
a big competition for me.

38
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,475
How caring.

39
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,978
You're really lucky.

40
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,106
You have two guardians to protect you.

41
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:10,900
Right.

42
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,068
I'm really grateful.

43
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,779
Let's eat.

44
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,327
That's when I decided

45
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,247
that I'd protect
my one and only friend A-jung

46
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,708
and my one and only family Ji-han

47
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,960
no matter what happened.

48
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,967
And as that resolution's broken today,
I think back on the past.

49
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,511
When

50
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,806
did things start to go wrong?

51
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,865
Since when?

52
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,995
Was that after Ji-han found out I'm gay?

53
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,377
Ji-han knows what?

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,755
Then you two started...

55
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,759
seeing each other when he didn't even know

56
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,221
that this was fake?

57
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,681
What do you mean?

58
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,445
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,616
"Fake"?

60
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,369
Ji...

61
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:47,997
Ji-han.

62
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,670
Maybe it was

63
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,506
an impossible resolution.

64
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,051
Protecting someone means

65
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,305
confronting problems without running away.

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,521
But all I've done my entire life
is run away from things.

67
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,528
Ji-han.

68
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,990
Ji-han!

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,953
-Let's talk--
-About what?

70
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,164
Is there anything for me to say?

71
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:31,707
I...

72
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,459
Or for you to say?

73
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,090
So...

74
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,345
you knew from the beginning
that he was gay,

75
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,225
and you were
going to fake a marriage to hide it.

76
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,728
But you kept that from me.

77
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,272
Isn't that all?

78
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,608
Is there something I missed?

79
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,487
Ji-han, I...

80
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,199
-I had my reasons--
-You should've told me.

81
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,118
When were you going to tell me?

82
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,038
You made me a pathetic fool.

83
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,085
We promised

84
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,546
not to hide anything
from each other again.

85
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,132
Was that a lie?

86
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,972
-It's not that...
-When did you tell Do-han?

87
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,977
The day I asked you to trust me

88
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,438
and wait for me?

89
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,947
That would've been better.

90
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,659
We're not done talking.

91
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,745
I was deceived by you too.

92
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,207
No, I was fooled even more.
You're one to talk right now.

93
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,882
Seung-a came to see me.

94
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,470
She doesn't know my secret yet,
but she'll find out soon enough

95
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:12,558
since the reporter talked to Dae-hyeon.
So you can't do this.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,643
It'll make things worse.

97
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,522
I'm barely managing to stop myself
from running away right now.

98
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,441
I really don't know...

99
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,488
what I'm supposed to do right now.

100
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,579
-Ji-han.
-Don't go.

101
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,020
We're still getting married.

102
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,189
Do-han.

103
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,567
If you really think of me as your friend,

104
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,236
then you'd rethink this, just once.

105
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,946
You should.

106
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't you think?

107
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,794
EPISODE 10

108
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,216
Come and have breakfast!

109
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,884
Okay!

110
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,934
A-jung! You almost made me
faint from shock.

111
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,518
What are you doing here?

112
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,729
What?

113
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,775
A-jung? Are you acting or something?

114
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,110
-Come have breakfast.
-Okay.

115
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,280
You never come at once.

116
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,865
-I'm sorry.
-Later.

117
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,785
If you eat later,
that'll be lunch or dinner.

118
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,289
What's going on with you these days?

119
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,375
You're not eating at all.

120
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,676
What? It's Do-han.

121
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:12,844
Why would he...

122
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,516
You should've joined us for breakfast.
I set the table.

123
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,685
It's okay. I came without calling.

124
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,353
Please invite me next time.

125
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,313
Sure.

126
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,360
Will you be back late today, then?

127
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,489
Yes, there are a lot of things to prepare.

128
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,326
We need to look for a house,
furniture, and appliances too.

129
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,244
Right.

130
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,415
I'm sorry I'm so busy
when the wedding's soon.

131
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,499
No, it's fine.

132
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,008
See you later.

133
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,009
Okay.

134
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,348
What's with her?

135
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,267
Something seems up with her.

136
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,769
She's not eating

137
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,354
or sleeping properly.

138
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,898
I'll make sure to cheer her up today.

139
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,483
Sounds great.

140
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,485
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay.

141
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,737
Bye.

142
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,238
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

143
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,531
-Have fun.
-Bye.

144
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,542
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,169
About what?

146
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,381
I didn't get to tell you yesterday--

147
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,843
Oh, right. About our house.
It'll be best to get one

148
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,428
near your house, right?

149
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,555
Do-han.

150
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,641
-Oh, and the marriage registration--
-Lee Do-han!

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,197
Can't you see I'm making an effort?

152
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,531
I can.

153
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,493
So it hurts more.

154
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,834
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

155
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,045
I'm really sorry.

156
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,255
I didn't want to go this far.

157
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,469
I tried to hold myself back,
but I just couldn't.

158
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,181
I like Ji-han too much to do this.

159
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,475
Do-han.

160
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,772
I know this sounds crazy,
and I know I'm being shameless,

161
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,025
but can't you just call it off?

162
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,200
If you continue like this,
I have no other choice.

163
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,662
Let's go to New York.

164
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,456
-What?
-Forget the wedding.

165
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,625
Let's go to New York as we planned.

166
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,252
How could you--

167
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,003
How could you do this to me?

168
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,298
Don't you know
how I felt when I asked you to marry me?

169
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,592
I was so desperate, A-jung.

170
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,389
I wanted to hide my secret
and be able to breathe.

171
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,271
I'm not the only one who'll suffer
if it gets out.

172
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,233
Are you okay
with your parents finding out?

173
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,195
Isn't that why you couldn't say anything?

174
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,532
I'm asking you...

175
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,873
Never mind.

176
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,003
I understand your reaction.

177
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,424
I'll do whatever it takes

178
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,802
to repay you for what I did.

179
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,514
But I can't do this anymore.

180
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:10,123

00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,192
Why are you avoiding me?

185
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,363
Did you come all the way here

186
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,532
to ask me that?

187
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,660
-I was impatient.
-Too impatient.

188
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,829
I need more time.

189
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,460
I can't bring myself to face you

190
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,420
like before.

191
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,717
Are you saying you won't see me anymore?

192
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:07,806
Ji-han!

193
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,641
I...

194
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,689
I can't trust you anymore.

195
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,441
You knew how I felt

196
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,945
and what I gave up to be with you.

197
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,283
I gave up Do-han,
who was everything to me.

198
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,576
But

199
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,744
it was different for you.

200
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,999
At first it was Do-han, then it was you.

201
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,295
Do you know how I felt each time?

202
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,965
I risked everything,

203
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,594
but I felt like it was all in vain.

204
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,639
I'm scared...

205
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,812
that I'll find out other secrets
and get hurt again.

206
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,523
Do you really

207
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,483
want to end--

208
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,943
I should go now.

209
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,624
How could he do this?

210
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,877
How could he?

211
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,339
Just go now.

212
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,967
How can I leave you, Ji-ae?

213
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,427
Why are you so pretty?

214
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh, stop.

215
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:33,266
But still, you just got off work.
I don't want you to be tired tomorrow.

216
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,146
Ji-ae, you're the most important to me.

217
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,358
You're so cool.

218
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,026
You're so sweet!

219
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,739
How are they able to
understand each other talking like that?

220
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,251
By the way, A-jung, is something up?
You're showing no reaction to them.

221
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,380
-Jong-hee.
-Yes?

222
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,131
Want to have a drink tonight?

223
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,717
I feel kind of sick today...

224
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,605
Hello?

225
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,440
It's Yoon Chae-won.

226
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,945
Right. Hello.

227
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,035
You really came.

228
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,121
Yes.

229
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,876
I heard from Ji-han.

230
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,421
So he has feelings for you?

231
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,678
I hate getting involved in these messes,

232
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,306
so I wanted to get over Ji-han,

233
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,225
but it's difficult.

234
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,395
So I came here to make sure.

235
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,734
Do you feel the same way for Ji-han?

236
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,070
Yes.

237
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,030
And I can't dissuade you?

238
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:12,991
No.

239
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,747
You didn't hesitate at all. How shameless.

240
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,666
No wonder it's come to this.

241
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,629
I care about Ji-han a lot.

242
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,339
What about Do-han, then?

243
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,550
Didn't you care about Do-han too?

244
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,428
I still care about him.

245
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,640
I'm going to protect him.

246
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:39,851
What?

247
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,353
I'm sorry,

248
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,024
but I have so much on my mind,
so I'll drink first.

249
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:05,835
What?

250
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,589
So you're not in touch with Ji-han now?

251
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,299
No. I mean,

252
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,968
I contact him,

253
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,887
but he doesn't.

254
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,599
He's not ignoring me,

255
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,937
but he's a little cold.

256
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,439
Just a little.

257
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,566
That's all.

258
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,026
Then...

259
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,447
Then I should've gone
to Ji-han, not to you.

260
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,199
Why would you go to him?

261
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,910
I should look for my chance.

262
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,538
There's no chance.

263
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,583
We're just keeping a distance
for a brief moment.

264
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,172
You don't believe me?

265
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,094
Even if Ji-han lets go of me,

266
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,179
I won't let go of him.

267
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,433
I'm going to stay right next to him.

268
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,103
Even if you lose everything?

269
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,398
You know,

270
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,360
it's easy for me.
All I have to lose is my pride.

271
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,240
But you'll lose everything
if you date him.

272
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,492
But you still want him?

273
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,245
Yes.

274
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,917
What does it mean to lose everything?

275
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm not sure.

276
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,133
But whatever happens,

277
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,136
it'll be better than losing Ji-han.

278
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,639
I'm already in so much pain.

279
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,310
I'll be able to breathe if I lose

280
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,646
everything else but him.

281
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,194
Jeez. That was so cheesy I sobered up.

282
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,744
Give me one too!

283
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,121
Get one yourself.

284
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,083
Don't expect me to feed one to you
and become your friend.

285
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,419
I'm not so easy, you know.

286
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:18,009
I'm really sorry, but I have no intention
of becoming your friend too.

287
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,220
You're Ji-han's first love.

288
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,141
It bothers me, you know.

289
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,143
So us being friends?

290
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,564
That's nonsense.

291
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,567
Just drink up.

292
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,539
It tastes good.

293
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,334
And the alcohol is good.

294
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,795
But my mood isn't.

295
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,592
I didn't expect you to come.

296
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,433
We still have to talk.

297
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,186
Did you meet A-jung today?

298
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,646
What if I did?

299
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,526
And you'll keep seeing her?

300
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,281
For the first time,

301
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,201
I was ashamed of you.

302
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,830
Not because you're gay,

303
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,917
but because you used someone to hide it.

304
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,798
I told you, A-jung and I agreed on it.

305
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,217
You shouldn't have gotten her involved

306
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,886
if you really cared for her.

307
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,306
I'm telling you again,
I can't end this marriage.

308
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,307
End it.

309
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,976
-No.
-Just end it.

310
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:55,231
You don't need to reveal it was fake.
You can just break it off, Do-han.

311
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,110
-I'll keep your secret.
-And you date her?

312
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,488
Everyone will point fingers at her.
You really want that?

313
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,700
She doesn't want to marry you.

314
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,910
So stop using her.

315
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,623
Seung-a found out. I'm already anxious
about it getting revealed.

316
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,000
That won't happen.

317
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,547
What are you thinking?

318
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,008
I won't tell you to take over the company,

319
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,634
so let A-jung go.

320
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,223
Let's live our own lives.

321
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,645
I'm done here, so I'm leaving.

322
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,839
NA A-JUNG

323
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,523
I said, we'll talk later.

324
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,650
I can't fold the paper cranes.

325
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,567
What?

326
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,569
They won't fold.

327
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,822
The paper cranes!

328
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,452
Are you drunk right now?

329
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,496
No, I'm not.

330
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,666
I'm wasted!

331
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,252
Where are you?

332
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,091
The person you are...

333
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,902
Why did you come all the way here?

334
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,029
Never mind.

335
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,701
What is that?

336
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,161
Oh, right.

337
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:14,787
A paper crane.

338
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,167
I wanted to make a wish too.

339
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,086
But it was too difficult,

340
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,089
so I only managed

341
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,799
to fold one.

342
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,386
When do I fold all 1,000?

343
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,390
What a lame paper crane.

344
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,311
What did you want to wish for?

345
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,482
Me forgiving you? Something like that?

346
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,151
No.

347
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,779
For you not to feel hurt.

348
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,327
And for all your scars to heal.

349
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,372
I didn't know.

350
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,835
I really didn't know you'd feel so hurt.

351
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,506
If I told you our marriage was fake,

352
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,384
I'd be telling you Do-han's secret.

353
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,471
But I couldn't do that.

354
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,516
So I met Do-han that day

355
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,602
because I wanted to be honest.

356
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,105
I didn't mean to deceive you.

357
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:29,153
By the way,
does folding paper cranes actually work?

358
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,530
No.

359
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,702
No?

360
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,080
No. It's impossible.

361
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,129
What do I do?

362
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,674
What about Ji-han?

363
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,302
What do I do about him?

364
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,180
-Ji-han...
-It works.

365
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,224
Folding them works.

366
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,981
It works?

367
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,568
That's a relief.

368
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,779
Then

369
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,074
I should fold thousands of them for him.

370
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,048
She seriously seduced me with this?

371
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,092
A napkin crane?

372
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,848
Wait for me.

373
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,648
Is it really you?

374
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,859
Be grateful it's really me.

375
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,073
What?

376
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,536
I thought you wanted to see me.
I guess I was wrong.

377
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,581
I...

378
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,543
You said you didn't want to see me.

379
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:56,258
Well...

380
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,889
I just didn't know how to treat you.

381
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,354
I wanted to hate you,
but I felt sorry for you.

382
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,981
And I wanted to push you away,

383
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,235
but I wanted to hug you.

384
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,279
What am I supposed to do?

385
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,701
Let's go and eat.

386
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,621
Wait.

387
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,044
There's something

388
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,797
I wanted to tell you.

389
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,844
I didn't mean to keep deceiving you.

390
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,350
What I really want to say is...

391
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,060
I...

392
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,359
I'm sorry.

393
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,945
I was afraid of getting hurt

394
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,114
and didn't think about you

395
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,283
getting hurt.

396
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,452
But I was

397
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,079
actually relieved

398
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,292
that you didn't have feelings for Do-han

399
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,128
and that he didn't deceive you.

400
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,590
I was so relieved.

401
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,092
That's how I felt.

402
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,345
I thought you hated me now.

403
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,896
I fell in love with my sister-in-law.
Why not a fraud?

404
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,070
Whatever happens,

405
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,199
I won't let go of you first.

406
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,244
I already tried it many times,

407
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,997
but I always failed.

408
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,128
I'm so sorry.

409
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,340
I'm sorrier.

410
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,802
I promise it won't happen again.

411
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,096
I swear it.

412
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,280
-Are you home now?
-Yes.

413
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:24,615
I'm home.

414
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,783
That took a while.

415
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,827
No, I arrived sooner,

416
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,621
but I ran into my dad.

417
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,082
He started scolding me

418
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,626
about staying out too often these days.

419
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,548
Right, I should talk to your parents too.

420
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,425
No, not yet.

421
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,428
I haven't talked to Do-han yet.

422
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,598
We should do that afterward.

423
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:50,683
All right.

424
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,852
Get some rest now. I'll call you later.

425
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,242
Did you make up with Do-han?

426
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,412
It can't be over already.

427
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,038
I have to stop it first.

428
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,667
Can you even stop it?

429
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,174
How can you date your sister-in-law?

430
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,519
I'm asking you,

431
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,812
don't touch Do-han

432
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:38,856
or A-jung.

433
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,940
Why shouldn't I?

434
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,401
This is just getting fun.

435
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,364
Don't you want the company?
No good will come from releasing this.

436
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,367
Stock prices will plummet,

437
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,788
and even without us,
Grandpa won't give you anything.

438
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,957
What do I gain from keeping quiet?

439
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,169
Do-han and I

440
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:01,837
will step down.

441
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:07,217
You know Do-han was
never interested in LJ anyway.

442
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,845
You'll get the company

443
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,972
without any scandals.

444
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,184
It's a tempting offer,
but I'm not that compelled.

445
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,521
You seem to be patronizing me
and trying to negotiate.

446
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,523
Know your place.

447
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,901
I'm not.

448
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,236
Then?

449
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,696
I'm begging you.

450
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,531
Desperately.

451
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,700
That's your way of begging?

452
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:52,846
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,392
I was ungrateful for you

454
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,519
taking me in.

455
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,981
I promise

456
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,775
I'll live quietly.

457
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,735
I'll stay

458
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,362
out of your sight.

459
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,038
Hey.

460
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,041
You've finally matured.

461
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,712
You should've known it from the beginning.

462
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,047
I understand.

463
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,801
You just didn't receive
a proper education at home.

464
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,595
I'll think about it positively.

465
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,515
Now, get up and leave.

466
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:41,353
I like seeing this,
but you said you'd stay out of my sight.

467
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:45,023
You should keep your word. All right?

468
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,110
So get up and go.

469
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,496
-Ms. Choi.
-Oh, hi.

470
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,581
Where's Grandpa?

471
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,417
He's talking with Mr. Kim in his study.

472
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,334
Okay.

473
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,675
Ms. Choi seems

474
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,095
to be in contact with Kang Ik-jun.

475
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,224
What?

476
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,809
I'm not sure why,

477
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,647
but she's been looking
into the late Ms. Hyun's accident.

478
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,108
She really...

479
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,282
Sir.

480
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:40,537
How about consoling her
by giving her some of the shares?

481
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,497
No.

482
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,793
A large number of the board
is already on Ms. Choi's side--

483
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,085
I said no!

484
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:48,670
Why not?

485
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,884
Why can't it be me?

486
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:05,771
Grandpa.

487
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,526
Have you been spying on me?

488
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,654
Why are you doing this to me?

489
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,364
Then let me ask you this.

490
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,451
What were you doing with that reporter?

491
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,037
What are you scheming?

492
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,706
What are you digging around for?

493
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,376
Didn't I make it clear?

494
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,379
Stop digging into Do-han, Ji-han,
and your mother.

495
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,589
Because you won't tell me properly.

496
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,552
Why are you hiding it from me?

497
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,762
It's my mom!

498
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,181
What are you so afraid of?

499
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,229
Grandpa.

500
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,566
I'm not going to

501
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,195
just let them
steal everything from me anymore.

502
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:58,782
"Steal"?

503
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,827
Do you think LJ was yours?

504
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,329
All right.

505
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,667
You're blinded by greed.

506
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,461
I'm not giving you any more chances.

507
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,130
Understand?

508
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,303
I'm never giving you the company,

509
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:21,930
so go.

510
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,474
Fine.

511
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,738
Did I even have a real chance?

512
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,866
The results would've been the same,

513
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,784
no matter what I or they did.

514
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,799
Yes, Mr. Kang.

515
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,260
It's me.

519
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,732
Enjoy.

520
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,949
She was totally staring.

521
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:24,952
Hey,

522
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:28,580
they're whispering about us, right?

523
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,918
Excuse me,

524
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,963
are you in the TV show
that started recently?

525
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,006
What was the title?

526
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,509
The role of an independence fighter.

527
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,843
That's right.

528
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,763
-She's my friend.
-Do you want an autograph?

529
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,140
Give her a freebie.

530
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,517
Unbelievable.

531
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,143
How shameless.

532
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,770
Ji-ae! A-jung!

533
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,398
Look at this.

00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,382
Is she crazy?
An affair with her brother-in-law?

538
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,925
I feel sorry for the brother.

539

Who is that woman?

540
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,347
I saw she got a role through connections.
It must've been them.

541

-She's crazy.
-Is this for real?

00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,878
and no one else.

552
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,255
Calling me a femme fatale,

553
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,257
a maneater,

554
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,593
a bitch who seduced two brothers.

555
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,846
If it were a different scandal,

556
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,267
I would've been furious and cursed

557
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,686
about how tough life is.

558
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,231
But I'm kind of relieved right now.

559
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,069
I should go.

560
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,361
Go where?

561
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,404
Home.

562
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,037
Wait.

563
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,165
Then this is all true?

564
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:40,128
So, A-jung is seeing her brother-in-law?

565
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,548
What the hell is he doing?

566
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:47,135
What the hell is all this?

567
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,806
What have you done
that there are trashy articles like this?

568
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,474
Tell me.

569
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,565
I thought I could finally relax a little,

570
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,653
but you cause such a dirty scandal?

571
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,491
What are you doing?

572
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,493
Hurry up and go.

573
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,246
Prepare a press release

574
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,456
saying the rumors are false!

575
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,333
Go! Hurry, you fool!

576
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,543
I can't do that.

577
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,920
-What?
-It's true.

578
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,005
I like A-jung.

579
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,217
I don't want to deny the truth.

580
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,601
Do you even know what you're saying?

581
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,147
Then what will you do about your brother?

582
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,191
You're the one
who agreed to the marriage first!

583
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,152
-What's with you?
-Grandpa.

584
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,738
I thought I'd been
always living for my brother.

585
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,448
What?

586
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,201
I told Do-han to take over LJ
and get married,

587
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,204
thinking it was for his sake. But...

588
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,211
I finally realized

589
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:05,630
that it wasn't.

590
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,428
It was just my own greed.

591
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,764
Right.

592
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,349
Anyway, it was my choice.

593
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,812
I'll take responsibility for it.

594
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,202
Ms. Na, if you're inside, please answer.

595
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,204
-Answer us.
-Give us a comment.

596
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,331
Is it true you're dating him?

597
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,461
This is much worse than last time.

598
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:50,383
Tell Su-jung
to leave Ji-oh at his aunt's, and...

599
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:55,931
No, just tell her to stay there.
She won't be able to come in anyway.

600
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,224
Okay.

601
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,392
I can't believe this!

602
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,521
A-jung, have you heard from your in-laws?

603
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,234
Cat got your tongue?

604
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,612
Call them or something.

605
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,157
You're involved in another scandal
because of their family.

606
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,952
And this time, it's total nonsense.

607
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,579
You're suffering
because of a fake scandal.

608
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:25,335
God... That AI or deepfake or whatever

609
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,255
is really scary, isn't it?

610
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:29,923
It looks so real.

611
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,049
Look.

612
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,593
But the background...

613
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,221
It looks like that playground nearby.

614
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,640
-What?
-Anyone would believe

615
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,059
this to be real...

616
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,186
Sorry.

617
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,480
A-jung.

618
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,441
Aren't you going to call them?

619
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,068
Should I do it?

620
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,115
It's all true.

621
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,204
Everything's true.

622
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,250
I like him.

623
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,252
What are you talking about?

624
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,839
Do-han came a few days ago
and took you on a date.

625
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:14,342
I talked it over with Do-han,
and we're breaking it off.

626
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:17,137
A-jung. Stop joking.

627
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:18,596
Is this...

628
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,933
really true?

629
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:23,893
Yes.

630
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,482
-Mother.
-Honey!

631
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,526
-Have you gone mad?
-Honey.

632
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,950
How could you cheat on him
before the wedding?

633
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,078
And with your brother-in-law?

634
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,623
-How could you do that?
-Stop it!

635
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,500
Stop! You'll really hurt her.

636
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,711
-Honey, stop!
-Get a grip!

637
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,589
Go! I don't want to see you!

638
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,050
Honey, calm down. Stop.

639
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,111
How dare you come here?

640
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,659
Are you crazy?

641
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:25,413
If you come here, you'd be admitting
that the scandal's true.

642
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,249
I'm sorry.

643
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,794
I didn't know it'd get this bad.

644
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,674
How is A-jung?

645
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:38,927
A-jung?

646
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,554
You're asking if she's okay?

647
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,307
Do you really think she'd be okay?

648
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,436
She cried.

649
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,605
She cried because of you!

650
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:55,610
I don't know how amazing your love is,

651
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,696
but is it worth
ruining each other's lives?

652
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,493
I'll give up everything.

653
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,372
I can do that.

654
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,583
Then give up A-jung.

655
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,211
That's the best thing

656
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,214
you can do for her.

657
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:38,820
I feel responsible
for my brother's mistake.

658
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,531
I apologize to everyone who was hurt

659
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,825
by this scandal.

660
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,743
-So fake.
-But

661
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:50,623
I want to emphasize that the incident
is completely unrelated to LJ.

662
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,710
So this is what she meant
by watching the fun.

663
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:59,215
Isn't she genius? Is she really my sister?
We're so different.

664
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,176
Honey!

665
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,512
Don't be happy about this.

666
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,266
We just sided with Ji-han
and Yoon Chae-won.

667
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,436
But there's
some ridiculous love scandal now.

668
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,647
Our stocks are going to be worthless!

669
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,648
You're right.

670
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,985
Should we tell Grandpa? She did the same.

671
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,529
That won't make him forgive us.

672
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:22,822
Don't you know him?

673
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,034
We'll all be out in the streets.

674
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,495
Jeez, I don't know.

675
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,455
What should we do?

676
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,126
Honey, just sit and watch.

677
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:39,255
I'll threaten Seung-a or whatever
to take care of this.

678
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,095
-What?
-She picked up.

679
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,472
Speaker mode.

680
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,311
Hey, you looked great on TV.
Did you get a facial?

681
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,854
Yes. Thanks, bye.

682
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:57,148
Wait! Seung-a! Hey, I'm talking.

683
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,483
What is it?

684
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,109
It was you, right?

685
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:02,195
What'll you do if I tell Grandpa?

686
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,531
Yes, it's me. Do whatever you want.

687
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:10,954
Was that Min-woong?

688
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:11,955
Yes.

689
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,754
I'm glad I have you at least.

690
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:23,466
LJ will finally start running smoothly.

691
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,511
The board may be
on your grandfather's side now,

692
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:31,182
but if they have any sense of shame,
they won't turn a blind eye to this.

693
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,851
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

694
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:39,399
I just had to steal the position,
not just wait anxiously for it.

695
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:45,238
Just take care of Taeyang
so there won't be any issues later.

696
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,199
I will.

697
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:51,953
Oh, right.

698
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:53,663
Father.

699
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,291
There's something I want to ask.

700
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:01,921
Do you know anything
about Mother's accident?

701
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,427
Grandpa seems to be hiding something,

702
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,721
but he just won't tell me.

703
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,351
Well, I don't know anything about it.

704
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,604
Right.

705
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,230
Too bad.

706
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:36,998
LJ GROUP'S SCANDAL

707
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,044
I still

708
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,087
care about him.

709
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,175
I'm going to protect him.

710
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,429
Protect him? When she cheated on him?

711
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:08,571
It must've been tough coming here
with so many reporters around you.

712
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,741
Why did you call me?

713
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,286
To talk about those two, of course.

714
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,375
You know something, don't you?
It's not just an affair, right?

715
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:25,630
No matter how hard I think,
they wouldn't betray you like that.

716
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,218
Well...

717
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,178
Why do you think so?

718
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:35,473
You know better than me
how much they care about you.

719
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,559
And this is the result?

720
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,355
It's my business.

721
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,150
So there's something.

722
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,987
I don't like them seeing each other too.

723
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:54,367
But they shouldn't be scorned
for something they didn't do.

724
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:59,831
If you care about them,
you shouldn't just sit and watch.

725
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:21,144
Someone took all the security camera
footage recorded near the accident scene.

726
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,440
I couldn't find any of the footage.

727
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,985
It's like someone hid it on purpose.

728
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,654
I believe

729
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,324
it'd be at the chairman's house.

730
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:50,631
Just what

731
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,676
is he trying to hide so badly?

732
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:31,130
You can't just sit on your hands
if you want to protect them.

733
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,007
For the first time,

734
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,301
I was ashamed of you.

735
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,639
She doesn't want to marry you.

736
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,183
So stop using her.

737
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:56,781
Hello?

738
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,326
Why aren't you telling the reporters?

739
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,620
You can tell them the truth.

740
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,249
"It was a fake marriage. Do-han is gay."

741
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,920
There's no reason
for you to get witch-hunted like this.

742
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:12,755
Do-han.

743
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,341
I won't.

744
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,970
And I never will do such a thing.

745
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,681
I'm all right.

746
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,684
So there's no need to be anxious

747
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:26,978
or worried.

748
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,314
Let me ask you for the last time.

749
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,025
Why don't we go to New York?

750
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,485
No.

751
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,113
I don't want to run.

752
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,283
I'm going to bear this.

753
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,743
I'll go through this

754
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,538
and protect you and Ji-han.

755
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:48,875
You'll sacrifice yourself to protect us?

756
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,793
I'm not sacrificing myself.

757
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:52,879
I'm protecting myself too.

758
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:58,509
I'm protecting all I have,
so I'm protecting myself.

759
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:05,683
Hey.

760
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:08,477
You just said that maybe

761
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,981
I haven't met someone
more important than friendship.

762
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:16,277
But I'm not sure
if friendship and love have to compete.

763
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,407
I mean, think about it.
If I care for them so much,

764
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,534
they'll care for me as well.

765
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:26,996
Would they just watch
as I have to choose a side?

766
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,080
Then?

767
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,333
They'll

768
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,710
just stay quietly by my side,

769
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,212
protecting me no matter what.

770
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:36,839
I'd do that.

771
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,885
So you should be good to me too.

772
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,929
Loyalty, okay?

773
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,892
You haven't changed at all.

774
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,352
What?

775
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,103
It's nothing.

776
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,607
I'll call you again next time.

777
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,036
Did you talk to Do-han?

778
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,287
Yes.

779
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:51,330
Good.

780
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,376
It was hard
slipping past all the reporters.

781
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,255
It's a relief I had past experience.

782
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,592
That's great,
but don't pretend you're okay.

783
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:04,510
I'm not.

784
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,179
I'm really okay.

785
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,974
Come on, believe me now.

786
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,437
Honestly, a while ago,

787
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,856
I wasn't okay,

788
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,025
but I'm okay now.

789
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,027
I'm great.

790
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,321
It seems like you were...

791
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,284
in an awful state.

792
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,495
You've been crying a lot since you met me.

793
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,914
What?

794
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,583
Are you regretting

795
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,294
not having been good to me?

796
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,504
A little?

797
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:42,506
Then start being good to me.

798
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,514
Make me laugh.

799
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:51,724
Gladly.

800
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,602
What should I do for you, then?

801
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:55,770
Sing?

802
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,730
Or dance?

803
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,482
Or...

804
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,609
do a backflip?

805
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,405
Give me a hug.

806
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,168
Don't worry.

807
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:23,339
I'll laugh as much as I cry,

808
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,091
so it evens out.

809
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,886
I just want you to laugh all the time.

810
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:31,097
Then I'd just be crazy.

811
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:36,894
Is that it?

812
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:38,729
I just wanted

813
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,397
to see your face.

814
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,984
You know,

815
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,613
I love it when I hug you,

816
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,741
but then I can't see you.

817
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:54,328
I can see everything else,

818
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,372
but I can't see...

819
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,708
if you're smiling or crying.

820
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,547
We didn't get to meet today.

821
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,591
And we don't know
when we can see each other again,

822
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:13,055
so I should
engrave your face in my mind today.

823
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:45,838
The press conference is ready.

824
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:00,769
A-jung.

825
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,773
I didn't get to say this yesterday.

826
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:09,737
I'm sorry.

827
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:13,532
I asked you to marry me
because I wanted to breathe,

828
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:17,161
but I was suffocating you instead.

829
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,873
I realized it too late.

830
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,500
But

831
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,294
I won't run away this time.

832
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,006
I'm going to protect you,

833
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,342
Ji-han,

834
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,511
and

835
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:37,723
myself.

836
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,007
Hello.

837
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,760
I'm the fourth grandson of LJ's chairman,

838
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,178
Lee Ji-han.

839
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:40,536
Grandpa.

840
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,413
You idiot.

841
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,582
I gave you so many chances

842
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,086
to cover it up quietly.

843
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:50,546
But do you

844
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:55,175
have to tell the world
what kind of person you really are

845
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,303
after all this time?

846
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,270
I apologize deeply for causing

847
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:08,272
the recent scandal.

848
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:12,985
The reason I'm here today

849
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,864
is to apologize

850
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,868
and correct something that's false.

851
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,080
The scandal about my brother,

852
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,042
his fiancée,

853
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,754
and me

854
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,424
is not true.

855
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,512
She did nothing wrong.

856
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:46,226
I was the one chasing after her.

857
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,776
The only fact about the scandal

858
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,695
is...

859
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,199
that I like her.

860
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,454
I really care for her.

861
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:08,499
That's all.

862
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,503
That is...

863
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,883
the only truth.

864
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:10,060
Even if no one else does,
it's fine as long as you know how I feel.

865
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,146
This was my best option.

866
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,189
You can hate me.

867
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,485
I feel angry now.

868
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:21,655
This is how he's making me stop crying.

869
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,450
Let's live our separate lives now.

870
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:25,909
I like him so much.

871
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,454
I don't think I can live without him.

872
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:30,622
But I don't even know where he is.

873
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,332
I want to be

874
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,042
forgotten quickly.

875
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,836
Bye, Ji-han.
