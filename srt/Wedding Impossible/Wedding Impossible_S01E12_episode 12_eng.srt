1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,770
   
   

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,880
   
   

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,600
   

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,260
   

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,780
     

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,430
   

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,100
   

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,290
   

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,800
   

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,100
   

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,370
 We'll start the shoot now! 

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,940
Okay.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,030
 Shall we smile one more time? 

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:01,890


15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,790
Which one looks good?

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,450
I think this one and this one look fine. What do you think, A Jeong?

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,050
 Are you doing well? 

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,110
I-I like that one, too.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,730
Hello, I came to submit my profile.

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay. You can leave it here.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,360
Oh, yes. Thank you.

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,230
 I'm doing well. 

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,590
 I thought I'd be thinking about you every day. 

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,940
 But is it because life keeps me busy? 

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,530
 That wasn't exactly the case. 

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,430
 I just... 

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,540
 think of you from time to time. 

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,090
 While walking sometimes. 

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,830
 While eating sometimes. 

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,500
Okay, cut.

31
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,720
We'll give it one more go.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,220
A Jeong.

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,940
- I'm sorry. 
 - Didn't you practice?

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,650
I did. I'll try again. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,420
- Seriously. We'll give it a go again. 
 - Yes.

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,880
 While working sometimes. 

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,950
 And during a break sometimes. 

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,350
 Just like that, once in a while. 

40
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,580
 I think I'm doing well, thanks to those once in a while. 

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,940
 I think I endured well. 

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,690
Noona, I think it'll rain soon.

43
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,490
 So I hope you're doing well, too. 

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,970
 Just like last year, 

45
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,550
 Executive Director Choi Min Woong of LJ Hotel and Managing Director Choi Seung Ah of LJ Department Store 

46
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,080
 set out for community service for their late mother's memorial day this year. 

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,530
 This is their first official activity after Ex-President Choi Jong Chan's arrest on 

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,360
 allegations of embezzlement and Ex-Chairman Hyeon Dae Ho's resignation, 

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,030
 which basically disbanded the owner family. 

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,070
 - LJ Group's owner who caused great controversy...  
 - Terry.

51
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,670
- I will be back. 
  - is being seen in a new light. 

52
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,880
 However, public opinion is mostly positive, unlike back then. 

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,850
 There are even some supporters of LJ Group's owner family 

54
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,530
 and the situation has entered a new phase. 

55
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,110
 The political and business sectors are watching how long this public opinion will— 

56
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,730
   

57
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,570
   

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,330
I thought everyone would come during the day like last time.

59
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,350
I didn't think I'd run into you like this.

60
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,700
I came to see your mother.

61
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,690
I almost became her daughter-in-law at one time, you know.

62
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,100
What if she blames me for ruining her two sons?

63
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,560
It was weighing heavy on my heart.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,250
Did I say something?

65
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,180
No, I was worried you'd misunderstand.

66
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,460
"Did she come to see me?"

67
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,500
"Is Na A Jeong still not over me?" That's what I feared.

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,970
They were misunderstandings?

69
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,820
It feels like it was yesterday that I came here last year around this time.

70
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,190
Do Han is in New York and...

71
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,010
No one else came?

72
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,300
Only Grandfather stopped by just now.

73
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,570
- Is he doing well? 
 - Yes.

74
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,340
I only heard about him through Secretary Kim and Eun Taek.

75
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,640
So, I saw him for the first time in a while since then, but he seemed to be doing well.

76
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,240
I think he changed a bit, too.

77
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,910
I'm glad.

78
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,100
How about your family...

79
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,870
They're doing too well.

80
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,680
They're doing way too well.

81
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,540
Oh, right. Ji Oh's starting elementary school.

82
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,660
- Whoa, already? 
 - Yes.

83
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,610
Gosh, our Ji Oh is a genius!

84
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,800
He really did take after my head. Right?

85
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,840
Dad! How can you say such a thing to a kid?

86
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,860
No, I meant my brains, not my hair.

87
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,900
That's even worse. You can at least get implants for hair.

88
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,900
You two won't even let me get a word in.

89
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,410
I beg you! Please be quiet. Okay?

90
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,370
- Are you doing well, Ji Oh? 
 - Yes.

91
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,580
You know I'm swimming in the pains of creative work.

92
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,630
Gosh, you're exaggerating again.

93
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,410
Writer Jo, come trim bean sprouts with us if you can't focus.

94
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,390
Exaggerating, Mother?

95
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,320
It has 100,000 views. 100,000 views per episode!

96
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,230
The long-awaited goal of our Na family.

97
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,160
5,000 strands of Father's hair were paid for with one episode.

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
5,000 strands per episode!

99
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,940
Yes, sure thing, Writer Jo.

100
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,970
You can get back to working hard.

101
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,430
We, lowly ones, will keep our mouths shut.

102
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,870
I request of you.

103
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,280
 - You can't imagine, right?  
 - Gosh, that little!

104
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,380
Tae Min's success is more shocking

105
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,500
than my dad's hair.

106
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,690
How can a person change so much in one year?

107
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,880
Eun Taek and Ji Ae are more shocking than that.

108
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,250
Oh, right. We had those two.

109
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,720
No, my Tinker Bell!

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,060
Hold on. You must be tired from being pregnant. I'll do this.

111
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,550
You can just rest up and sit down. Okay?

112
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,630
- But why are you so pretty? 
 - Gosh, seriously!

113
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,220
Wait, wait. I'll pour it for you.

114
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,790
Just focus on having happy thoughts while kicking back and relaxing.

115
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,430
The food is served! Hurry up and eat before they get cold.

116
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,360
Wait, Tinker Bell, you're not flying, are you?

117
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,330
- Careful. 
 - Thank you.

118
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,570
All right, let's eat.

119
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,980
It looks delicious.

120
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,770
What's this? Are you getting morning sickness in her place now?

121
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,010
No way. All right, be careful when you eat.

122
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,390
It's delicious.

123
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,820
Whoa. It was true?

124
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,600
He's even getting morning sickness in her place now.

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,340
Well, should I wrap this up?

126
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,080
Why bother? Just eat.

127
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,290
So delicious.

128
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,770
How could they get pregnant before getting married?

129
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,150
I didn't think Eun Taek was like that.

130
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,220
That's just how my unni is.

131
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,180
But everyone seems to be doing well, so I'm happy.

132
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,030
True.

133
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,190
Did we forget anyone?

134
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,160
- We did. 
 - Who?

135
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,980
Us.

136
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Let's talk about us instead of other people now.

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,420
What have you been up to, Na A Jeong?

138
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,740
Were you fine without me?

139
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,540
I've been...

140
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,500
doing well.

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,900
I'm very popular these days.

142
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,910
I get important roles in dramas without a problem.

143
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,360
I saw you.

144
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,500
- You saw me? 
 - Come on.

145
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,570
Do you think I was living in a remote countryside or something?

146
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,650
But it's not like I watched every single one because I couldn't get over you.

147
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,670
I saw you while surfing through the channels.

148
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,620
You were the main character's girlfriend.

149
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,540
TV...

150
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,040
By the way, I'm an ex-girlfriend, not a girlfriend.

151
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,130
If I'm the main character's girlfriend, that'd make me a female lead.

152
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,970
- Oh, right. 
 - Watch it thoroughly if you were going to watch it.

153
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm sad that you skimmed through them.

154
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,760
I was too busy to do that.

155
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,260
I started a business with Eun Taek.

156
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,600
You heard, right?

157
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,420
But it's going better than expected.

158
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,650
It's enough to make LJ nervous, I guess?

159
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,260
It looks like you've been doing well, too.

160
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,180
I thought you'd be sad thinking about me.

161
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,470
I did think about you here and there.

162
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,300
I should get going now.

163
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
It's late.

164
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,680
Oh, how did you come? Do you need a ride?

165
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,660
No, my manager is waiting downstairs.

166
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,490
I stopped by while going somewhere for work.

167
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,410
Whoa, a manager!

168
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,810
Here.

169
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,520
I've got another one in the car.

170
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,450
Take it.

171
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,700
Make sure to keep an umbrella with you.

172
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,570
You hate it when it rains.

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,760
Bye now.

174
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,440
 Aunt is here. 

175
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,590
- Gosh. 
 - Aunt's here. She's here!

176
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,620
- I'm here. 
 - Great job.

177
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,670
Have you arrived, Actress Na?

178
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,600
She has arrived.

179
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,420
Seriously.

180
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,410
Aunt!

181
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,910
Ji Oh! Tell me. Did you give my autograph to your friends?

182
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,130
Yes, but they still don't believe you're my aunt.

183
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,210
What? These little kids are so full of distrust.

184
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,100
Aunt should take a picture with you or something.

185
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,470
Ji Oh, would a picture be enough?

186
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,290
Aunt should go pick up Ji Oh from school.

187
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,230
Whoa, yes!

188
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,240
Yay!

189
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,690
I beg you!

190
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,840
Please remain silent.

191
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,550
You're okay, Ji Oh.

192
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,320
I finally wrote a sentence after barely getting focused.

193
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,000
But this time, A Jeong—

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,100
You're the loudest one here!

195
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,580
Enough is enough! Seriously.

196
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,930
Gosh! Nice going, Honey!

197
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,530
Terrible going, Honey.

198
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,240
What do you mean? I paid for his hair.

199
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,710
I need to get some rest.

200
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,380
Yes, rest up.

201
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,450
Goodness, Ji Oh needs a break, too. Right?

202
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,620
 - You're tired, right? 
 - It's time for bed, Ji Oh. 

203
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,340
 I promised to take good care of your son back then, 

204
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,690
 but I'm sorry I couldn't keep it. 

205
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,560
 I actually made things harder for them. 

206
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,650
 For both of them at that. 

207
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:46,480
   

208
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,980
I'm still glad you seem to be doing well.

209
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,840
This is the way it should've been in the first place.

210
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,970
This is the right thing.

211
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,090
 We haven't been here for a long time. 

212
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,680
 I think it's the first time after breaking up with you. 

213
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,130
 Because you had no reason to come here. 

214
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,220
 I couldn't even if I had a reason to come. 

215
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,610
 Afraid I'll be reminded of you. 

216
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,390
 - Have you been doing well?   
- Have you been doing well?

217
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,640
 What about you? 

218
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,260
 - Of course, I've been doing well.  
 - Of course, I've been doing well.

219
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,730
 That's good. 

220
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,820
 Because you had no reason to come here. 

221
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,480
 I couldn't even if I had a reason to come. 

222
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,630
 Afraid I'd be reminded of you. 

223
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,800
 Have you been doing well? 

224
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,630
Doing well, my foot.

225
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,520
 - What about you?  
  - Of course, I've been doing well. 

226
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,570
Even if I thought of you only here and there...

227
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,180
 - That's good.  
 - when I add all of them up...

228
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,550
it's an entire day.

229
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,060
 Because you had no reason to come here. 

230
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,020
 I couldn't even if I had a reason to come. 

231
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,440
 Afraid I'd be reminded of you. 

232
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,040
 Have you been doing well? 

233
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
 What about you? 

234
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,590
 Of course, I've been doing well. 

235
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,570
 Have you been doing well? 

236
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,670
Gosh, this volunteer activity was too tiring.

237
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,630
My arms are still sore after a week.

238
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,620
What do we do? Your arms became the same size as your legs.

239
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,910
If it's that tiring, don't do it.

240
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,400
You have no one to impress. Why force it?

241
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,570
Why are you doing it, then? We're doing it because you're doing it.

242
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,250
You're asking why I volunteer?

243
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,070
You're supposed to volunteer out of good intentions.

244
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,270
Would I believe that, huh?

245
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,600
You should serve us first before you volunteer for anyone else.

246
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,470
- Why would I? 
 - What do you mean?

247
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,200
We're the most unfortunate people.

248
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,870
Thanks to you, the board was shattered, Father went to prison,

249
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,800
and Grandfather resigned to take responsibility.

250
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,310
Secretary Kim, who had nothing to do with this, became a CEO.

251
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,220
What's all this about?

252
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,630
I mean, I can understand the board going south.

253
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,270
Why is Father's embezzlement my fault?

254
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,170
It's your fault. It's all your fault.

255
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,670
I don't have proof, but y-your weird white shirt is telling me everything.

256
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,920
Why did she wear white?

257
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,880
Sure. Your senses got a little better since you aged one more year.

258
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,950
What?

259
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,360
What do you mean?

260
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,570
It's nothing. You don't need to know.

261
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,900
Secretary Kim!

262
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,590
It's President Kim. Gosh, Honey, come on.

263
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,170
Is it because I've known him for too long?

264
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,390
We should just be Mister and Min Woong. How is it? Nice, right?

265
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,830
Not at all, Executive Director Choi.

266
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,180
What brings you in here again today?

267
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,850
It's not like I can stay at the hotel forever. So, you know?

268
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,230
Could you find a spot for him elsewhere, please?

269
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,840
Such as electronics or trading, you know?

270
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm not sure.

271
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,540
I don't think that will be happening.

272
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,330
And you, Managing Director Choi?

273
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,200
I came to watch these two being this way.

274
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,430
If you do this again at the upcoming family meeting, your grandfather will be furious.

275
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,260
The family meeting? Grandfather? Why?

276
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,800
What do you mean? Do Han is coming back today.

277
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,340
Lee Do Han!

278
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,770
A Jeong!

279
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,720
- What's this? How've you been? 
 - Good.

280
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,010
Hey, you look good.

281
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,430
Come on. I was just severely unhappy when you last saw me.

282
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,390
Let's go. Your noona will give you a ride.

283
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,900
What's this? You rented a car again?

284
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,970
No, it's mine.

285
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,760
You bought a car? Which one?

286
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,240
How's my lovely new wagon?

287
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,430
Wow, it's nice. It's really cozy.

288
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,610
- Right? I made a lot of progress? 
 - Yes.

289
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,380
Though it's not as good as the convertible from last time.

290
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,840
It means we're that transparent with each other. Right?

291
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,080
But you should rest up today.

292
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,230
Would you be too busy if you came for your exhibition?

293
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,600
Come on. I won't be that busy.

294
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,010
Really? We should grab a drink soon, then.

295
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,010
Deal. I love it.

296
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,620
Should we invite Ji Han, too?

297
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,160
Hey, let's talk about this honestly since we're not hiding anything.

298
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,850
You really won't see Ji Han?

299
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,320
- So suddenly? 
 - What's so sudden?

300
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,490
I kept asking you while I was in New York.

301
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,200
And you hung up each time, saying there was no signal.

302
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,610
You're right. I didn't even try to hide it.

303
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,100
Seriously, goodness.

304
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,750
I know you feel guilty about me.

305
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,070
However, I'm really happy right now.

306
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,860
I became more durable and confident.

307
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,810
I really mean this.

308
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,980
Yes.

309
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,560
So you should be more at peace, too.

310
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,890
Lee Do Han, you've matured while you were away!

311
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,610
However, Do Han, I'm doing really well these days.

312
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:26,610
I'm having so much fun with acting, and that's how it is.

313
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,060
All right. It's fine if you're happy.

314
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,580
Ji Han.

315
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,450
Ji Han!

316
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,850
You're here.

317
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,600
It must've been a long trip.

318
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
You must be tired. Get some rest.

319
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,780
I think you look more tired.

320
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,130
Ji Han! Go sleep in your room.

321
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,150
Ji Han!

322
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,570
You woke up early.

323
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,140
You're up. Come eat.

324
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,900
You're looking a bit better today.

325
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,230
Yes, I was too tired from work yesterday.

326
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,040
Whoa, it looks fantastic.

327
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,860
Help yourself.

328
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,060
Well, how is it eating a home-cooked meal after a year?

329
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,360
It's delicious.

330
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,460
I couldn't get it to taste like this in New York.

331
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,530
Of course. There's an ingredient you can never get there.

332
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,520
An ingredient? What is it?

333
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,360
Love and effort.

334
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,560
Gosh, I just lost all of my appetite.

335
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,770
I'm kidding.

336
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,010
I guess you really wanted to eat this.

337
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,660
You're even eating carrots you never used to eat.

338
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,910
I grew up a little. I'm a year older.

339
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,670
Oh, is that so?

340
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,210
Have some more of this, then. Okay?

341
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,640
I think I aged.

342
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,380
I don't have an appetite after becoming a year older.

343
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,080
Being tired from work is just an excuse. It's because of A Jeong. Right?

344
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,680
You still don't keep in touch with her?

345
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,730
It's not like that.

346
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,030
Yeah, right.

347
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,230
   

348
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,420
Yes, Grandfather.

349
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,470
Did your brother get home okay?

350
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,980
Yes.

351
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,580
Brother went to his studio.

352
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,780
He had lots to do.

353
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,220
Did I say something? I'm sure he's busy.

354
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,590
Having you tagging along to come fishing with me is the problem. You're a young man, you know.

355
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,180
Aren't you even seeing anyone?

356
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,460
I'm not.

357
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,760
You aren't seeing A Jeong?

358
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,700
She's someone I shouldn't see.

359
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,040
Why?

360
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,080
Yeah. That does feel a bit wrong. Right?

361
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,770
You shouldn't have said anything.

362
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,320
Hey.

363
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,450
You take this.

364
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,900
Why do you have this, Grandfather?

365
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,260
   

366
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,500
I had given this to Secretary Kim when I was little.

367
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,710
- I bought it from him. 
 - What?

368
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,430
I bought it from Secretary Kim.

369
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,500
Did Secretary Kim have nothing better to sell you?

370
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,600
And you had nothing better to buy?

371
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,960
It was really expensive.

372
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,300
Anyhow...

373
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,600
all the bad things I had done to you and A Jeong...

374
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,700
Just call it even with that one. Got it?

375
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,670
Why are you doing this suddenly?

376
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,000
That day when I went to see your mom,

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,960
I saw the two of you together.

378
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,190
She really seems like a nice girl.

379
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,160
Even after going through all that, she came by for your mom's memorial day.

380
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,210
I just felt thankful and sorry at the same time.

381
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,800
Anyhow, we called it even with that coupon of yours.

382
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,450
So, don't even think about using me as an excuse and figure it out between you guys.

383
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,560
It's not like that.

384
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,050
It's just that...

385
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,500
I feel bad.

386
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,670
And Grandfather, what's the use now?

387
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:27,460
I mean, A Jeong doesn't seem to be doing too well, either.

388
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,200
Just like you.

389
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,360
Gosh, is our spot the problem here?

390
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Grandfather, what's the use now?

391
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,350
 Ji Oh! 

392
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,420
Man, what a nice car.

393
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,800
It does look great.

394
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,100
- Huh? 
 - It looks great.

395
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,300
- Ji Oh. 
 - Yes?

396
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,620
I will buy you a cool car like that one.

397
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,690
 What about me? 

398
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,610
How can you still be sleeping in at your age?

399
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,520
- I'm late. 
 - Actress Na! Actress—

400
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,750
Have a great day.

401
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,520
Lee Ji Han?

402
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,850
It's really Lee Ji Han.

403
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,900
What brings you here?

404
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,300
To return this umbrella. You might need it.

405
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
Sorry?

406
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,170
You don't know what will happen in the future.

407
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,340
You should always be prepared.

408
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,350
What if it rains later?

409
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,390
Are you cursing me?

410
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,900
I just came by to talk to you.

411
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,100
I don't think I was honest during our last conversation.

412
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,290
I'll just use it as a sunshade.

413
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,590
That's not the problem right now.

414
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,130
- Give me a ride. 
 - Sorry?

415
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,500
I've got a shoot today.

416
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,240
But my manager's got appendicitis, so he can't go.

417
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,730
So give me a ride.

418
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,200
Let me ask you just this once.

419
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,570
- Sorry? 
 - What are you doing? Start driving!

420
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,660
I said I'm late.

421
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,670
   

422
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,910
   

423
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,930
I told you I'm fine. Why did you follow me here?

424
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,690
How could I leave you alone? I'd be too anxious. Careful.

425
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,500
- What if you pass out? 
 - Gosh.

426
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
All right, let's go. Okay? Oops.

427
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,280
Brother-in-law, you look more fragile than Unni.

428
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,820
- Let's go. 
 - Let's hurry.

429
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,200
Geez, why isn't this guy picking up?

430
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,100
Is he doing well at work by himself or not?

431
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,800
♫  What's this? This feeling is unfamiliar and awkward  ♫

432
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,670
It tastes pretty good.

433
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,110
This isn't the main characters' story but a very important scene.

434
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,940
Don't worry about it.

435
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,400
I came totally prepared.

436
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,780
- As expected, A Jeong! I'm counting on you. 
 - Yes.

437
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,090
- Get ready. 
 - Yes, Director.

438
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,450
- See you later. 
 - Yes.

439
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,590
♫  Am I just a good friend to you?  ♫

440
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,770
♫  It's so frustrating, I can't hold it in  ♫

441
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,130
It's totally different. Even the way he treats you.

442
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,560
I told you it's different.

443
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,300
How did you know I needed my bag?

444
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,600
Since you volunteered to be my manager for the day, I'm counting on you.

445
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,900
- By the way... 
 - Yes.

446
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,890
what did you mean you came prepared?

447
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,550
It's not an action or horse-riding scene. Right?

448
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,300
It's not.

449
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,000
That's a relief. I was worried you might get hurt again.

450
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,200
What action and horse-riding scene would we film on a set?

451
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,110
Right.

452
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,380
Then?

453
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,370
A kiss scene.

454
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,300
W-What?

455
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,110
A-A kiss scene?

456
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,550
Yes. Why?

457
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,700
How can you say that without even flinching in front of me?

458
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,200
What's the matter?

459
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,970
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

460
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,170
You said you were glad because I wouldn't be getting hurt.

461
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,240
My feelings are hurt.

462
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
- Na A Jeong. 
 - Hey.

463
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,300
- You came. 
 - Yeah.

464
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,100
- When did you come? 
 - Two hours ago.

465
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,100
A kiss scene?

466
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,260
- Hey. 
 - Do I have something?

467
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,600
Please stop it.

468
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,070
What is it?

469
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,500
He's my manager for the day.

470
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,140
Yes, the manager.

471
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,600
I've been scouted as an actor many times, but it's my first time as a manager.

472
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,500
Oh, that's why you didn't look that close.

473
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,950
We're very close. That's why I was just playing with her.

474
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,170
- Yes. 
 - Oh, you're close.

475
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,200
That's great. Yes.

476
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,100
You know how distant and uncomfortable relationships develop into romantic ones.

477
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,790
There'd be no chance for a scandal. Right?

478
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,120
I don't think that would apply to me.

479
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,640
Because we're past that stage already.

480
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,610
What stage could you be on?

481
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,000
What's the matter with you two?

482
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,990
- Na A Jeong— 
 - You stop it, too, Lee Ji Han.

483
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,600
You, too, Oppa.

484
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,100
- All right. 
 - Oppa?

485
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,020
Oppa?

486
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,770
W-What's the matter with you, seriously?

487
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,060
You just called him oppa, right?

488
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,400
What's your deal? You're embarrassing me.

489
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,430
- You're embarrassed? 
 - What's gotten into you?

490
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,280
A Jeong!

491
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,540
They're both very tall.

492
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,310
Could it be you've gone mad? Huh?

493
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,310
Just how much do you think that project is worth? Huh?

494
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,530
Do you plan to miss it?

495
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,050
I had no other choice but to take the day off because Ji Ae

496
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,910
became pregnant with our precious child.

497
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,700
But what on earth could you be doing here right now?

498
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,600
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,200
Does sorry take care of all our—

500
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,610
Hey, Lee Ji Han.

501
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,290
- What, "Lee Ji Han"? 
 - Why? What's wrong?

502
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,440
Oh, it's way too late for us to skip honorifics. Right?

503
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,070
But am I still your employee or something?

504
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,200
We're partners, all right?

505
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,600
On top of that, I'm way older than you.

506
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,610
Also, my title was always higher.

507
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,880
Owner family.

508
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,580
I think it's because our Ji Han still hasn't gotten rid of his conglomerate habits.

509
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,030
How much more do you have to starve to know better?

510
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,430
You don't have the desperation.

511
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,760
How many times did you say we can't miss that project?

512
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,670
You were the one who said so!

513
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,830
Please let me off the hook today.

514
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,520
A much larger, once-in-a-lifetime project is at stake.

515
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,710
Nope.

516
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,850
I absolutely won't let you off the hook.

517
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,800
I can just tell what's going on.

518
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,420
You're trying to get back with A Jeong, huh?

519
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,460
- The thing is— 
 - Whatever the thing is,

520
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,810
we're against it.

521
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,400
Sis had such a hard time because of you.

522
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,360
While she was seeing you, of course.

523
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,370
It was even worse after breaking up with you.

524
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,360
I know.

525
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,920
- You know? 
 - That's why...

526
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,340
I'll take responsibility and make her way happier.

527
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,690
It's her boyfriend.

528
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,360
- Sorry? 
 - That's A Jeong's boyfriend over there.

529
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,130
No way. I didn't hear anything about that.

530
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,070
Why do you care? They're dating in secret.

531
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,510
Would it be a secret if you knew when you had nothing to do with her?

532
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,630
They're serious about each other.

533
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,470
So, don't shake her up when she finally pulled herself together.

534
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,840
I mean, I understand you don't like me, but...

535
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,590
I mean...

536
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,530
Even so...

537
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,990
Where are you going?

538
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,480
What's wrong with him?

539
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,200
I told you I won't go on blind dates anymore.

540
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,130
 So why won't you? 

541
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,840
 Is it because you're still not over Ji Han? 

542
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,650
Father, that's not it—

543
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,660
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

544
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,850
 Then why? Why? 

545
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,730
Forget it. Anyhow, this blind date will be the last one.

546
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,040
I don't care after this. You can cut them off on your end.

547
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,800
- Sorry for the trouble. 
 - Sure, take care.

548
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,380
Who are you?

549
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,370
You're Yoon Chae Won. Right?

550
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,650
I asked who you are first?

551
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,170
I'm Bin Tae Hwan.

552
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,820
I'm the second son of TY Constructions and a director there.

553
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,190
I'm 34, 180 cm tall, and weigh 70 kg.

554
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,140
I don't really have a hobby, but I'm good at pretty much everything.

555
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,730
I'm sorry, but I haven't heard about this meeting.

556
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,950
I'm sure you didn't.

557
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,890
I think you hung up without even hearing your father out.

558
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,330
At the lobby, we even bumped into each other.

559
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,980
 Father, that's not it— 

560
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,160
 - I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry. 

561
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,720
 Forget it. Anyhow... 

562
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,260
- Quite the fate, right? 
 - How did you recognize me in the first place?

563
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:26,150
I was probably the third person you'd have met after the one you just had.

564
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,240
This Friday.

565
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,300
But you said you won't go on blind dates anymore.

566
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,530
I missed you about a year ago like this, so I couldn't miss you again like this.

567
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,020
Love is something you fight for.

568
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,190
So you were eavesdropping, huh?

569
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,290
I just overheard you. Would that be a minus?

570
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,420
It's critical.

571
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,050
- I should make up for it. 
 - Not a chance.

572
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,590
Since I'm going to leave now.

573
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,480
   

574
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,810
Even if I come out, I'm just drinking with you here.

575
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,660
You used to like hanging out with me like this.

576
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,480
You said I made mundane things special for you.

577
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,830
As I was saying, think about how long ago it was when I said that.

578
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,260
That was so long ago.

579
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,870
Whoa, you're so scary.

580
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,800
How can a person's feelings change instantly like this?

581
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,220
Na A Jeong has a boyfriend.

582
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,930
This was it.

583
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,070
Asking for business advice was an excuse.

584
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,620
Even so, isn't it wrong to do this in front of a woman who used to have a crush on you?

585
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,960
Make some friends or something, Ji Han!

586
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,460
No.

587
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,100
I can't trust people anymore.

588
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,030
Hey, drink slowly!

589
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,000
Good job again today!

590
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,610
- Cheers. 
 - Great job.

591
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,590
 You don't know what will happen in the future. 

592
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,510
 What if it rains later? 

593
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,740
 Curse me? 

594
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,520
 I just came by to talk to you. 

595
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,490
 I don't think I was honest during our last conversation. 

596
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,860
Your manager called me this morning.

597
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,400
He said you wouldn't come out.

598
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,160
You didn't come with Lee Ji Han, did you?

599
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,390
What now?

600
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,420
You're trying to do it again, huh?

601
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,620
Don't tell me you're waiting for him!

602
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,490
I understand you're wavering because of your ex-boyfriend.

603
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,210
But you can't do that now, Na A Jeong.

604
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,580
It's not like that, Unni.

605
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,710
We already blocked him off, knowing that.

606
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,670
- What? 
 - We told him everything.

607
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,740
So everything about what?

608
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,410
Are you crazy?

609
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,920
Why would you say that to Lee Ji Han?

610
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,400
He kept trying to score a chance with you.

611
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,600
- Right? 
 - Totally.

612
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,940
Hello?

613
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,410
W-What did you say?

614
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,370
Seriously? I was wondering what he was up to, and he was drinking, huh?

615
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,600
With his first love, on top of that.

616
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,120
Long time no see. I'm sorry, but take him with you.

617
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,980
I just can't handle him.

618
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,510
I'm not interested in handling him.

619
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,700
Why would you give this to me?

620
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,510
Call Do Han or something.

621
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,910
You take him, Yoon Chae Won.

622
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,780
You wanted to have him!

623
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,700
Didn't you want him, too?

624
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,860
Take him.

625
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,220
Hey, Lee Ji Han. You choose.

626
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,490
Is it me or Na A Jeong?

627
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,390
Think carefully.

628
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,340
- Na A Jeong! 
 - Gosh.

629
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,400
I told you to think carefully. Seriously!

630
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,560
I wish you good luck. Bye now.

631
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,950
You're really leaving?

632
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,080
Gosh, Yoon Chae Won. Yoon Chae Won!

633
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,130
I like Na A Jeong the most!

634
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,050
Why'd you choose me?

635
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,430
Gosh, it's so annoying!

636
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,650
What's wrong?

637
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,420
Life is so boring.

638
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,870
It really is you, Yoon Chae Won.

639
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,830
We meet again in just three hours.

640
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,640
Whoa, forget I said it was boring.

641
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,220
- Sorry? 
 - How did you know it was me?

642
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,940
You only saw me from the back.

643
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,790
Not sure. It's been a while since I've fallen for you.

644
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,810
Oh, since three hours ago?

645
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,390
No, since your wedding.

646
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,490
I was a guest of the groom's side.

647
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,780
That's why I asked for a blind date.

648
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,730
I'm sorry if I was rude at the hotel.

649
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,760
Still, I absolutely wasn't half-hearted.

650
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,720
That's not the problem right now.

651
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,060
Are you saying you fell for someone else's bride?

652
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,070
I choose love over friendship.

653
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,100
Is it immoral? Another minus?

654
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,740
Yes. It's a critical one again.

655
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,580
Why don't you focus on my self-discipline since I didn't act on it?

656
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,160
Or you can say the bride was way too beautiful.

657
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,070
Please get in. I'll give you a ride.

658
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,910
This won't be enough to make up for it.

659
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,560
This is just my sincerity...

660
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,860
Did I make up for some of it?

661
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,440
I did act cute while drunk a few times...

662
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,420
and this is how you take your revenge?

663
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,110
Just stay still, seriously!

664
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,760
You just yelled at me.

665
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,950
You're so mean.

666
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,790
Let me ask you something.

667
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,920
How could...

668
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,490
How could your love change?

669
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,100
I spent every single day thinking about you,

670
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,880
staying faithful and loyal.

671
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,220
Don't make me laugh.

672
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,170
Yet you couldn't even distinguish whether I was a girlfriend or an ex?

673
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,400
You think I couldn't?

674
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,200
Am I an idiot? I remember everything if I saw it once.

675
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,600
I watched that drama so many times over and over until I memorized all the lines.

676
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,610
Really?

677
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,910
"Break up with that oppa right away.

678
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,280
You supported him for seven years while he studied for the state exam.

679
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,270
But he went to another woman after passing the state exam!

680
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,730
He is a lowlife, okay?

681
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,290
You really shouldn't be around someone like that. Really."

682
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,600
I guess you're serious.

683
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,900
When you were crying after you broke up, my heart ached so much.

684
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,820
But this is all from the drama.

685
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,500
You can't just say it's from the drama. Okay?

686
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,340
When you see your oppa acting, he's very good at portraying his character.

687
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,360
That means he's very similar to the character. It's dangerous. Really dangerous.

688
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,910
Na A Jeong,

689
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,590
break up.

690
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,950
Break up.

691
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,240
Break up. Break up.

692
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,600
This is just like the old times.

693
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,200
Na A Jeong.

694
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,910
It's dangerous.

695
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,630
What about Ji Han?

696
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,960
Is he coming late, or is he not coming?

697
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,910
Ji Han said he had something to do today, so he couldn't come.

698
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,560
As if he really does have something to do.

699
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,590
- And you do, Brother? 
 - Thanks to you-know-who, I can't do anything.

700
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,340
Anyhow, it's been so long, Do Han.

701
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,190
I didn't think you'd come back for an exhibition.

702
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,100
You never know in life, right?

703
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,470
- If I were him, I'd just live peacefully in hiding— 
 - Come on!

704
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,010
Come on.

705
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,700
You keep spitting food. Close your mouth and eat.

706
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,400
- How can I eat with my mouth closed? 
 - Don't eat, then.

707
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,310
Eat.

708
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,750
Eat.

709
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,370
Eat. You can eat.

710
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,760
So is the exhibition preparation going well?

711
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,910
Aren't the reporters bothering you?

712
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,460
Well, no. I'll take care of myself, Grandfather.

713
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,480
Of course.

714
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,600
I know you'll take care of it just fine.

715
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,680
I made some carp extracts, so take it with you and drink one every morning. Okay?

716
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,530
You need stamina until you finish your exhibition.

717
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,370
Don't just trust your stamina solely because you're young.

718
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,870
What?

719
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,020
I made yours, too!

720
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,220
I made some for Seung Ah and Se Jin.

721
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,600
All of you, take one each.

722
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,690
I caught it myself. Okay?

723
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,600
   

724
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,380
I heard the news.

725
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,020
You're doing an exhibition, huh?

726
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,030
Did you leave the States for good?

727
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,600
No, not for good. Just briefly.

728
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,400
But what brings you here?

729
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,800
I thought I should tell you.

730
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,490
I'm sorry for what I did back then.

731
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:53,710
For making you suffer, just to pay you back for making me suffer.

732
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,900
In a way, it was my fault...

733
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,210
your secret was exposed.

734
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,550
You don't have to be sorry.

735
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,200
It was all my choice.

736
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,480
I was too cowardly back then.

737
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,750
I always ran away and avoided it.

738
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,540
So, let's stop being sorry to each other.

739
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,650
Okay.

740
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,020
Good luck with the exhibition.

741
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,410
I don't know if I'll have time to go, but...

742
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,370
I'll go.

743
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,110
You draw the eyes now, huh?

744
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,000
Oh, it's not scary anymore.

745
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,870
I'm picking up on things I've avoided out of fear. One by one.

746
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:42,150
You should pretend to be sleeping. Why pretend to be dead?

747
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,030
Please revive yourself.

748
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,700
I made pollock soup.

749
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,820
- You didn't leave. 
 - I was too tired.

750
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,840
Hurry up and come out.

751
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,970
- Did you make this? 
 - What if I did?

752
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,790
I might not come back to life if that's the case.

753
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,130
Do Han made it.

754
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,980
- Happy? 
 - Yes.

755
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,160
Don't worry. I won't make fun of you.

756
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,320
People can do that when they're drunk.

757
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,930
I understand.

758
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,710
"How can your love change?"

759
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,880
You might want to throw a philosophical question.

760
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,110
What are faithfulness and loyalty?

761
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,380
You might want to discuss moral topics. Right?

762
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,640
I'll get going now, then.

763
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,790
Okay.

764
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,010
Wait, Na A Jeong.

765
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:19,570
What I said yesterday really wasn't just alcohol talking.

766
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,890
- I really— 
 - Hey, you there!

767
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,230
Stop right there.

768
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,640
I caught you red-handed.

769
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,410
I knew something was off.

770
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,790
I told you, right?

771
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,800
It was definitely this car.

772
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,400
- It's been here for two days. 
 - Two days?

773
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:03,570
Go ahead and explain why you were standing there with A Jeong

774
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,630
in front of our house.

775
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,990
You'll have to explain yourself very well, with a logical flow.

776
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,840
I mean, I said it's not like that.

777
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,790
- You be quiet. 
 - No, that's not the case right now!

778
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,960
It is the case.

779
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,660
Hello, Lee Ji Han?

780
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,730
What are you saying? You know, it's not.

781
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,530
What are you saying is the case?

782
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,620
Huh?

783
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,930
I don't know about Na A Jeong.

784
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,840
But I like Na A Jeong.

785
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,480
Rather,

786
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,880
I love her.

787
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,570
I know you'll think it ridiculous to be doing this now...

788
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,100
after breaking up a year ago.

789
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,970
But I'll listen quietly if you curse me out and take it if you beat me up.

790
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,840
But even if I were to be beaten to death,

791
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,490
I can't get rid of these feelings.

792
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,410
Because...

793
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,780
I can't live without Na A Jeong.

794
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,760
My goodness.

795
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,730
If that's the case,

796
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,710
why did you make such a big deal with that press conference and

797
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,980
stay away from A Jeong like that?

798
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,540
Back then,

799
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,500
I thought staying apart from each other was for the best.

800
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,530
I thought time would heal and...

801
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,500
we'd forget it all if we didn't see each other.

802
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,750
But now I know.

803
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:48,600
I know what an arrogant and foolish decision that was.

804
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,810
So, I won't make the same mistake ever again.

805
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,150
Though it's late, I'll try my best.

806
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,230
This plot is too predictable.

807
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,310
He's about to ask them for their daughter.

808
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,860
It's exactly that timing.

809
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,800
Mother and Father,

810
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,620
I'll give myself to you.

811
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:14,560
- Please take me in. 
 - Wait—

812
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,460
- Lee Ji Han. 
 - Whoa.

813
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,030
He's a formidable foe.

814
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,430
I'm not interested in doing that.

815
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:24,630
Also, per our experience,

816
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:30,290
we've had enough with taking in Son-in-law Jo.

817
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:33,260
I'm not asking you to take me in right away.

818
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,560
I'll try as much as I can.

819
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,130
I'll try my best, Father.

820
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,250
It looks like you were preparing to eat. Is there anything I can help—

821
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,190
- No, wait— 
 - Should I serve rice first, Mother?

822
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,050
- No, that's not— 
 - Should I serve the soup first?

823
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,440
- N-No, no— 
 - Okay, got it.

824
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,880
- Come this way. 
 - Yes.

825
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,100
- Rice is over there. 
 - Here.

826
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,800
No, bring that over here and...

827
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,950
Over there.

828
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:03,090
Goodness, we've got one more problem now.

829
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,850
This is why you should've just gone home.

830
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,910
Why did you say you'll eat with us?

831
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,360
You knew you'd get indigestion.

832
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,340
I'm sorry about that, Na A Jeong.

833
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,560
Your boyfriend.

834
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,090
I'm sure you're feeling guilty right now.

835
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,060
That oppa isn't my boyfriend.

836
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,310
- What? 
 - I was going to tell you early on.

837
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,580
But I missed the timing.

838
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,800
You were kind of cute, and

839
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,610
I also wanted to keep teasing you. Happy?

840
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,390
But I didn't know you'd go this far.

841
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,540
Let's call it even.

842
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,910
Call what even?

843
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:32,610
I'm sure you saw me often on TV all this time, and that's not fair.

844
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,350
I couldn't do that.

845
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:39,200
So, I've been shoving down my desire to see you.

846
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,670
You know,

847
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:48,000
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

848
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,740
The face I wanted to see so badly.

849
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,750
This person I wanted to hug so badly.

850
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,600
It made me wonder how I managed to hold back all this time.

851
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,630
When I had you by my side, I was finally able to breathe.

852
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,170
What's wrong?

853
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,040
This wasn't it originally.

854
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,220
I had made a plan originally.

855
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:33,550
I figured you'd need some time to break up with that oppa and come to me.

856
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:38,150
So, I was going to plan an innovative and cool way to propose by then.

857
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,300
What's that now?

858
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,520
I have no choice.

859
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,200
I'll go straight ahead before I miss you again.

860
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,050
Na A Jeong...

861
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,970
let's get married.

862
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,650
Sorry?

863
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,370
Please let me be your husband.

864
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,800
Not your brother-in-law,

865
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,390
not your manager,

866
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:15,340
and not a lover you can stop seeing at any given moment after a fight.

867
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:23,050
Even if we fight, we'll still sleep in the same bed that night.

868
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,610
In the middle of the night, we can go watch a movie holding hands.

869
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,040
When you doze off in the morning,

870
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,020
I can dry your hair instead.

871
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:47,670
A husband who cleans the floor all day with a lint roller because of that hair.

872
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,580
Let me be a husband like that to you.

873
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,000
♫  Without realizing...  ♫

874
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,670
What's this?

875
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,740
Is this really a proposal?

876
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,600
Yes.

877
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,870
Though it's a mess because I feel rushed.

878
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:18,450
♫  If you feel the same way I do, could you say so?  ♫

879
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:21,090
Why is our proposal a mess, too?

880
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,600
You're consistent as a person, for sure.

881
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,980
My feelings will also be consistent.

882
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,430
Am I not trustworthy?

883
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,200
I'm not sure.

884
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,180
I'm tired of preparing for a marriage now.

885
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,330
That's all the more reason to marry me.

886
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,130
We have already visited each of our families,

887
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,540
had the family introduction,

888
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,960
and even lived together.

889
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,760
We just have to get married for real. Right?

890
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,760
♫  Our love has already begun  ♫

891
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,300
I'm cost-efficient, you see.

892
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,060
I'll try to play hard-to-get just enough.

893
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,700
I'll pursue you aggressively.

894
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:13,840
♫  When I look at you, my day becomes filled to the brim  ♫

895
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,960
♫  I think about which sides of me will make your heart flutter  ♫

896
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,210
♫  Every day, I imagine all kinds of things  ♫

897
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:28,970
♫  I want to know everything about you  ♫

898
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:33,280
♫  You entered my heart without me realizing  ♫

899
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,310
♫  And hotter than the sunlight in midday  ♫

900
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:41,090
♫  You filled me with warmth  ♫

901
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,610
♫  Even when I close my eyes, I can see you clearly  ♫

902
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:49,840
♫  I can't describe it all with words  ♫

903
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,730
♫  My feelings grew so big they'll explode  ♫

904
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:59,870
♫  Until they reach you, I'll come to you little by little  ♫

905
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:04,310
♫  Our love has already begun  ♫

906
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:03,500
Do the two of you vow to only love each other until death do you apart?

907
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,520
Yes.

908
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,830
Yes.

909
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,020
Serves you right.

910
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,410
Who said you could marry someone other than me?

911
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,260
What brings you here?

912
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,060
What do you mean?

913
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,700
I came to object to this marriage.

914
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:42,570
Hey, get inside!

915
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,900
Open the umbrella!

916
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:12,850
 It's impossible for anyone to be honest all the time. 

917
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,070
 Living is a series of lies. 

918
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,960
 To hide your weakness... 

919
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,530
 To hide your clumsy side... 

920
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:03,480
 And to become a better person, you've been putting on an act all those days. 

921
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,610
Let us also be independent instead of leaching off of someone else.

922
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,140
So, will things turn out for us?

923
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,980
And also...

924
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,060
A Jeong's premiere isn't today. It's tomorrow.

925
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,990
Yes.

926
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,750
Be careful, Tinker Bell.

927
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:32,190
Gosh, doesn't it hurt?

928
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:40,600
Gosh, why are you giving me morning sickness, too?

929
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,120
What do you need to show me?

930
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,640
Gosh, you won't listen to me just because you're successful.

931
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,710
It's this.

932
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,090
   

933
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,110
What's this?

934
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,160
It got published?

935
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,340
I'm Soo Jeong's man, Crystal Man!

936
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,940
I'll pamper you for the rest of your life!

937
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,310
Ji Oh and Soo Jeong, let's move out!

938
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,610
Goodness, I think I'm going to retire now.

939
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,400
Why?

940
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,680
So, you could follow me around? Aren't you sick of it?

941
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,740
- Gosh, just be quiet and drink. 
 - Goodness.

942
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,470
You've got years ahead of you.

943
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,260
It's okay.

944
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,410
Let me get a break.

945
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:39,390
My goodness, you're looking way too good.

946
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,790
 But now we know. 

947
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:47,150
 Regardless of how I look or what situation I'm in, 

948
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,550
 I have you by my side. 

949
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,880
 That I can truly be myself if I'm with you. 

950
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:04,130
I'll never let go of you, Na A Jeong.

951
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:08,200
I can't. I'm going to hold onto you tightly.

952
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,950
 And I love you as you are. 

953
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:26,540
 Exactly as you are by my side.

♫  Over the skyline, dive down past it  ♫

968
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:54,510
♫  I fly with you, azure feelings come blowing  ♫
