1
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,226
I realized then

2
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,853
that making yourself

3
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:48,359
a pathetic coward was
the best you could do.

4
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,495
This place hasn't changed,

5
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,956
even after five years.

6
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,708
-Dae-hyeon.
-You're famous.

7
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,710
I saw the news.

8
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,172
You even have a girlfriend.

9
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,632
-Dae-hyeon.
-Does she know

10
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,552
she's dating a total fake?

11
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,846
I'm getting married.

12
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,392
I'm not going to make excuses
for what happened back then.

13
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,227
So don't come here

14
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,145
and don't fix stuff for me.

15
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,190
Just focus on your own happiness.

16
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,694
I kept thinking on my way here,

17
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,323
"Why am I going to see
someone I ended things with?"

18
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,784
But I know now.

19
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:40,995
Lee Do-han.

20
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,372
I think

21
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,208
I want to hurt you.

22
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,794
So I'm going to do it

23
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,172
for my own happiness.

24
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,111
If it breaks again, you'll think of me.

25
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,280
Call me then.

26
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,299
NA A-JUNG

27
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,343
The person you are calling...

28
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,719
Darn it.

29
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,845
Ji-han.

30
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:41,972
Ji-han?

31
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,767
Get a grip, will you?

32
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,311
A-jung, stand properly.

33
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,687
Are you drunk?

34
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,315
Lean on me. I'll take you home.

35
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,820
I was stupid to be grateful for you.

36
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,573
Why did you try to help me

37
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,368
if you were going to
make me suffer like this?

38
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,370
But you were touched.

39
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:08,123
You were angry
when I was getting insulted!

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,501
Ji-han.

41
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,964
My house is nearby. Twenty minutes away
on foot and five by bike.

42
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,634
I could have gone home
and gone to bed by now.

43
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,053
You're wasting my time out here.

44
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,184
These broad things are my shoulders, okay?

45
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,061
You're surprised, aren't you?

46
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,689
That's why you won't lean on me.

47
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,524
Jeez!

48
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,484
Don't you like my shoulders?

49
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,194
Did you say

50
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,032
it takes five minutes

51
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,201
by bike to your house?

52
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,370
Then I'll take you home in three!

53
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,205
Let me down!

54
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,082
Let me down!

55
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,003
Stop! Let me down!

56
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,855
Ji-han.

57
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,232
Ji-han, wake up.

58
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,776
Ji-han.

59
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,619
The person you are calling...

60
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,457
The boat's leaving in ten. Let's hurry.

61
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,208
Min-seob.

62
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,794
I think I should head back to Seoul.

63
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,217
Ji-han has never ignored

64
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,844
my calls for over an hour.

65
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,263
He usually contacts me 24/7

66
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,015
even when it's my day off.

67
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,894
But he hasn't picked up for 12 hours.
Something's wrong.

68
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,189
Taek, you're too obsessed.

69
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,067
It's the weekend. I bet he's sleeping in.

70
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,276
Sleeping in?

71
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,695
Oh, no.

72
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,864
He's either dead or kidnapped.

73
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,424
I finished it, so she can go, right?

74
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,803
I like you enough to get angry

75
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,262
if someone...

76
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,807
insults you.

77
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,483
Bullshit.

78
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,027
Feet.

79
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,572
Why did you go to her?

80
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,368
Hand, why did you reach out to her?

81
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,454
My head,

82
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,833
why do you keep worrying about her?

83
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:58,669
The mat?

84
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,172
Right?

85
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,590
You bought my mat.

86
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,676
-Who are you?
-Cho Ji-oh.

87
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,686
I really like this,
but I'll sell it to you.

88
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,312
For 5,000 won.

89
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,523
-Where am I?
-My aunt's room.

90
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,234
Why am I in your aunt's room?

91
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,070
Auntie carried you here yesterday.

92
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,573
She's really strong.

93
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,827
What's with this lame shirt?

94
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,078
Did I vomit?

95
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,038
Did I?

96
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:40,335
Mom gave you honey water, but
you spat it out because it was too sweet.

97
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,674
Okay.

98
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,968
I'll buy that.

99
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,511
Really?

100
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,182
In return, check if your aunt's out there.

101
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,309
If you help me leave secretly,

102
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,439
this is all yours.

103
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,065
Okay.

104
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,241
-She's not here.
-Okay.

105
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,998
I told you.

106
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,791
She's not here.

107
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,172
But everyone else is.

108
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,429
Oh, good morning.

109
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,473
You're up.

110
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,184
Get washed and come eat.

111
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:56,203
You're A-jung's brother-in-law.
I hope the food will suit your taste buds.

112
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,331
Thanks, but I'm not her brother-in-law.

113
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,166
Pardon?

114
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,168
They aren't married yet.

115
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,254
Oh, right.

116
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,506
You're the one who was carried here

117
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,133
when you're not even our in-law yet.

118
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,598
It's salty.

119
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,184
-Oh, I...
-Hey.

120
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:23,605
We all have to leave now,
so take your time with the food.

121
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,690
We're leaving?

122
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,441
-Yes, well...
-Right now?

123
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,651
-Honey?
-Ji-oh.

124
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,860
-Ji-oh.
-Come on.

125
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,239
-What?
-Let's talk outside.

126
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,621
We had to leave?

127
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,916
Why did you have to say that?

128
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,627
We got kicked out of our own house.

129
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,921
I didn't know what else to do.

130
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,383
By the way,
are my dishes salty these days?

131
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,512
I should have added less salt in the soup.

132
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,515
No, he would've just said
it was too bland.

133
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,475
He just doesn't like

134
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,227
our entire family.

135
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,146
But I like him.

136
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,941
Remember how he came all dressed up

137
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,027
and dragged A-jung away?

138
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,738
The thing is,

139
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,199
the fiesty A-jung
got in his car without protest.

140
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,744
-She did?
-Really? Just like that?

141
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,245
Yes.

142
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:24,374
She must feel insecure
since she's marrying into a rich family.

143
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,504
Her future brother-in-law's
going to be trouble.

144
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:34,176
It seems like he's pushing her around
even before the marriage.

145
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,802
-Right?
-Yes.

146
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,889
He seems like a decent boy,

147
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,017
but I guess he's the opposite
of his brother.

148
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,602
Mother.

149
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:48,607
They say you should judge
a person by the light in their eyes.

150
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,735
But his eyes didn't look very good.

151
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,197
They're big, but they seem too aggressive.

152
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,034
There are stories about animals

153
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,788
repaying people who helped them,

154
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,791
but why are you so ungrateful?

155
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,251
What about you, then?

156
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,297
This is kidnapping, you know.

157
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,967
I woke up in a flower-patterned bed
and got scammed by a kid.

158
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,639
I didn't call the cops on you
only because I got a warm meal.

159
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,852
Don't you remember?

160
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,400
You don't.

161
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:35,028
I guess you have a bad memory.

162
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,989
What do you mean?

163
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,951
I took you out of the hotel

164
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,745
and apologized. That's it.

165
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,248
I recorded everything, just in case.

166
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,961
Evidence number one.

167
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,130
Here.

168
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,923
Get out.

169
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,259
Get out, this isn't your car!

170
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,100
Re-enter the passcode.

171
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,476
Jeez.

172
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,812
Are you looking down on me too?

173
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,730
Open up, all right?

174
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,820
Re-enter the passcode.

175
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,619
Oh, this is a club.

176
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,290
Beep, beep, beep.

177
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,171
Ji-oh, can you film us?

178
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,380
The mat guy?

179
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,674
-Mom!
-What...

180
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,217
-Take him.
-Oh, my gosh.

181
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,802
What's he doing here?

182
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,554
-Honey.
-Open the door.

183
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,310
No! I hate sweets!

184
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,020
Gosh. We should change him.

185
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,813
This must be expensive.

186
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,981
-Mom.
-Hey.

187
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,108
Stop filming and wipe this.

188
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,903
He's your brother-in-law.

189
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,239
This is uncomfortable.
I don't want to wear this!

190
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,533
He must be crazy!

191
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,039
Is your conscience coming back now?

192
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,123
What was that?

193
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,668
Give me that.

194
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,962
Give it to me.

195
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,965
If it weren't for me,

196
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:24,888
you would've slept on the streets
near the hotel and embarrassed yourself.

197
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,098
And your grandpa would've heard.

198
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,976
It would've been better
to die on the streets.

199
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,937
You blackmailer.

200
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,315
Blackmail's your specialty.

201
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,858
I'm negotiating.

202
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,196
I'll delete it

203
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,157
if you admit it.

204
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,283
Admit what?

205
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,244
That I won't fall for you

206
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,079
or anyone else.

207
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,582
I went to Busan and went on a blind date.

208
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,002
I've already cooperated with you enough.

209
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,505
-So it's your turn.
-And if I say no?

210
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,383
Then I have no choice.

211
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,721
I have lots of evidence,
so I'll go and tell Do-han everything.

212
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,058
Telling on me?

213
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,604
I bet you can't.
Because I'll get rid of the evidence.

214
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,470
You like me enough

215
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,391
to get upset when I'm insulted.

216
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,104
So why don't you just let us
get married now?

217
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,860
Then I'll like you a bit more too.

218
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,089
EPISODE 5

219
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,685
Give me your phone.

220
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,728
What?

221
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,229
Why?

222
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,490
Your phone's fine,

223
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,949
and you look fine too.

224
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,868
What happened yesterday?

225
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,953
You know

226
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,998
I always have a lot to say.

227
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,377
But I have nothing to say today.

228
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,464
Go on. You can scold me.

229
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,717
You didn't pick up
until the district office closed,

230
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:12,013
then you called me many times
but didn't pick up when I called back.

231
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:13,723
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,893
I couldn't reach you,
and my studio was a mess.

233
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,145
I was so worried.

234
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,564
What about your studio?

235
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,359
Did something happen?

236
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,320
Let's talk about it inside for a moment.

237
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,115
No, talk here.

238
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,741
Just talk here.

239
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,995
He could've just called.

240
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,331
Why is he here so early?

241
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,880
-A-jung.
-Yes?

242
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,633
I wasn't joking about our marriage.

243
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,843
I know.

244
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,345
If you can't be reached, it's a breach...

245
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,016
What's she doing?
Why's she stopping him from talking?

246
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,102
I know.

247
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,272
I promise it won't happen again.

248
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,524
-So you're okay?
-Yes.

249
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,526
That's a relief.

250
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,573
-Someone's been in my studio.
-What?

251
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,700
Our plane tickets were ripped.

252
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,952
We should be careful.

253
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,912
Did you report it?

254
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,333
-I don't want more trouble.
-Still, you should report it.

255
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,918
Don't be ridiculous.

256
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,712
We can get the tickets again.

257
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,214
And we're going to New York.

258
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,049
New York?

259
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,384
We're leaving soon.

260
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,594
We should lie low

261
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,345
so no one will find out.

262
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,430
Right.

263
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,684
I thought something happened
because of our marriage register.

264
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,811
I was so worried.

265
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,563
What was that?

266
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,946
Going to New York?

267
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,742
Marriage register?

268
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,410
Why are you here?

269
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,224
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,810
Min-woong's still immature.

271
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,022
He must've been upset
after getting scolded by you.

272
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,525
You don't need to apologize for him.

273
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,447
I know you've been cleaning up
Min-woong's messes. You can stop.

274
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,658
You knew?

275
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,036
Then why do you want Do-han to take over?

276
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,164
Grandpa.

277
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,042
Why don't you let me do it?

278
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,586
I can do a good job.

279
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,130
I'm not like Min-woong or my father.

280
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,635
If I ever disappointed you, I'll fix it,

281
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,928
whatever it is.

282
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,306
I can do a really good job.

283
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,852
I'm glad to hear that.

284
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,228
Yes.

285
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,814
Then with that passion of yours,

286
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,108
help Do-han.

287
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,530
The one thing
I'm disappointed in you about

288
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,325
is that you don't accept them
as your brothers.

289
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,203
They're the only ones I can't accept.

290
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,372
And

291
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,624
I thought you were

292
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,835
thinking the same thing until now.

293
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,510
I believe in you.

294
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,637
You can do a good job.

295
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,765
Take your time.

296
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,735
I'm still better than you.

297
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,861
Are you kidding?

298
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,945
Hey.

299
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,407
Isn't that Director Han
from Jangsan Home Shopping

300
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,326
and Ms. Yoon from Taeyang Products?

301
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,202
You're right.

302
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,748
-The same one, please.
-What's going on?

303
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,126
I didn't think you'd come.

304
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,047
Then why did you send
someone else yesterday

305
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,715
instead of coming?

306
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,343
I don't make my secretary work
on weekends.

307
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,429
But you did,
and so early in the morning at that.

308
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,222
Is that so? Sorry.

309
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,516
But I heard it then

310
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,019
that you intercepted our M&A.

311
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,481
Oh, so you were just late
to hear the news.

312
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,733
We finished that during the week.

313
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,072
There are rumors
about you marrying Lee Do-han.

314
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,074
You need that for your dowry?

315
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,909
Don't be silly.

316
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,244
I don't need a dowry,

317
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:51,042
even if I marry someone
other than the one from the rumors.

318
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,421
Unless it's a voluntary gift
I'm preparing.

319
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,131
"Someone other"?

320
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,591
"Gift"?

321
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,554
A gift for whom?

322
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,101
When she looked at Do-han,
her eyes had no sparkles.

323
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:12,772
So who would she have feelings for
between those two?

324
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,691
No way!

325
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,817
Are you okay?

326
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,819
-Hey, don't...
-Hey.

327
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:24,033
You said you didn't expect me to come.
I didn't come just because you asked.

328
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,077
I was just curious.

329
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,037
Who was it?

330
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,331
The one who came to meet you

331
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,125
instead of me yesterday?

332
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:33,960
Honey!

333
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,712
Honey.

334
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,630
Honey.

335
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,300
This is huge.

336
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,385
What...

337
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,804
What's with your pants?

338
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,556
Did you wet yourself?

339
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,891
I think you were right.

340
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,977
Yoon Chae-won must have a crush

341
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,146
on Ji-han, not Do-han!

342
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,138
Na A-jung?

343
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,390
She's an unknown actress.

344
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,642
Didn't Ji-han tell you?

345
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,687
Na A-jung?

346
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:38,816
Oh, my gosh.

347
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,026
That was Na A-jung?

348
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,110
Yes.

349
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,114
Ji-han's really unbelievable.

350
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,910
How could he send his future
sister-in-law there?

351
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,536
He must be crazy!

352
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,372
So? So what happened? Spill.

353
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,167
This isn't the time to be all excited.

354
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,295
That greedy bastard
is trying to get rid of her

355
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,131
and set Do-han up with Chae-won.

356
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:05,760
He doesn't seem to know she likes him.
But if he does,

357
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,513
he'll get his hands on Taeyang.

358
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,181
If they get married...

359
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,142
we're really doomed.

360
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,436
You're right.

361
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,815
But Ji-han has a girlfriend.

362
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,402
You said your employee saw them together
at the Busan LJ Hotel.

363
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,695
What do you mean?

364
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,197
Ji-han has a girlfriend?

365
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,992
Tell me.

366
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,288
What brings you here?
I thought you had other ideas.

367
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,791
What was that about a blind date?

368
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,001
Answer me, Se-jin.

369
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,714
This is my house.

370
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,883
I have the authority in here.

371
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,635
If you don't agree,

372
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,846
then go somewhere else.

373
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,140
Honey, let's go to our room,

374
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:56,185
lock the door, and talk quietly
so no one can hear us.

375
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,103
Okay.

376
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,396
What is it?

377
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,605
You should knock.

378
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,571
Okay.

379
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,955
The worst crime to commit

380
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,832
is getting caught.

381
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,584
But you ditch me like that?

382
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,130
Am I the only one who got caught?

383
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,843
What were you doing in A-jung's house?

384
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,803
You did something worse.

385
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,014
Anyway, just tell me.

386
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,851
What was all that I heard?

387
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,021
Do you know why I'm marrying her?

388
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,648
Because I'm sick

389
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,611
of making excuses to everyone.

390
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,449
He's gotten

391
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,327
shameless just like that woman.

392
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,717
Fine, I'll just tell you.
I'm leaving with A-jung.

393
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,927
No.

394
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,554
And we're registering our marriage too.

395
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:14,639
You can't.

396
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,601
I don't need your permission.
We agreed to do it.

397
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:19,977
What about LJ?

398
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,272
-And me?
-Why do you

399
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,899
keep asking me that?

400
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,984
I'm not your dad.

401
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,986
I'm just your brother.

402
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:33,366
I'm not even sure about my life,
but you and the company?

403
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,408
Do-han.

404
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:35,910
You know,

405
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,497
whenever you depend on me,
I feel suffocated.

406
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,876
I just want to breathe,
and A-jung helps me do that.

407
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,838
You have no right to oppose her.

408
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,383
I can't even do that?

409
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,551
I'm your brother.

410
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,223
I'll stop asking

411
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:02,520
why you were at that house
and what happened between you two.

412
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,984
But this is my last warning.
Don't you dare touch her.

413
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,363
And if I do?

414
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,617
What then?

415
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,496
I'm cutting ties.

416
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,748
What?

417
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:27,461
You hate me for not listening to you,
and I'd hate you for not respecting me.

418
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,213
What else can we do?

419
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,551
You'll cut ties?

420
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,347
You'd rather do that
than break the marriage off?

421
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,224
Yes.

422
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,773
Grandpa gave us permission.

423
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,150
Why are you opposing?

424
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,445
You're crossing the line, Ji-han.

425
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,926
This looks delicious.

426
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,429
Let's eat.

427
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,223
I'm sure you already heard,

428
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,728
but I thought I should meet you
in person and apologize.

429
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,983
I pushed you to marry Do-han

430
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,318
this whole time,

431
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,613
but I allowed him to marry someone else.

432
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,908
I'm sorry about that.

433
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,119
I know why you're telling me this.

434
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,498
You want me to help Do-han
even if we don't marry, right?

435
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,625
I'm grateful you understand

436
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,335
what I mean.

437
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,922
I know you wanted me
as your granddaughter-in-law.

438
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:57,385
And I believe you're a bit disappointed
that it didn't work.

439
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,469
Not just a bit.

440
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,804
A lot.

441
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:03,974
But what can I do?

442
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,184
I can't force him

443
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,228
to break up with a girl he loves.

444
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,232
So I want to make a suggestion.

445
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:12,858
Yes?

446
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,652
Give me

447
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,736
Ji-han.

448
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,292
What should I do

449
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,546
to make them crumble down together?

450
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,970
Article 840 of the Civil Act states

451
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,722
that you can apply for divorce

452
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:47,518
if you're maltreated
by your spouse's family as well.

453
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,103
And "maltreated" includes

454
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,939
abusive language, assault,
excessive meddling,

455
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,651
and bullying, which your future
brother-in-law is doing.

456
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,320
How do you know that so well?

457
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,364
I used to play a role

458
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,657
in Love and War.

459
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,451
-Oh, right.
-Anyway,

460
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,453
I'd get pissed too

461
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:09,623
if my brother came out
of my future wife's house.

462
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:13,377
But what if your brother
was going to register his marriage

463
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,879
and flee the country?

464
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,173
-What?
-Whose side are you on?

465
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,176
Your future husband or brother-in-law?

466
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,052
Hey, that's childish.

467
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:27,099
I'm just worried that their relationship
might be ruined because of me.

468
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,768
Come on, that's not your fault.

469
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,645
Right.

470
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,355
Just forget it.

471
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,275
Worrying won't change anything.

472
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,568
Right.

473
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,822
He can't do anything about your marriage
if you just ignore him.

474
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,366
We're not even married yet,

475
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,119
but it's exhausting already.

476
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,955
And why do I feel so uneasy

477
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:51,832
watching him?

478
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,628
Then how about making him support you?

479
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,379
-Support me?
-Yes.

480
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,174
Make your future brother-in-law like you.

481
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,302
He was drunk,
but he did say he liked you a bit.

482
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,138
Didn't I tell you several times

483
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,183
that what you say
when you're drunk is nonsense?

484
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,227
Well, even if that's true,

485
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,521
you should use this opportunity.

486
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,231
You're great at it.

487
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,484
Remember when you humored
that scumbag director

488
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,028
and got everything you wanted from him?

489
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,698
If he loves his brother that much,

490
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,534
he'll support you

491
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,953
when you get on his good side.

492
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,506
You know,

493
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,218
whenever you depend on me,
I feel suffocated.

494
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,805
I just want to breathe,
and A-jung helps me do that.

495
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,234
Mr. Lee?

496
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,654
You have the files
on the shopping mall, right?

497
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,030
Mr. Eun wants it.

498
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,199
Okay.

499
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,374
He's sighed 24 times already.

500
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,294
He's been spacing out and acting weird.

501
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,963
What if something happened to him?

502
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,805
Stay still!

503
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,351
Were you kidnapped
and locked up somewhere?

504
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,187
Or did you hurt your head?

505
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,897
No,

506
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,610
did you fall and lose consciousness?

507
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,486
I would've preferred that.

508
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,363
Physical pain

509
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,741
hurts less than a heartache.

510
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:55,289
Then how come I couldn't reach you
during the entire weekend?

511
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,999
It's all your fault.

512
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,504
Your words were following my ears
like some ghost.

513
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,218
What words do you mean?

514
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:09,928
It was

515
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,891
a mistake trying to seduce A-jung.

516
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,018
While I wasted my time,

517
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,939
Do-han was planning on registering
their marriage and fleeing to New York.

518
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,943
He can't go to New York.

519
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,195
Or get married.

520
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,988
You think I don't know that?

521
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:29,948
No, I mean

522
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,661
it seems the shopping mall business
will resume soon.

523
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,080
What?

524
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:37,998
What did you say?

525
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,875
According to Mr. Kim,

526
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:44,004
the chairman had dinner
with Ms. Yoon alone a few days ago.

527
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:49,968
It seems Ms. Yoon's taking things
into her own hands this time.

528
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,846
But if he gets married and flees...

529
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,352
The shopping mall will be a flop,

530
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,106
and Chae-won and Do-han will be ruined.

531
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,278
There are a few security cams nearby,

532
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:12,741
but we can't check them because of
the Personal Information Protection Act.

533
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,869
I think it'll be best
to report it to the police.

534
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,789
Then you can check them.

535
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,625
No, it's fine.

536
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,670
I set up a security device. It'll be okay.

537
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,463
But still,

538
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,799
this could cause more trouble.

539
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,176
Mr. Kim.

540
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,345
Could I ask you a favor?

541
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,098
A favor?

542
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,070
I wrote down five lucky days

543
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:53,407
around the period you mentioned.

544
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,703
And 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
is best for all of them.

545
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,581
I'll keep that in mind.

546
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,875
-All done, sir?
-Yes.

547
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,501
Here.

548
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,712
-Choose one of these.
-Yes, sir.

549
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,631
I'll report the guest list to you

550
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,342
as soon as the secretary team is done.

551
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,469
All right.

552
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,054
And there's something else.

553
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,598
What is it?

554
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,768
We'll do our best to stop any articles,

555
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:24,772
but we prepared a press release
about Ms. Na just in case.

556
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:28,358
But Do-han seems to want
to change all of it.

557
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:31,820
All of it?

558
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,363
Why?

559
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:37,701
What's there to change?
Isn't it just facts about her?

560
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,953
Yes, it is.

561
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,038
Then why?

562
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,333
He doesn't seem to like it.

563
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,212
He said that if any info about her
must be released,

564
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,381
she should seem like
a completely different person

565
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:55,594
so that people won't be able
to figure out who she is.

566
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,806
He said that would prevent her

567
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,058
from being slandered by everyone.

568
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,019
He must be worried about her

569
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,314
being exposed to the public.

570
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,118
Hey, it's been a while.

571
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,872
I'm fine.

572
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,000
Well...

573
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,129
Are you still in touch with Dae-hyeon?

574
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,513
-Let me go in too.
-What?

575
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,227
He's taking everything, isn't he?

576
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,145
I guess LJ's ruined.

577
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,274
Selecting him as a model employee.

578
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,525
MODEL EMPLOYEE LEE JI-HAN

579
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,778
I'll just get married quietly,

580
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,738
so please,

581
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,491
just be a model brother-in-law.

582
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,621
-Can we help you?
-Oh, hello.

583
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,999
Is Mr. Lee Ji-han here?

584
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,459
He's working at the department store.

585
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,086
I see.

586
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,089
Then I can meet him if I go there?

587
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,716
-Yes.
-Thank you.

588
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,137
-Is she his girlfriend?
-No way.

589
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,139
She doesn't suit Mr. Lee at all.

590
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,309
Why did Ji-han have to

591
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,978
leave his clothes at my house?

592
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,813
What a hassle.

593
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,524
She is.

594
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,277
If he left his clothes there,
it's obvious.

595
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,364
No way.

596
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,123
You must be so sorry.

597
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,417
Why are you so quiet?

598
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,294
Don't laugh.

599
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:56,340
You're making me feel more guilty
by being nice.

600
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,549
Guilty about what?

601
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,177
Leaving during dinner?

602
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,596
Or making me wait at the hotel?

603
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,764
No.

604
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,058
Not being able to help you.

605
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,227
I heard you're helping

606
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,939
with our shopping mall.

607
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,983
I didn't know.

608
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,362
I was doing stupid things.

609
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,323
I heard Na A-jung

610
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,492
went on the blind date.

611
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,286
-You heard?
-I saw the two of you

612
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,704
in front of the hotel.

613
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:30,749
What's going on?

614
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,252
Weren't you on bad terms?
You seemed close.

615
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,214
We seemed close? She and I?

616
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,883
Yes. To be honest, it made me jealous.

617
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:45,013
I thought you only laughed with me,
but you were laughing with her.

618
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,807
I laughed? With her?

619
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,891
Yes.

620
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,019
So I even did a background check.

621
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,982
I got so curious
that I did something so pathetic.

622
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,860
No need to be jealous or curious.

623
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,989
You shouldn't feel pathetic
over someone like her.

624
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,199
What kind of girl is she?

625
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,327
Well...

626
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,750
A habitual blackmailer
who's shameless and coercive.

627
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,546
Blackmail's your specialty.
I'm negotiating.

628
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,758
And she's a woman of no pride

629
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:26,555
who's okay with getting insulted
as long as she gets free food or drinks.

630
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,516
I don't care what strangers say.

631
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,936
I ate delicious food
and got expensive drinks for free.

632
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,940
There was no loss for me.
But it's different for you.

633
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:38,942
Are you

634
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,320
angry because of that?

635
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,699
But she keeps her pride
for useless things.

636
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,660
She's so inconsistent.

637
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,706
Who are you to make me have such regrets?

638
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,417
What makes you really awful

639
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,920
is that you made me hate myself, not you.

640
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,505
You know that?

641
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,216
Anyway,

642
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,135
there isn't a single thing

643
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,762
I can like about her.

644
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,390
I like you enough to get angry...

645
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,560
I hate her enough to dance happily...

646
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,562
...if someone

647
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,108
insults you.

648
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,487
...if someone insults her.

649
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,077
So don't worry about her,

650
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,037
and keep going forward.

651
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,916
I hope you achieve what you want.

652
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:45,967
Add one more.

653
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,262
Someone you'll never speak to again.

654
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,317
What is this?

655
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:06,321
Are you stalking me?
Why were you eavesdropping?

656
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,075
What is it?
Are you threatening me to get my approval?

657
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,911
Or was that a protest
to show you were hurt?

658
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,831
I guess I'm a villain to you.

659
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,917
Did that seem like
threatening and protesting?

660
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,003
But thank you.

661
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,298
I was confused because of my role,

662
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,134
but now I know.

663
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:32,139
If I'm going to be treated like a villain,
I'll be a proper villain.

664
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,309
I'm not kind to people
who won't understand me.

665
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:40,021
That's what I was hoping for.
If that's who you really are,

666
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,314
then be honest.

667
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,191
Don't confuse people.

668
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,860
What confused you?

669
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,571
You never got confused about me.

670
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,657
You always hated me.

671
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,246
So keep doing that. It'll be easier
for me to play the villain.

672
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,376
Hey.

673
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,798
There isn't anything
you can like about me?

674
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,386
That's great.
I don't need to be liked by you.

675
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,889
And how old are you?

676
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,225
You're still wet behind the ears.

677
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,936
How dare you be so rude to me?

678
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,606
Watch your mouth, okay?

679
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,444
I'm letting you off
only because you're Do-han's brother.

680
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,328
Letting me off? What can you even do?

681
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:40,957
Does she think I'll get scared?
And I'm letting you off too!

682
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:44,294
I've been letting you off this whole time!

683
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,930
What's wrong? Aren't you hungry?

684
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,431
How about a walk?

685
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,100
What is it?

686
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,810
Do you want food or a walk?

687
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,439
It's no use.

688
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,443
I'm going to stick to the path I choose.

689
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,614
So choose yours too. Is it food or a walk?

690
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,748
Do I seem like a villain to you too?

691
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,337
Do-han's on her side,

692
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,256
and my dog is too.

693
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,509
She must be happy.

694
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,975
So, why did you want to meet me,

695
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,060
Ms. Choi?

696
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,898
I want you to investigate
the girl my younger brother's seeing.

697
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,192
You have two.

698
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:50,652
Which one?

699
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,404
Do-han or Ji-han?

700
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,447
Do-han.

701
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,036
But I believe
the girl's involved with Ji-han as well.

702
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,914
You wrote a wrong article.

703
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,294
The one Do-han's marrying isn't

704
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,088
Chae-won of Taeyang Group.

705
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,799
It's her.

706
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,177
Na A-jung.

707
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,263
Mr. Kang.

708
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,724
Can you write something

709
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,686
interesting about her and my brothers?

710
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:30,400
If you make a good story,
it will benefit the both of us.

711
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:03,850
Hello?

712
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,187
Oh, yes. Hello.

713
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,524
When's the date?

714
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,485
I see.

715
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,695
I really appreciate it,

716
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,615
but I have other plans that day.

717
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,660
I know it's a great opportunity.

718
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,496
Yes.

719
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,247
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:27,999
Sorry. Bye.

721
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,668
What are you apologizing for?

722
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,337
An audition offer.

723
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,008
A-jung.

724
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,386
Did you just turn it down?

725
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,557
You went to an audition
even after an appendix surgery.

726
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:49,854
Is this because you're marrying
into a rich family now?

727
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,857
Is that it?

728
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,317
Is that true?

729
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,489
Or... Wait. Did they tell you not to act?

730
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,282
It's not that.

731
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,452
I just can't that day.

732
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,372
I have to act somewhere else.

733
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,754
She was waiting for the weekend.

734
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,423
-What...
-Our in-laws.

735
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,299
Choi Min-woong of LJ Hotel

736
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,718
and Choi Seung-a of LJ Department Store

737
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,805
started volunteer work this morning.

738
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,809
It seems this has been decided in place

739
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,896
of a memorial service for their mother,
the late CEO Hyun Su-hyeon.

740
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,773
Song In-hye reports.

741
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,483
LJ CHOI SEUNG-A GIVES SCHOLARSHIP

742
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,861
-Did you wait long?
-No.

743
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,779
That's good.

744
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:40,864
Let's go.

745
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,491
You can still back out.

746
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,535
No, it's fine.

747
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,913
I wanted to meet your mother.

748
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:50,623
Let's go.

749
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,042
We can go there

750
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,587
quietly alone next time.

751
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,671
It's fine.

752
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,012
It's not dangerous.
Stop the fuss and get in.

753
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,391
It's okay.

754
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:13,938
What?

755
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:15,940
Another warning?

756
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,277
I can't say anything in front of you.

757
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,294
Do-han.

758
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:37,837
Isn't this weird?

759
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,089
Her joining our family event.

760
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:41,508
Isn't it too early?

761
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,135
You're not even married yet.

762
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,599
Do-han. Why is your brother
always picking a fight?

763
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:50,683
It really puts me off.

764
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,145
Did she and I ever get
close enough to say that?

765
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:57,357
We're just strangers,
and she gets put off?

766
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,151
-Ji-han.
-What? Another warning?

767
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,029
She's the one who crossed the line.

768
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,199
This is so unfair.

769
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,744
I can't play if the referee is so biased.

770
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,371
Stop it.

771
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:12,705
No, don't stop him.

772
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,916
Tell him to keep going.

773
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,920
It's better to get badmouthed here
than behind my back.

774
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,673
What did you just say?

775
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:25,218
Do-han, what's the worst thing
you've heard about you?

776
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,386
A-jung...

777
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:31,516
I heard that they hated me
enough to dance if someone insulted me.

778
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,601
Talk about inconsistency.

779
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:37,605
After saying they liked me enough
to get upset if I was insulted.

780
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,569
Let's be quiet.

781
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,614
I don't want to get stressed
while going to see our mother.

782
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:53,204
I'm not sure whether
you're fighting or getting closer.

783
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:04,215
SUNLIGHT MEMORIAL HALL

784
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:09,596
Grandpa.

785
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,433
You came just in time.

786
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,770
Chae-won, what are you doing here?

787
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,440
I invited her. She's my guest.

788
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,740
What are you waiting for? Let's go in.

789
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,040
THE LATE HYUN SU-HYEON

790
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,436
A-jung.

791
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,146
Come here.

792
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:06,778
Say hello.

793
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,864
She'll be your daughter-in-law.

794
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:15,536
She seems to care for Do-han a lot,
so I gave them permission in your place.

795
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,667
She's here to greet you.

796
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,763
A reporter must have come

797
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:39,268
looking into the truth about the daughter
of a wealthy family who disappeared.

798
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,438
Ji-han probably

799
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,774
had no idea

800
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,652
who his mother really was.

801
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:04,585
Hey, kid.

802
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,504
Who are you?

803
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,214
Your mom's Hyun Su-hyeon, right?

804
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,216
Do you know my mom?

805
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,592
Of course.

806
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,511
I'm her friend.

807
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,306
It's pouring. Let's go home, shall we?

808
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,768
How could an eight-year-old have known?

809
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,856
He said he was his mom's friend
and offered to walk him home.

810
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,442
So he said yes.

811
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,862
It was pouring that night.

812
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,323
She had that accident
while trying to avoid the reporter.

813
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,877
-Su-hyeon...
-The chairman still doesn't get

814
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,546
why he made that choice.

815
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,631
Su-hyeon!

816
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,676
-Su-hyeon...
-One thing for sure

817
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:57,722
is that he still regrets
the choice he made.

818
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:07,732
That must've been terrible
for Ji-han as well as his grandfather.

819
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:10,943
That's why Ji-han

820
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:14,781
still hates the rain so much.

821
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:19,035
I guess it reminds him of that day.

822
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,978
Why's she looking at me like that?
So dreary.

823
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,315
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

824
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,275
-Did you hear?
-What?

825
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,905
Chae-won's been helping
with resuming our shopping mall business.

826
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:00,034
I guess authority is the most powerful,

827
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,495
not violence.

828
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,373
Ji-han, you don't need to
talk about work here.

829
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,707
No, I heard.

830
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,879
I didn't think you'd keep
your promise so quickly.

831
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:12,964
Thank you.

832
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,340
Promise?

833
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,760
Did you make a promise with him?
What is it?

834
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,598
All right, it's my turn
to keep my promise now.

835
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,143
That's why I asked you to join us.

836
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:33,234
You must've asked for something big.

837
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:34,777
Chae-won.

838
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,405
Whatever it is, you'll get it.

839
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,616
Grandpa always keeps his word.

840
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,582
Grandfather.

841
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,167
Would you like to see a video?

842
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,503
-A video?
-Yes.

843
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,340
I actually took a video of you and Do-han

844
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,801
as you were walking a while ago.

845
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,052
Really?

846
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:06,475
I have a habit of recording moments

847
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,561
that I don't want to forget.

848
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,231
This is nice.

849
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,483
This is the last one.

850
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,820
You can swipe left and see the others.

851
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:18,905
In reverse order.

852
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:24,118
-Can you send me this?
-Sure.

853
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,120
You have a talent for this.

854
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:27,955
Sir.

855
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:31,500
The car's ready.

856
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,960
All right, let's go.

857
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:36,839
Can you show me
if you take any other fun videos?

858
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:37,924
Of course.

859
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,927
I have lots of interesting videos
in my phone.

860
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,554
Let's go.

861
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,358
I told you not to show it to anyone.

862
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,069
Shut your mouth before I release it.

863
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:00,863
Right.

864
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,490
Ji-han.

865
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:07,453
Get in my car with Chae-won.

866
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,498
-Me?
-Don't you want to?

867
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,042
It's not that...

868
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,794
Come to think of it,

869
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:19,131
I've never spent time alone
with Ji-han before.

870
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,176
Let's go together and have dinner.

871
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,221
I also have something to say.
Is that okay?

872
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,597
Yes.

873
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,015
And you?

874
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,600
I'd love that.

875
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,644
All right, then. Let's go.

876
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,609
I knew it.

877
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,195
This is your car, Mr. Hyun.

878
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,909
Oh, you came with your grandsons.
How nice.

879
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,747
You're here too, Ms. Yoon.
Did you like the photos I took?

880
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:52,832
That's enough.

881
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,710
What are you doing here?

882
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,839
You know,
I came to pay my respects to Ms. Hyun,

883
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:03,259
and I thought I'd find something
to write about.

884
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:08,222
Everyone wants to write about Do-han,
but they don't have any info.

885
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,518
Oh, right. Look.

886
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:15,771
Maybe it's my age.

887
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:20,484
It throbs here whenever it rains.
I can't run around investigating anymore.

888
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:24,280
Oh, right. What about you?

889
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,490
How's the injury from back then?

890
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,285
How dare you come here doing this?

891
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,413
-How dare you?
-Grandpa.

892
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,622
You bastard!

893
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,416
-Grandpa.
-Let go!

894
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,961
I have a right to be here.
I'm a victim too.

895
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:43,257
So answer my calls!
Or I have no choice but to come find you!

896
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,217
A-jung.

897
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,181
By the way, who is she?

898
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,059
Ji-han, take care of A-jung.

899
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,460
I'm okay, so focus on driving.

900
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,755
So you're not okay.

901
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,716
If you say you're okay, you're not.

902
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,297
What are you doing?

903
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,590
Slow down.

904
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:10,094
Don't you see that car following us?
We must speed up.

905
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,680
But this is the wrong way.

906
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,014
Where are we going?

907
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,724
I'm the driver. Trust me.

908
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,810
Just hold on to the handle.

909
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,520
Searching new route.

910
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,490
A-jung!

911
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,623
A-jung, stop!

912
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,430
Please, stop!

913
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,105
Hi, it's Reporter Kang Ik-jun.

914
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,440
Yes.

915
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,985
I'll accept the offer you made last time.

916
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,697
This is more interesting than I thought.

917
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,742
The brothers

918
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,369
and the girl named Na A-jung.

919
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,424
What?

920
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,803
We lost the reporter thanks to me.

921
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:40,184
If I hadn't done that,
he would've started another fight.

922
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,269
The second fight was in the car.

923
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,272
You know how many times I hit my head?

924
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:03,249
Happy now?

925
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,334
What was that?

926
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,379
What do you think? I was comforting you.

927
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,421
So why?

928
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,175
Normally, you would've thrown
curses at me.

929
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,306
You were hurt

930
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,309
when your grandpa

931
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,311
pushed you away like this.

932
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:27,856
I don't want to

933
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,693
trample on your feelings any further.

934
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,284
And I don't want to console you
when I don't know everything.

935
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,494
Or interfere when it's not my place.

936
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,291
But I think I can listen

937
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:51,088
to your whining and grumbling.
Things like that.

938
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,593
So you can tell me everything.

939
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:59,555
I'll listen and forget about it all.

940
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,766
Did I tell you? I'm good at that.

941
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,448
How's your stomach?

942
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:22,328
Should I ask for more water?

943
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,290
No, it's fine.

944
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,169
Let's get some fresh air.

945
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,701
What were you doing there that day?

946
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,456
I'm sure you didn't come
to hear me badmouth you.

947
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:09,958
I'm surprised.

948
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,545
You know that, but you haven't apologized.

949
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,342
I went there to make you like me.

950
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,513
Someone told me

951
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,974
that since you love your brother so much,

952
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:29,186
you'll support our marriage
if I get you to like me.

953
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,817
You always seem to try the impossible.

954
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:39,822
I said it before,
but you seem really ambitious.

955
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:46,620
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about New York
and registering our marriage.

956
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,625
Like you say, I might not

957
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:54,878
be the best partner for Do-han.

958
01:01:56,296 --> 01:02:01,176
But if he's with me, he won't have to
suffer living a life he doesn't want.

959
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:06,140
If I'm getting married anyway,
I want to do it with everyone's blessing.

960
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,476
I don't even wish for you to like me.

961
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,979
Just keep an eye on us.

962
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,524
I'll be really good to Do-han.

963
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:23,532
How is he?

964
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,534
He just fell asleep.

965
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,245
No need to see me out.

966
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:33,500
It has to do with Ji-han, right?
That promise you made.

967
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:42,426
Let me ask that question once more.

968
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,928
Do you have feelings for Ji-han?

969
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,558
Did Grandpa promise to give you Ji-han?

970
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,686
Did you seriously

971
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,481
make a deal over him?

972
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:57,316
Yes, I did.

973
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,234
Can't I do that?

974
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,821
Of course not. Ji-han doesn't know.

975
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,866
You should've at least asked him first.

976
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:06,950
Do-han.

977
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,204
You know how contradictory that is, right?

978
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,083
You're the one who's
always deciding things without asking him.

979
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:18,754
Don't worry.

980
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,631
I'm going to tell him.

981
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,799
I don't want him to get hurt too.

982
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,927
I care about him too.

983
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,261
And if he says no?

984
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,138
You said I was his first love.

985
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:31,558
I've always been his ideal type.

986
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:32,768
You know that.

987
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,103
His feelings won't suddenly disappear

988
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,022
or pass on

989
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,107
to someone else.

990
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,901
Bye, then.

991
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:06,760
Where are we going?

992
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,445
THE LATE HYUN SU-HYEON

993
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,451
I'm sorry I lied.

994
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,622
I may be a fake daughter-in-law,

995
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:39,001
but I'll take good care of your son.

996
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,755
So don't worry about him.

997
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,604
You're crazy, Ji-han.

998
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,398
You've gone crazy.

999
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,673
I thought you hated rain.

1000
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:42,833
EPILOGUE

1001
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:56,638
Hey.

1002
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,265
Han Yeong-hun.

1003
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,559
You jerk. Apologize.

1004
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,896
What about my mom?

1005
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:51,818
Apologize

1006
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,322
to A-jung.

1007
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,550
