1
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,893
The reason I'm here today

2
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,020
is to apologize

3
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,398
and correct something that's false.

4
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,902
The scandal about my brother,

5
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,197
his fiancée,

6
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,450
and me

7
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,744
is not true.

8
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,790
She did nothing wrong.

9
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,210
I was the one chasing after her.

10
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,547
The only fact about the scandal

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,424
is...

12
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,260
that I like her.

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,846
I really care for her.

14
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:39,767
That's all.

15
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:43,896
That is...

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,568
the only truth.

17
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,030
I'm telling my last lie.

18
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm sorry I broke my promise

19
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,536
to be honest.

20
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,498
Everything else is
nothing but mere speculation

21
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,792
or a rumor.

22
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,086
She never betrayed my brother

23
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,463
or had feelings for me.

24
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,800
You're lying.

25
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,264
-A-jung!
-A-jung.

26
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,723
-A-jung!
-A-jung!

27
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,228
But I have no regrets.

28
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,898
Even if no one else does,

29
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,027
it's fine as long as you know how I feel.

30
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,240
I can give up everything...

31
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,203
as long as I can protect you.

32
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,634
You can hate me for making this decision.

33
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,139
Just don't feel sorry.

34
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,614
I hope

35
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,658
you cry just a little,

36
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:22,703
smile a lot,

37
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,664
and forget me soon.

38
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:45,059
EPISODE 11

39
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:57,863
Grandpa.

40
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,823
You idiot.

41
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,660
I gave you so many chances

42
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,829
to cover it up quietly.

43
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,957
But do you

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,669
have to tell the world
what kind of person you really are

45
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,295
after all this time?

46
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,424
You knew all along?

47
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,053
Did you really think
I didn't know anything?

48
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,806
What are you...

49
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,726
When did you...

50
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,648
It was sent anonymously

51
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,400
to Grandpa.

52
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:38,696
And why can't you be honest
with everyone except her?

53
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,448
What are you hiding from me?

54
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,327
If you're scared, don't run away.
Sit in that seat and gain power.

55
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,622
That's how you protect
yourself and your people.

56
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,709
Then it was all you?

57
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,044
Putting a tail on me in the US

58
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,089
and revealing those photos,
was it all you?

59
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,885
It wasn't, right? That can't be true.

60
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,268
How could you do that?

61
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,854
Why would you?

62
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:14,773
"Why"?

63
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,235
Because I'm your grandpa.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,281
I'm doing this all for you.
My grandchildren.

65
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,868
You know what happened
when your mom didn't listen to me.

66
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,329
Fine, let's say
you really did all that for us.

67
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,625
But then you shouldn't have stopped this.

68
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,629
You saw what happened to Ji-han and A-jung
because of me.

69
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,840
I mustered up my courage to do this.

70
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,093
Don't be mistaken.

71
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,347
Do you really think your decision
will help them?

72
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,768
Have you even thought it over?

73
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,855
If you tell the world who you really are,

74
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,193
do you really think they'd feel at ease?

75
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,862
Isn't that for yourself?

76
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,866
-I--
-Yes,

77
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,495
you're being selfish again,
using them as an excuse.

78
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,748
Running away again.

79
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,670
Sir,

80
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,131
it's Ji-han.

81
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,355
Ji-han! Lee Ji-han!

82
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,528
A-jung.

83
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,956
I feel angry now.

84
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,708
I can't even cry.

85
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,213
This is how he's making me stop crying.

86
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,342
And this is his way of making me smile.

87
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,559
Your brother really thinks
outside the box, doesn't he?

88
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,104
Where do I vent all this anger?

89
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,649
On me, who started
this absurd fake marriage?

90
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,987
Or him,

91
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,115
who left after doing something so crazy?

92
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,245
I guess I should blame the one
who's not here.

93
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,664
Where did Ji-han go?

94
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,793
You should blame me.

95
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,004
You know it.

96
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,590
Like you said before,

97
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,801
I started this act that should've

98
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,012
ended in high school,

99
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,599
and I didn't end it properly.

100
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,816
I tried to end it,

101
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,155
and I wanted to end it well,

102
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,617
but I failed.

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,495
I don't even know how to end it now.

104
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,124
I'm back at square one.

105
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,634
Go and get some rest.

106
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,719
I'll keep looking for Ji-han.

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,514
A-jung.

108
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,394
Sorry.

109
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,109
Call me if you get in touch with Ji-han.

110
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,486
Okay.

111
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,131
What on earth is going on?

112
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,473
Su-jung.

113
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,393
I feel like I've gone back

114
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,312
to when we first told them
you were pregnant.

115
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,899
Oh, my. See? My body's reacting too.

116
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,402
My entire body's aching.

117
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,907
Why don't we just tell them

118
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,409
it's a fake marriage?

119
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,287
-If we do?
-They'd at least

120
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,957
know that she wasn't cheating on him.

121
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,461
Just keep quiet.
It'll just make things worse.

122
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,547
A-jung will take care...

123
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,592
I'm not sure she'll take care of it.

124
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,677
That's what I mean.

125
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,139
She didn't seem to know
about the press conference.

126
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,891
Jeez, A-jung. Seriously...

127
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,227
What?

128
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,646
-A-jung's back.
-Right.

129
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,152
What happened?
What was that press conference?

130
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,695
-A-jung!
-A-jung.

131
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,654
A-jung.

132
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,781
That's enough.

133
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,950
That's the kind of guy he is.

134
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:22,706
He's at fault alone,
so he should pay for it alone.

135
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,624
He shouldn't drag you into it.

136
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,917
Mom.

137
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,128
I told you, he's not that kind of guy.

138
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,215
Are you going to keep taking his side?

139
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,009
It was never real anyway.

140
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,218
-What?
-A-jung!

141
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,054
It was all fake.

142
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,764
An act.

143
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,017
I lied to you.

144
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,480
What are you talking about?

145
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,735
Do-han was in a tight situation,
so we agreed to fake a marriage.

146
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,696
He promised to end it in three years

147
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,615
and that he'd pay me.

148
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,824
Stop it.

149
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,243
And it was a role only I could do.

150
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,287
I guess I wanted to try

151
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,540
something like that once.

152
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,169
Not the minor roles or extras I've played

153
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,338
but an important role like this.

154
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,674
That's how it's come to this.

155
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,928
It was all my choice.

156
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,642
But he's trying
to take all the blame right now.

157
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm sorry I lied to you guys, but...

158
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,945
I like him so much.

159
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,281
It just happened.

160
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,660
I don't think I can live without him.

161
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,914
But I don't even know where he is.

162
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,253
What am I supposed to do?

163
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,635
What do I do now?

164
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:05,892
How could...

165
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,239
What took you so long?

166
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,119
Why did you do it?

167
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,082
It was only right.

168
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,338
What a simple answer.

169
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,257
I know it was a difficult decision.

170
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,675
Do-han.

171
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,012
I'm really okay.

172
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,264
How can you be okay?

173
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,433
Because of me, you--

174
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,476
I came in case...

175
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,230
you'd think that.

176
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,483
I'm sorry I was always burdening you,

177
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,110
saying that it was

178
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,530
for your sake.

179
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,660
But I've really quit doing things...

180
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,830
just because of you.

181
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,125
I told you last time.

182
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,964
Let's live our separate lives now.

183
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,883
I just made my choice.

184
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,601
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,188
I'm really sorry.

186
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,857
Do I have to repeat myself?

187
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,985
I don't have time for that.

188
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,029
And do you think I came
just because of you?

189
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,491
How is A-jung?

190
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,951
See for yourself.

191
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,412
She'll kill me.

192
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,834
She's in a lot of pain.

193
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,254
I thought so.

194
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,550
I can't face her now.

195
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,972
So stay by her side instead of me.

196
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,517
-And you?
-Don't tell her we met.

197
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,645
I want to be

198
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,440
forgotten quickly

199
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,817
by her.

200
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,655
Bye, then.

201
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,639
Yes, Father.

202
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,602
Of course. I've been meeting
with the directors.

203
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,272
They seem to be quite upset.

204
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,233
I think they were grateful
we reached out first.

205
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,778
We can't be sure until the board meeting.

206
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,407
It seems they're worried about business

207
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,368
related to Taeyang Group.

208
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,994
Of course.

209
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,497
I told you, didn't I?

210
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,208
Taeyang will put up a fight.

211
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,630
But we expected it.
We can take our time making preparations.

212
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,758
All right. You seem to be
doing a good job,

213
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,093
so I won't worry.

214
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,846
And Father, even if anything goes wrong,

215
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,684
we still have one card left to play.

216
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,603
All right.

217
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,254
I can't believe he still had this
from that day.

218
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:50,093
What are you hiding, Grandpa?

219
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,488
You really don't know where Lee Ji-han is?

220
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,950
I'm not hiding anything.
I couldn't find him anywhere.

221
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,661
I told you when A-jung was here.

222
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,207
Jong-hee, are you done yet?

223
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,877
Just the fruits left.

224
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,715
This feels pretty threatening, Ji-ae,

225
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,467
but I'm your boyfriend.

226
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,302
And A-jung's my friend.

227
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,554
I really don't know.

228
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,222
You can't even guess?

229
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,349
A-jung's in a total mess

230
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,143
trying to find him!

231
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,854
I... Well...

232
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,608
It seems he won't tell us.

233
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,067
-Let's go see A-jung.
-Okay.

234
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,069
-You got everything, right?
-Yes.

235
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,448
Porridge and soup for her digestion,
and some fruit,

236
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,784
grilled intestines, and chicken feet.

237
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,123
I'll let you off the hook today, Taek.

238
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,210
But there won't be a next time.

239
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,963
You'd better find out where Lee Ji-han is
as soon as possible.

240
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,090
And watch the cafe.

241
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,682
Darn it. Where is he,
and what the hell is he doing?

242
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,142
I'm so worried!

243
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,989
It's still daytime?

244
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,284
Time's passing so slowly.

245
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:50,023
Come back while I'm asking nicely.
Or I'll never forgive you.

246
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,361
You're not just leaving like this, right?

247
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,407
You're going to come back soon, right?

248
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,973
Sir, wait!

249
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,090
I went to your house again today.

250
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,219
When are you coming back?

251
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,099
If you won't come, I'll go to you.

252
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,185
I take back what I said. I'll forgive you.

253
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,104
So please just...

254
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,355
I'm going crazy.

255
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,191
I can't even see you in my dreams.
I'm waiting.

256
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,403
I think about you every day, but why...

257
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,947
I miss you, Ji-han.

258
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,201
You think he read my texts?

259
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,081
-No?
-Even if he did, he's ignoring them.

260
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,208
Just stop sending them.

261
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,085
How do I get him to reply, then?

262
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,130
Eat something first.
You'll collapse at this rate.

263
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,382
Will he reply if he hears I collapsed?

264
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,635
Hey, stop it, or I'll get angry.

265
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,641
Time's passing so slowly.

266
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,899
I'm exhausted. I feel so sleepy.

267
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,283
I hope he'll be here
when I close my eyes and open them again.

268
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,870
It might take a long time, so I should

269
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,788
sleep for a long time.

270
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,876
Maybe I should just

271
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,879
hibernate for a while.

272
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,053
What?

273
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,014
You're getting a call from Mr. Kim.

274
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,809
Oh, right.

275
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,022
Hello?

276
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,463
What are you talking about?

277
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,715
Just marry him.

278
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,551
It's what you wanted.

279
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,261
If you do,

280
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,223
you can keep Do-han's secret,

281
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,518
and he'll get the company.

282
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,523
I don't understand what you mean.

283
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,277
I guess he didn't tell you
I knew all along.

284
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,739
My gosh.

285
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,576
That weak little boy.

286
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,869
He's so soft.

287
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,581
He's not changed at all,
even after all I told him.

288
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,752
Ms. Na, I'm now asking you

289
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,879
to convince Do-han for me.

290
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:44,507
I...

291
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,052
I can't do that.

292
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,137
What do you mean?

293
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,806
You can't marry him?

294
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,559
I mean I won't.

295
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,524
How could you do this?

296
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,442
I told you everything.

297
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,613
What Ji-han said
at the press conference was a lie,

298
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,283
and I have feelings for him too.

299
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,286
If I just marry Do-han,

300
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,787
what about Ji-han?

301
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,750
He'll just be a jerk
who loved his sister-in-law.

302
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,253
Didn't Ji-han decide to do that

303
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,088
for you?

304
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,424
Well,

305
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,176
we couldn't stop Ji-han,

306
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,386
but we have to stop Do-han.

307
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,556
We can't let Do-han
make a bad choice because of you!

308
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,934
What... What do you mean?

309
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,026
Do-han prepared a press conference as well

310
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,238
to reveal the secret
he wanted to hide so badly.

311
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,950
Ji-han and Do-han are doing this

312
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,744
because of you.

313
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,248
Will you be okay
watching them give up everything?

314
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,502
If that's not the case,

315
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,175
then just do
what you planned in the first place.

316
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,438
I'm really sorry,

317
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,524
but there's nothing else to hear from you.

318
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,051
Mr. Hyun.

319
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,179
I'm curious about one thing.

320
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,266
How is that for their sakes?

321
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,687
What's wrong with everyone?

322
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,857
All this nonsense,
thinking it's for someone else's sake.

323
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,193
-What?
-Mr. Hyun.

324
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:13,739
I guess your grandsons were
too kind-hearted and soft

325
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,491
to say anything to you,

326
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,702
so I'll say this for them.

327
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,371
A real grandpa

328
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,958
should not be calling their sons

329
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,127
idiots or weak fools.

330
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,298
He should dote on them, taking their side.

331
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,757
And nagging

332
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,884
should be telling them

333
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,553
to cross the road safely,

334
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,097
wear bright clothes at night,

335
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,726
or bring an umbrella all the time,

336
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,769
treating them like kids

337
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,813
even if they're over 30.

338
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,191
That's what you do for their sakes.

339
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,572
So be kinder to them. Please.

340
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,609
I tried to end it,

341
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,780
and I wanted to end it well,

342
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,658
but I failed.

343
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,244
Then that's when...

344
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,709
-What is that?
-That's crazy.

345
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,379
-The LJ chairman's grandson?
-No way!

346
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,465
-I don't understand, though.
-Me either. It's crazy.

347
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,677
What my brother Lee Ji-han said
at the press conference

348
00:27:58,761 --> 00:27:59,929
was a lie.

349
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,143
My marriage was fake, and it was
planned to hide my sexual orientation.

350
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:11,399
My brother held a press conference
to hide it from the public.

351
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,783
A-jung, what's he saying?

352
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,827
-A fake marriage?
-Are you okay?

353
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,620
-Is this true?
-What is this?

354
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,041
Let me repeat.

355
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,379
It was a false statement
to hide my secret...

356
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,843
Have you lost your mind?

357
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,721
A-jung, just listen to me first.
I want to say something.

358
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,976
You must've been shocked.

359
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,310
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,813
But even if I told you

361
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,398
and you tried to stop me,

362
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,650
nothing would've changed.

363
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,528
You told me before

364
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:02,658
that a good friend should encourage you
and stay by your side,

365
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,369
not run away from a problem with you.

366
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,664
I want you to do that for me.

367
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,792
And I thought about it

368
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,836
and realized

369
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,423
it was a choice
for me to fully live as myself.

370
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,677
So I don't want you to feel guilty.

371
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,890
Still, how could you do this?

372
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:27,558
Right.

373
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,061
I revealed the truth and broke the clause

374
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,064
on confidentiality.

375
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,443
We have no choice

376
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,279
but to break the contract now.

377
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,157
But don't forget

378
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,702
the Friendship Preservation clause.

379
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,499
"Whatever happens, the priority
is the client and actress' friendship."

380
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:55,252
"This clause is valid
even if the contract ends."

381
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,590
So even if our contract's over,

382
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,051
you'll still be my friend.

383
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,970
Yes, this is right.

384
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,015
Pretending to be dating you is really...

385
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,102
You little...

386
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,355
I'll call you again soon. Take care.

387
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,525
I'm really sorry,

388
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,236
and thank you, A-jung.

389
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,020
I never expected Do-han's secret.

390
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,065
Then Jung Dae-hyeon...

391
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,696
Anyway, this is good for you.

392
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,197
I hear

393
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,658
you're about to take over LJ.

394
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,118
Thanks.

395
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,746
But I didn't ask to meet because of that.

396
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,083
Did you find the footage, then?

397
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,543
No, it's not that.

398
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,799
I was just curious about something.

399
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,640
Why are you so desperate
to find the security camera footage?

400
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,809
What are you so upset about?

401
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,561
You won't believe me anyway.

402
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,354
I'll be the judge of that.

403
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,696
Fine, then.

404
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,245
I'll tell you.

405
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,500
The day I found out
where your mother was staying

406
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,710
and chased her,

407
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,254
I was with someone.

408
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,466
Your father,

409
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,428
Choi Jung-chan.

410
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,812
Following your mother was his idea...

411
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,523
Be careful.

412
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,941
...in the first place.

413
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,902
He was more obsessed

414
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,863
with finding her than the chairman.

415
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,284
Yes, I'm following her with Mr. Kang.

416
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,870
-She won't get away this time.
-That's enough.

417
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,246
What?

418
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,916
Just stop this! Come back home right now.

419
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,921
But Father, we'll lose Su-hyeon again!

420
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,174
I'll take care of it myself.
So you stay out of it.

421
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,426
I'm warning you.

422
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,844
Father!

423
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,805
Damn it!

424
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,183
What do we do?

425
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,269
Don't be stupid, keep chasing her!

426
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,397
We're ending this today.

427
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,446
Go faster!

428
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,241
It'll be dangerous.
There's a kid in there.

429
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,160
I don't care about that!
Just go faster! Faster!

430
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,829
I tried to stop him,

431
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,915
but he was out of his mind.

432
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,220
This way!

433
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,683
What are you doing? Stop!

434
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:43,439
And in the end...

435
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,871
That's it?

436
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,707
And you felt wronged by that?

437
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,588
No, it's what happened after.

438
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,382
Only my car was caught
by the traffic camera.

439
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,884
Without any other proof,

440
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,344
I took all the blame

441
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,473
while Mr. Choi's presence was erased.

442
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,058
I looked for other footage.

443
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,313
There was a security cam near the scene.

444
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,066
Even if Mr. Choi didn't know about it,

445
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:34,156
I'm sure the chairman would've found it.

446
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:42,539
Sir, our detective found
a private security cam nearby.

447
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,417
You should take a look.

448
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,311
His son-in-law had killed his daughter.

449
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:49,064
So I don't understand

450
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,234
why he covered it up.

451
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:16,300
Whatever the case, Mr. Hyun knows
the truth about the accident.

452
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,220
He wouldn't tell me to keep quiet about it

453
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,514
and bribe me otherwise.

454
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,809
He could just say I was lying.

455
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,320
So Father killed her?

456
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,927
FATHER

457
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,283
You knew how I felt

458
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,120
and what I gave up to be with you.

459
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,124
I gave up Do-han,
who was everything to me.

460
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,251
I won't run away this time.

461
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:38,006
I'm going to protect you and Ji-han...

462
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,884
The scandal about my brother,

463
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,638
his fiancée, and me

464
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,391
is not true.

465
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,102
I was the one chasing after her.

466
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,649
Will you be okay
watching them give up everything?

467
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,819
It really is all my fault.

468
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,796
Could I see you for a moment?

469
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,299
It's been a while.

470
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,302
Well, I've seen you recently.

471
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,016
Every day, I see dozens of new articles

472
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,893
about you three,
all with different contents.

473
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,896
Why did you do such a thing?

474
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,900
I did think it was weird,
but a fake marriage?

475
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,695
It was beyond anything I imagined.

476
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,741
It was beyond what I could handle too.

477
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,620
I'm regretting it right now.

478
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,291
I'm sorry.

479
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,796
-I was harsh to you.
-Oh.

480
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,592
It's fine, you didn't know.

481
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,139
So what will you do now?

482
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,145
That's actually why I wanted to see you.

483
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,275
I have to at least meet Ji-han
to talk about this,

484
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,361
but I don't know where he is.

485
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,865
If you meet him, will you hold onto him?

486
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,412
I'm going to let him go.

487
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,040
I'm going to end it.

488
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,001
When I started it with Ji-han,

489
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,879
I told myself

490
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:45,133
that we'd fight together until the end,

491
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,094
whatever it would be.

492
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,347
And I guess we've reached it.

493
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,433
So you saw something?

494
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,811
No, I didn't see anything.

495
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,982
It was just dark.

496
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,404
That was our end.

497
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,616
We were already at the edge,

498
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,913
but I couldn't accept it

499
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,500
and kept walking in place,

500
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,210
thinking I'd see something

501
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,213
if we continued.

502
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,175
Hurting people I care about.

503
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,178
That's a pity.

504
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,723
I thought you'd make a different decision,

505
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,684
not such a predictable one.

506
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,856
Somewhere Ji-han could be...

507
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,108
I'm not sure.

508
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,735
Since we were little,

509
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,321
he'd take me to arcades when I was sad,

510
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,449
but when he was sad,
he held everything in alone.

511
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,034
So I don't know.

512
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,288
Is there anyone else who might know?

513
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:57,873
You, A-jung.

514
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,585
You became someone

515
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,421
he found comfort in.

516
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,466
I think you'd know where he'd be.

517
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,644
My dopamine levels
are increasing every day.

518
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,272
I really enjoy watching the news.

519
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,233
It's dopamine for you,

520
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,776
but it's stress for me.

521
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,279
Honey, just give up.

522
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,197
What?

523
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,742
I did some thinking,
and even if we plan a step ahead,

524
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,244
they're planning two, three steps ahead.

525
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,830
We'll feel better just giving up.

526
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,168
Wow, what an amazing realization.

527
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,213
Come on.

528
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,340
The board meeting's soon.

529
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:52,385
At this rate, Seung-a and your father
will take over the company.

530
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,555
Shouldn't we support them now?

531
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,057
No.

532
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,059
Who knows? They might break up.

533
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,311
Jeez.

534
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,313
You idiot!

535
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,358
Why do you even need skincare?

536
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,904
You have no stress at all,
and your face is dripping with oil.

537
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,864
Look at that oil. Gross.

538
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,115
Darn it.

539
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,700
No, that won't do.

540
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,925
It'd be so nice to live here.

541
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,595
There are mountains and the ocean.

542
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,142
We can go see flowers in spring,
fireworks in summer,

543
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,354
then autumn leaves in fall,

544
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,940
and snow in winter.

545
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,193
You want to see things all year?

546
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,195
You just need to see me.

547
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,199
Hey, do you want me to leave you here?

548
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,326
All right.

549
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,187
Hold my hand.

550
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,481
My imagination has voice support now.

551
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,775
Why is it so vivid?

552
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,111
Why is it communicating with me?

553
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,739
-Come on, hold it.
-You can't fool me.

554
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,115
You'll disappear.

555
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,910
Just give it a try.

556
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,704
You haven't been updated.

557
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,333
The current A-jung
would be much more violent

558
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,168
and aggressive

559
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,086
and would

560
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:52,672
hate me much more.

561
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,470
She'd call me like this.

562
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,637
Hey, Lee Ji-han!

563
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,265
You have a death wish?

564
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:05,018
Yes, that's more like it.

565
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:14,444
You're...

566
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,406
actually here?

567
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,339
Have you not been well?

568
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,469
Shouldn't you ask if I've been well?

569
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,973
It's obvious you haven't.

570
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,394
How badly were you doing?

571
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:50,897
I just

572
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,608
walked and slept,

573
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,445
walked and slept.

574
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,784
You did well at not doing well.

575
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,622
What about you?

576
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,628
I was busy not doing well too.

577
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,179
Darn it, I came to end this.

578
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,393
The reason why I came here is...

579
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,815
I came here because...

580
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,112
-I...
-Have you

581
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:41,781
eaten yet?

582
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,741
I'm so hungry.

583
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,327
Let's talk after we eat.

584
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:52,333
Hang on.

585
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,675
ROOM AVAILABLE

586
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:36,794
That was good.

587
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,589
Should we go for a walk?

588
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,369
Want to play with fireworks?

589
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,913
We couldn't do it last time.

590
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,291
Wait here.

591
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,145
SUPERMARKET

592
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:37,981
Shall we go?

593
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,164
It's over.

594
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,084
That was the last one.

595
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:47,550
Right.

596
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,597
There's nothing more to do now.

597
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,185
We should do what we need to do.

598
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:26,381
I really hated you for leaving like that.

599
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,468
I thought, "What do I do about him?"

600
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,471
You know what they say,

601
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,475
"The best revenge after a breakup
is living well."

602
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:42,271
But I wanted to live as badly as I could

603
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,694
because you wanted me to smile
when you left.

604
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,904
So I thought, "I'll cry."

605
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,741
"I'll cry every day, all the time."

606
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,997
"I'll get my eyes puffy
and my voice hoarse."

607
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,669
"Then we'll both

608
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,797
live miserably for a long time."

609
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,008
But...

610
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,848
I'm going to stop that now.

611
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,940
I realized it was all meaningless.

612
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,777
We'll be miserable if we start

613
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,573
seeing each other again.

614
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,169
You heard about Do-han, right?

615
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:50,423
It's all over the news and the internet.

616
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,010
Yes.

617
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,890
Do-han says it's not,
but it's because of us.

618
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,145
So we can't be in a relationship.

619
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,027
I don't want any more pain.

620
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,420
We went

621
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:33,716
through a lot

622
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:36,093
until now.

623
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,183
I hope you do well now.

624
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,062
You too.

625
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,123
I really liked you a lot.

626
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,089
Bye, Ji-han.

627
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,601
Bye, A-jung.

628
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,817
1 YEAR LATER

629
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:05,743
Hey.

630
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,455
Su-hyeon, Ji-han's here.

631
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,165
THE LATE HYUN SU-HYEON

632
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,422
Time goes by so fast.

633
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:22,218
Have you been well?

634
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:24,720
Yes.

635
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,806
Good.

636
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,353
It poured like this last year too.

637
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,524
But except for that,

638
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,111
everything's different.

639
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,325
What about Do-han?

640
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,413
Are you in touch with him?

641
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,249
Why is he not here to see his mother?

642
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,961
It'll be hard for him to face you.

643
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,133
I heard

644
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,678
that you knew all along

645
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:09,390
about Do-han and A-jung.

646
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,060
So?

647
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,063
You're not going to see me too?

648
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:19,608
You were too harsh.

649
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,029
Do-han didn't deserve it,

650
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,531
even if I did.

651
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,533
"Even if I did"?

652
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,369
What do you mean?

653
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,458
I sometimes think,

654
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,713
"When did it start to go wrong?"

655
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,591
And when I think back,

656
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:47,803
it's always that day...

657
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,057
The day of the accident.

658
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,602
If Mom hadn't died because of me,

659
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,270
things would be different.

660
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,775
Do-han and I would be

661
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,944
living normal lives.

662
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,573
How many times do I have to tell you
it's not your fault?

663
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,450
You're mistaken.

664
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:11,577
You're just...

665
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,998
saying that

666
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,667
because you don't want

667
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,420
to talk about that day.

668
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,464
I know you resent me for it.

669
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,051
Everyone knows that.

670
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33,307
It's not because I hate you
or blame you...

671
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,228
that I don't talk about it.

672
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,563
All right?

673
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,860
It's because...

674
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:50,366
It's just

675
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,745
that I can't forgive myself for it.

676
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,919
It was all my fault.

677
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,714
I can't forgive myself.

678
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,136
When I realized that something was wrong,

679
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:14,056
it was already too late.

680
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,411
Mom.

681
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,415
Mom.

682
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,169
Ji-han.

683
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:44,628
Ji-han!

684
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,464
Mom.

685
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,342
Ji-han, don't worry.

686
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,012
Don't worry. It's okay.

687
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,437
JUNG-CHAN

688
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,402
Why aren't you picking up?

689
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,000
I think that too every day.

690
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:28,047
"When did it start to go wrong?"

691
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:37,556
Su-hyeon!

692
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:41,143
Su-hyeon!

693
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:42,061
Su-hyeon.

694
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,646
Su-hyeon!

695
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:46,607
Su-hyeon, wake up.

696
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,330
Su-hyeon...

697
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:03,916
Su-hyeon!

698
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,961
It's me, your dad!

699
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,630
What? What is it?

700
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,674
-Dad.
-Su-hyeon, I'll get you out.

701
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:13,884
-Dad.
-What?

702
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,137
Ji-han.

703
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:18,889
Ji-han...

704
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:20,724
Ji-han...

705
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,437
Ji-han...

706
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:33,904
Ji-han...

707
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,328
Ji-han...

708
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:42,913
Ji-han...

709
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:11,275
If I had gotten there
a little sooner that day,

710
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,863
if I hadn't hesitated,

711
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,159
then I...

712
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,913
I might not have lost her like that.

713
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:31,962
I regret it every day.

714
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:36,925
I'm sorry.

715
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,846
I know there's no point saying it now.

716
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:48,562
But there's one thing I don't regret.

717
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,860
Saving you that day.

718
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:59,990
I know it's strange for me to say that

719
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:04,244
when I ignored you your whole life
and made you feel lonely.

720
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,793
Yes, whenever I saw your face,

721
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,004
I was reminded of your mom
and what I did to her.

722
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:19,009
So I wanted to bury it all. That's why.

723
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:21,804
But

724
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,432
even if I went back, I would save you.

725
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:31,480
That's what your mother wanted.

726
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,276
So what happened that day

727
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,905
is never your fault.

728
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:44,743
It's okay if you won't see me ever again,

729
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,039
but you should forget that day.

730
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,043
I'll hold all the regrets and pain.

731
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:05,514
I'll leave now.

732
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,604
Take your time talking with her.

733
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,066
Mom was...

734
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:23,949
She was happy.

735
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:27,369
It may have been a short time,

736
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:30,122
but when I think back on it,

737
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,086
she was always smiling.

738
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,012
Is that so?

739
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,600
That's a relief.

740
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,813
Don't get rained on.

741
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:11,491
How have you been, A-jung?
Did you do well without me?

742
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:12,951
I've...

743
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:14,244
been great.

744
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:17,539
I'm glad he's doing well, though.

745
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:18,665
A-jung!

746
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,460
Will you really not date Ji-han?

747
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,297
Work is an excuse.
Is it because of A-jung?

748
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,342
A-jung suffered so much because of you.

749
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,344
He's A-jung's boyfriend.

750
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,138
I don't want to lose you again.

751
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:37,893
I can't live without you, A-jung.
