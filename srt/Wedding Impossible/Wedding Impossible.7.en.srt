1
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,857
Since it's over, just be honest.

2
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,943
You came to ruin it, didn't you?

3
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,363
I think I can see

4
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,826
the right path for me now.

5
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,540
Attending the meeting

6
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,461
meant I'd accept it.

7
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,307
Accept what?

8
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,559
You and Do-han.

9
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,655
I hope you live happily

10
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,199
with my brother.

11
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,172
You know, they say

12
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:56,844
that wishing someone happiness
comes from the heart.

13
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:03,517
And I couldn't feel his sincerity at all,
so it bothered me so much.

14
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,521
It felt like he actually

15
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,524
wanted to say something else.

16
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,011
Why do I feel like
I can get the answer from you?

17
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,766
You're torn.

18
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,687
Then I'll think about

19
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,732
whether I should tell Ji-ae

20
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,901
that you approached her

21
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,028
just to get info about me.

22
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,992
So how's Ji-han doing?

23
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,206
Something bothering you again?

24
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,667
Want to go to the temple? Or the church?

25
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,087
I'm worried about our sales.
It's a mess right now.

26
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,256
By the way,
I don't have any religions now.

27
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,133
Are you serious?

28
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,887
No more confusion.
I only believe in myself now.

29
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,098
Isn't it great?

30
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,810
A life without any concern
about Satan or karma.

31
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,690
2023 LJ GROUP
MODEL EMPLOYEE LEE JI-HAN

32
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,816
Okay, Do-han.

33
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,653
Don't worry. Enjoy your time with A-jung.

34
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,532
You're serious?

35
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,200
No more stress.

36
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
I'm going to focus on recovering.

37
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,329
Isn't it great?

38
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,999
A simple life where I no longer

39
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,669
have to be curious about
what she and Do-han are doing.

40
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,421
How do I put it?

41
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,840
He seems like he's finally

42
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,634
at peace after experiencing a huge storm.

43
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,095
No hidden schemes,

44
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,055
and doing well?

45
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,266
What could it be?

46
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,185
Maybe he's finally realized

47
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,188
that he no longer needs
to worry about you.

48
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,610
The chairman accepted you, and
the family meeting's over. It's game over.

49
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,822
He probably wants to stop

50
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,284
wasting his time opposing
and focus on work again.

51
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,172
What?

52
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,673
Oh, wow.

53
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,384
Did you change your car?

54
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,094
Yes, I did.

55
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,179
But why?

56
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,805
You said you had no plans

57
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,640
to change your car yet.

58
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,853
I wanted to start afresh
with a new car and a new heart.

59
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,937
Bye, then.

60
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,537
What kind of new life could it be?

61
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,332
How is he so cool?

62
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,542
A life with debts, for sure.

63
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,171
He's obviously car poor.
That's too expensive for his salary.

64
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,716
Is he going on a date? With that girl?

65
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,010
You're right. It must be her.

66
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,267
You reached your answer

67
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,186
sooner than I thought.

68
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,188
No, it took longer than I thought.

69
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:41,401
I should've answered right away,
but I had too many thoughts on my mind.

70
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,737
So? What's your answer?

71
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,116
I will

72
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,534
put in my effort.

73
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,035
Effort?

74
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,622
To get everything to find its place.
Including my feelings.

75
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,500
That's vague.

76
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,461
You're keeping me on the hook?

77
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,427
Fine, I'll stay on that hook, then.

78
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,140
A vague reply is
better than a firm rejection.

79
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,019
Just like business.
It's easier to dig in if there's a crack.

80
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,355
Keep making an effort.

81
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,108
I'll do the same.

82
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,541
I hope you live happily

83
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,668
with my brother.

84
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,004
Right.

85
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,464
Let's be happy.

86
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,216
It's nothing special.

87
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,385
He told me to.

88
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,889
He's finally accepting us.

89
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,703
His happiness is my happiness.

90
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,249
So I always want the best for him.

91
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,294
That's normal to me.

92
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,004
Is that so wrong?

93
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,801
Congratulations, A-jung.

94
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,141
You finally stole Do-han from Ji-han.

95
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,734
EPISODE 7

96
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,528
I want to go home.

97
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,833
The family meeting's over,
so you've cleared a big hurdle.

98
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,629
The chairman's helping, so don't worry.

99
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,049
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

100
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,842
I've been wondering,

101
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,429
why does Grandpa care so much
about my marriage?

102
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,517
Honestly, I thought he'd oppose A-jung.

103
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,271
But he accepted her,
and he's even helping us now.

104
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,523
I don't understand.

105
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,150
I believe

106
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,736
he wants to atone for what he did.

107
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,365
Opposing the late Ms. Hyun
and your father.

108
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,951
He may look fine,

109
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,955
but his scars haven't healed yet.

110
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,792
I'm not my mom's replacement,
and I can't ever be.

111
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,294
Of course not.

112
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,588
Still, you can give him a chance.

113
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,924
And maybe

114
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,261
to everyone who was hurt by that incident.

115
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,602
What is it?

116
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,146
Gosh, you startled me.

117
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,023
-What?
-Jeez.

118
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,691
Come here.

119
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,193
-Why?
-Come on.

120
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,825
You wanted to have dinner with Grandpa.
Why are we going home?

121
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
We supported Na A-jung

122
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,123
so she'd stop Do-han
from getting the company,

123
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,459
but she's helping him.

124
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,504
Do-han and Grandfather
are just getting closer now.

125
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,841
Honey, let's set off a bomb.

126
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,509
A bomb?

127
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,012
We'll reveal a huge scandal.

128
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,513
Boom!

129
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,686
Aren't your teeth cold?

130
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,271
-They are.
-They are?

131
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,900
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

132
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,151
Oh, sure.

133
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:55,072
I'm looking for this house.
Do you know where it is?

134
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,033
Who are you?

135
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,284
Oh, I'm...

136
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,080
-I'm a reporter for Jekook Daily.
-I see.

137
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:07,834
I was told the future wife of LJ Group's
third grandson lives nearby.

138
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,878
Have you seen...

139
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,338
That's our house.

140
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,422
-Your house?
-Hey.

141
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,634
The houses all look similar around here.

142
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,469
He was mistaken.

143
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,679
She doesn't live there.

144
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,015
I mean, it's not our house.

145
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,434
Let's go. Come on.

146
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,519
Let's go.

147
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,314
-Hello?
-Yes?

148
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,942
-Can I ask you something?
-What is it?

149
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,735
Hello, I'm a reporter for...

150
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,657
Are you the one marrying
the grandson of LJ Group?

151
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,119
I wanted a comment about your marriage.

152
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,286
Can you open this?

153
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,372
No, we can't.

154
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,874
I don't know what you're talking about.

155
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,877
-We...
-LJ? Don't be ridiculous.

156
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,546
She doesn't live here.

157
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,630
She's right.

158
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,134
-She's mine.
-Yes.

159
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,553
She's not marrying someone from LJ.

160
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,721
She's the mother

161
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,306
of my child.

162
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,685
Anyways, it's not our house.
Check somewhere else.

163
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,104
-Right. I'm sorry.
-Bye.

164
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,523
Honey, he left.

165
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,233
He's looking for A-jung!

166
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,069
-What's going on?
-Hurry.

167
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:19,364
There are reporters
looking for A-jung around here...

168
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,782
-Be quiet.
-What?

169
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,908
-Go inside.
-What?

170
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,161
Is someone looking for me?

171
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,205
-Hey! Go back inside!
-No!

172
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,082
-Go inside!
-Get inside!

173
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,751
-What's going on?
-Hurry!

174
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,630
My foot!

175
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,968
I heard from secretary team that the
chairman's grandson is getting married.

176
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,595
They're trying to stop the press.

177
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,932
I'm sure they made
preparations for that beforehand.

178
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,976
The woman's an ordinary person,

179
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,061
so they prepared fake info on her,

180
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,646
but real info got leaked.

181
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,399
It must be tiring
marrying into that family.

182
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,110
She'll get harassed by reporters.

183
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,987
We're the victims here.

184
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,617
Stock prices fluctuated because of
that grandson, and there was chaos.

185
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,328
This might cause more trouble at work.

186
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,079
Don't you agree?

187
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,624
You're right.

188
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,094
You're not married yet.
Is it okay to live there?

189
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,056
There are more reporters outside now.

190
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,518
I can't stay cooped up in here forever.

191
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,229
If I stay here, you'll keep suffering.

192
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,064
Can you trust that family?

193
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,485
He said, "We want to protect her."
But look at what's happening.

194
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,112
-Take this too.
-What?

195
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,490
I didn't get to make a lot, though.

196
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,493
-Eat it with Do-han.
-What is this?

197
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,788
Come back anytime
if it's uncomfortable there.

198
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,374
Don't make such a fuss, Mom.

199
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,585
The secretary says
he'll make sure things get quiet.

200
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,837
I'll only stay there until then.

201
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,091
-I can't believe this.
-My goodness.

202
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,970
Hey. Get there safely, okay?

203
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,846
-Text me if you're bored.
-Okay.

204
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,932
Mom.

205
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,935
-I'll drive you.
-It's fine.

206
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,645
-It's okay.
-Stop it.

207
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,523
-Be safe.
-Bye.

208
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,108
Bye, Ji-oh.

209
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,156
Hey.

210
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,034
-Do you like me?
-What?

211
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,787
I mean, I want to make things clear.

212
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,747
If you like me,

213
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,666
then say it now.

214
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,710
Well, I...

215
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,840
I didn't prepare anything to say yet.

216
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,758
Right.

217
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,721
Ji-ae.

218
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,810
Ever since this cafe opened
in front of our company,

219
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,480
I've always

220
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,027
-liked...
-I have to hear it

221
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,446
to decide whether to turn you down.

222
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,574
What? Whether or not to turn me down?

223
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,950
So, you do like me?

224
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,369
I can answer you now, right?

225
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,664
I'm not interested in you at all--

226
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,669
There was something in my ear.

227
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,382
If I don't tell you that I like you,

228
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,718
then I won't get turned down, right?

229
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,221
You just started to say you liked me.

230
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,142
No, I was going to say

231
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,102
that I like your coffee.

232
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,064
Your coffee is the best around here.

233
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,940
I like this coffee.

234
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,910
What did he say? Did he say it?

235
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:52,994
Yes.

236
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,164
-He said he liked...
-Wow.

237
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,041
my coffee.

238
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,753
-What?
-I can't believe it.

239
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,714
I'm not interested in him at all,

240
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,841
but if he asked me out sincerely,

241
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,468
I might've said yes...

242
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,012
Who is he

243
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,349
to make me feel like I was turned down?

244
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,772
Taek.

245
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,858
The chairman keeps asking
how the info was leaked.

246
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,903
This coffee is my only

247
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,072
method for relaxation.

248
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,658
Really?

249
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,619
This coffee is

250
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,913
my sadness right now.

251
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,048
You're suffering a lot
because of Ji-han too.

252
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,927
You call yourselves family?

253
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,513
How could you

254
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,600
go around spilling family matters
to the reporters?

255
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,936
That wasn't us.

256
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,856
We got that article released, but...

257
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,940
But?

258
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,901
But we didn't call that reporter
at the memorial.

259
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,989
Right. And the public has
the right to know the truth.

260
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,073
The truth?

261
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,827
All right. I may not know about the truth,

262
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,746
but I can tell you how I feel.

263
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,791
I have no intention

264
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,086
of giving the company to you two,

265
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,923
so don't even dream about it.
That's how I feel.

266
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,271
Hey.

267
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,190
Hey!

268
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,194
You... Are you crazy?
You did this, didn't you?

269
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,737
-Do what?
-"Do what?"

270
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,614
Look at her playing dumb.

271
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,783
I saw it, Seung-a.

272
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,701
You were smirking in there.

273
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,078
Are you framing us for what you did?

274
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,372
You bitch, how dare you!

275
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,541
What? Can't I do that?

276
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,211
You framed me for drunk driving.

277
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,212
Choi Seung-a!

278
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,882
So you know my name.
Then stop calling me a bitch.

279
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,175
Seung-a.

280
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,135
You're making a big mistake.

281
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,470
If Father finds out--

282
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:19,265
Yes. If he hears
he fell out of favor with Grandpa,

283
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,519
he'll make a different choice.

284
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,985
I told you, didn't I?

285
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,154
I said there was no need to worry

286
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,740
and that we should
get rid of both of them.

287
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,288
I warned you.
You're the one who didn't get it.

288
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,541
You idiot.

289
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,839
You think it'll be you
who gets the company then?

290
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,757
It will be me. Wait and see.

291
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,801
And keep quiet.

292
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,813
Honey.

293
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,065
What do we do now?

294
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,862
-Are we really done for? Is that it?
-Let go of me!

295
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,738
Say something! Damn it!

296
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,719
I must have underestimated

297
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,845
this marriage.

298
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,055
Marriage is easy.

299
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,308
The fame makes it hard.

300
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,310
Should I just do

301
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,395
-the interview?
-What?

302
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,938
I mean,

303
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,025
I don't get why I have to hide.

304
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,652
People are curious too.

305
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,572
I'll just show them who I am

306
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,574
without being all mysterious.

307
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,410
It's a waste to hide this face.

308
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,917
I keep ending up bothering you with stuff

309
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,503
like this and the family meeting.

310
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
Sorry.

311
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,383
It's fine. Stop apologizing.

312
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:22,096
Besides, your brother helped us out.

313
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,016
It's a relief that Ji-han finally

314
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,142
accepted you.

315
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,645
I'm not sure if he accepted me

316
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,397
or just gave up opposing me.

317
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,861
I'm still not sure
if it's right to stay here.

318
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,696
You're not living here alone.

319
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,741
I can stay at your studio--

320
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,662
No, I can't let you do that.
Just make yourself at home.

321
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,122
What's this, though?

322
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,125
-My mom packed some side dishes.
-Oh, okay.

323
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,296
How are you, Terry?

324
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,131
I'm home.

325
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,345
Is no one here?

326
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,789
NA A-JUNG

327
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,542
NO RESULTS

328
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,295
LJ GRANDSON MARRIAGE

329
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,549
WHO WILL INHERIT LJ?

330
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,925
There's nothing yet.

331
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,055
Lee Ji-han.

332
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,434
After everything you said,
what are you doing?

333
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,352
You accepted her. It's over.

334
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,730
You shouldn't worry about her anymore.

335
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,633
My eyesight is really bad.

336
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,262
And I wasn't wearing my glasses,
so don't worry.

337
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,350
Didn't you get LASEK last year?

338
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,815
So why did you
come into the house so quietly?

339
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,818
Oh, so it's my fault?

340
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,280
I came into my own house too quietly?

341
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,948
I didn't mean that.

342
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,826
I mean, you should've gotten dressed.

343
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,662
Oh, so that's my fault too.

344
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,040
I was naked in my own house.

345
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,500
I mean...

346
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,127
It's my fault. I'm at fault.

347
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,171
I should've told him I was here.

348
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,131
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,469
No, you're my sister-in-law.
It's my fault for not being careful.

350
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,429
Just yell if you're angry.

351
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,475
You being like that makes me feel uneasy.

352
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,352
Angry? I'm not angry at all.

353
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,232
Of course, I should
keep my sister-in-law safe here.

354
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,400
Hang on.

355
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,070
Since when was she your sister-in-law?

356
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,613
Since now.

357
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,533
Anyway, enjoy a comfortable stay here.

358
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,243
Bye, then.

359
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:39,836
Hang on,

360
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,466
you're not sharing a room, are you?

361
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,018
He's ridiculous.

362
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:01,524
Why's he suddenly
calling me his sister-in-law?

363
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,109
Sister-in-law...

364
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,152
Don't you agree?

365
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,239
He's ridiculous.

366
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,918
I can sleep in the living room.

367
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,130
-You're going out?
-I have something to do.

368
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,426
Ji-han.

369
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,763
Thanks for accepting A-jung.

370
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,390
Come on. That's cringey.

371
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,934
Go to bed. See you later.

372
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,145
Don't stay out too late.

373
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,362
You should've gotten dressed.

374
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,573
You should've worked out.

375
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,826
Whether they share a room or not,

376
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,120
you shouldn't have said that!

377
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,080
She might feel uncomfortable

378
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,166
sharing a room with you.

379
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,668
Plus, you're not married yet.

380
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,087
Do you have any sleeping habits?

381
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,548
He has really bad ones. He could hit you.

382
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,925
Darn it.

383
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,261
It's fine.

384
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,514
I can do it.

385
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,184
She is my sister-in-law.

386
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,895
I can live with her

387
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,147
under the same roof!

388
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,631
I'm not opposing you sharing a bed.

389
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,258
It's just strange

390
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,218
to do that in this huge house.

391
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:05,856
It was a good purchase.

392
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,527
All right.

393
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,655
Once she's out, it's final.

394
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,324
This is Ji-oh's room from now on.

395
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,660
Of course. And you and I

396
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,496
can make a sibling for Ji-oh.

397
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,082
Honey!

398
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,917
-You pervert.
-Hey.

399
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,336
-But honey...
-Yes?

400
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,963
Didn't you move here when

401
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,923
-when A-jung entered college?
-Yes.

402
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,342
How is an elementary textbook here?

403
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,386
A-jung's like that.

404
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:39,223
Look. She still has all the scripts
from her past roles,

405
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,268
even when she barely had any lines.

406
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,396
These look like her contracts.

407
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,608
Jeez. Couldn't she have organized them?

408
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,861
I always have to clean up after her.

409
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,821
"Employment contract."

410
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,698
And...

411
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,243
What? "Marriage contract"?

412
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,748
"Lee Do-han and Na A-jung."

413
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,750
"Three-year-contract."

414
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,044
"Client and actress"?

415
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,319
Who are you?

416
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,822
Where's Na A-jung?

417
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,304
Did Do-han leave first?

418
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,434
Rolled omelet?

419
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,020
I love rolled omelet.

420
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,230
That looks amazing.

421
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,023
It's yours, sister-in-law.

422
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,401
I heard you always have breakfast.

423
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:14,944
This way, please.

424
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,038
You didn't have to.

425
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,125
Why is there only one bowl?

426
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,002
I don't eat breakfast, sister-in-law.

427
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,674
Still, I feel sorry eating by myself
in your house.

428
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,967
"Sorry"?

429
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,429
I should do this much
for my sister-in-law.

430
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,473
Why do you keep calling me sister-in-law?

431
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,850
Dear brother-in-law?

432
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,810
Because you're my sister-in-law.

433
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,770
Enjoy your meal.

434
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,189
Well, then.

435
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,778
Hey, just eat with me!

436
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,530
Hey, brother-in-law!

437
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,370
Hey, brother-in-law!

438
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:10,916
Great.

439
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,419
I made her breakfast, and I was polite.

440
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,880
I was a good brother-in-law.

441
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,259
Brother-in-law.

442
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:21,802
I'll do it.

443
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,597
No, I'll do it. Go and rest.

444
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,183
No, let me do it. It's fine.

445
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,267
No, really.

446
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,856
I'm sorry.

447
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,774
It was refreshing.

448
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,944
It's fine.

449
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,783
Excuse me.

450
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,952
How do I do the laundry?

451
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,121
Oh, and do you have a dryer?

452
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,374
Listen. I'll do it.

453
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,002
Please just go and rest.

454
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,136
Being a good brother-in-law is tough.

455
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,389
Please just sit still
so I don't have to see you.

456
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,231
Why would he try to act
in front of an actress?

457
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,149
Accepting me?

458
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,654
Calling me "sister-in-law"
when he doesn't even mean it.

459
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,388
With this, it's 1,000.

460
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,599
You folded these yourself, right?

461
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,601
You do this

462
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,562
when you make a wish.

463
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,274
You've acted weird since that day.

464
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,068
Don't play dumb.

465
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,362
It was about me, right?

466
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,407
Tell me what the wish was.

467
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,700
You don't need to know.

468
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:13,080
You were lying when you told me
to be happy with Do-han, right?

469
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,001
Tell me. What wish did you make?

470
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,421
Did you wish for me to leave Do-han?

471
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,549
No.

472
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,426
The opposite.

473
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,684
For myself to leave you alone.

474
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,353
I really meant

475
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,106
what I said that day.

476
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,946
And when I accepted you
as my sister-in-law, I felt so at ease.

477
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,075
The time I spent opposing you

478
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,870
felt like a waste.

479
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,756
But why are you saying that

480
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,011
as if you're pushing me away, Ji-han?

481
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,099
No matter what,

482
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,019
it means this is my place.

483
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:22,149
So, let's keep our places as in-laws.

484
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,449
Barging into my room

485
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,326
and digging through my trash.

486
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,205
You're crossing the line, aren't you?

487
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,572
Yes, I met him.

488
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,699
He knew you.

489
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,576
He knew you changed your lock too.

490
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,745
And that we're getting married.

491
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,665
He's your ex,

492
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,417
isn't he?

493
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,296
It was nice meeting you.
See you next time.

494
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,676
No wonder. His tone was weird.

495
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,054
But how did he know we're getting married?

496
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,432
And how did he know it was me?

497
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,151
A-jung, I might be late today.
Don't wait for me and just rest.

498
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,301
What is it?

499
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,553
Is it broken again?

500
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,263
You met A-jung.

501
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,640
Well...

502
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,267
I did.

503
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,351
By coincidence.

504
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,645
Coincidence?

505
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,564
Yes, by coincidence.

506
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,860
How odd.
There are a lot of coincidences around me.

507
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,447
Someone keeps
secretly taking photos of me,

508
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,657
and the power keeps shutting down
in my studio.

509
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:39,578
The person I'm marrying
coincidentally meets someone I know?

510
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,460
Don't you dare touch A-jung.

511
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,253
That's crossing the line.

512
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:50,798
You're upset.

513
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,676
As if you actually like her.

514
00:34:55,928 --> 00:35:00,015
What you said about hurting me,
is this what you meant? Revenge?

515
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,183
By threatening me?

516
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,851
Do-han.

517
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,729
You're the one crossing the line.

518
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,817
Don't you feel sorry toward me at all?

519
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,693
I don't.

520
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,780
No, I used to,
but you got rid of that just now.

521
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,115
So stop this now.

522
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,452
Stay out of my life.

523
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,986
Lee Do-han barely has
any connection to that man.

524
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,447
They only have one or two
mutual acquaintances.

525
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,741
Then there's nothing between them.

526
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:05,330
Oh, you seem to be clueless.
Such relationships are more interesting.

527
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:10,043
A conflict when they have no connection?
That means there's something going on.

528
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,213
What I want to know is what's going on

529
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:17,342
between Do-han, A-jung,
and Ji-han. Those three.

530
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,470
So wouldn't I get irritated

531
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,558
if you suddenly
bring up someone unrelated?

532
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,646
No, this means he's connected
in some way too.

533
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,525
Who knows?
He might be related to Na A-jung as well.

534
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,987
Then contact me when you find something.

535
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,072
Hang on.

536
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:43,869
Then

537
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,538
what would I get?

538
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:51,168
It might be a useful card for you,

539
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:55,547
but for me, releasing this
won't even have much of an impact.

540
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,426
I get what's in it for you,

541
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,304
but I don't get what's in it for me.

542
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,058
Just tell me what you want.
I hate beating around the bush.

543
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,484
Your mother's accident.

544
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,280
I want to stop being blamed.

545
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,034
Then it'll be a win-win situation.

546
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,371
Mr. Kang.

547
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,502
You know that sitting here with you

548
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,129
and drinking tea

549
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,841
doesn't mean I like you, right?

550
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,805
Even though she abandoned her family,

551
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,557
she was still my mother.

552
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,978
And you caused
the accident that killed her.

553
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,188
I haven't forgotten it.

554
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,272
That's why

555
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,942
I need to clear my name.

556
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,281
Aren't you curious

557
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,659
what truth will be revealed

558
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,744
once I do?

559
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,633
What's on your mind?

560
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,343
What?

561
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,469
It's nothing.

562
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,265
We should've gone to an aquarium

563
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,309
to celebrate me being on your hook.

564
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,645
I can show you my fish friends.

565
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,316
I'm getting introduced
to a lot of friends.

566
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,611
Fish friends, bird friends...

567
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,488
Bird friends?

568
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,032
Yes,

569
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,826
a thousand birds stuck in my house.

570
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,457
They're a huge pain in the neck,

571
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,084
making me

572
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,296
unable to do anything.

573
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,226
So how long is Ms. Na staying there?

574
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:14,770
I don't know.

575
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:16,897
Forever, I guess.

576
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,398
What?

577
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:21,610
They'll live together
once they get married.

578
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,862
They'll nest

579
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,447
in my house.

580
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,367
That's awful.

581
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,204
You should find your place.

582
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,999
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable
being with newlyweds?

583
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,377
It'll be better for you to come to me.

584
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,590
Don't worry.

585
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,843
I'm trying my best right now.

586
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,406
-Ji-ae.
-Oh, my!

587
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,492
It's me, let's go inside.

588
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:15,664
Ji-ae.

589
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,626
Do you

590
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,004
know that guy?

591
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,631
He's not, right?

592
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,508
Did he follow me here?

593
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,719
He's a regular.

594
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,596
Is he?

595
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,226
Darn it. This is so exhausting.

596
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,604
You should rethink about getting famous.

597
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,273
This is a huge pain.

598
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,941
It's not easy.

599
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,027
She thinks she's some celebrity now.

600
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,740
So how is it
living in your future husband's house?

601
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,326
Is his brother still bullying you?

602
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,411
No, he's not.

603
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:58,206
Wow, I guess he really did accept her.

604
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,959
He's finally on her side now.

605
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,838
But why do I feel more uneasy?

606
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,341
I preferred it when he just opposed me.

607
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,468
I understand.

608
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,470
You defeated him,

609
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,515
so you'd feel sorry for the loser.

610
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,017
Well, right.

611
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,687
But whenever he calls me "sister-in-law,"

612
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,732
I feel something heavy

613
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,026
in my chest.

614
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,861
It should be the opposite.

615
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,990
You should feel much lighter.
There's no one opposing you now.

616
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,118
All you have to do
is focus on your wedding.

617
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,205
Right, you're worrying for no reason.

618
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,166
Everything's going well. Why would you?

619
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,417
Right.

620
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,920
You think so?

621
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,971
Are you free after work today?

622
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,598
Why do you ask?

623
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,100
Go on.

624
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,941
Are you trying to start
that productive life project again?

625
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,901
No, it's not that.

626
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,070
How about some drinks?

627
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,031
That sounds great.

628
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,283
Drinks?

629
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,202
Is something wrong?

630
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,536
No, it's not that.

631
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,207
I just want to go home late.

632
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,006
I'll see you later.

633
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,927
-Honey, wait!
-Let go.

634
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,554
I have to tell her this is wrong.

635
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,181
But still...

636
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,475
Does she think marriage is a joke?

637
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,394
-I'm going to kill her.
-Honey.

638
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,437
-But...
-Na A-jung!

639
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,606
Honey, lower your voice...

640
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,150
The neighbors will hear you!

641
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,363
Su-jung? Tae-min?

642
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,242
A-jung! Run! I'll hold her back.

643
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,453
-Are you crazy?
-What's wrong?

644
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,247
-You lunatic.
-What is it?

645
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,541
-Have you lost your mind?
-What?

646
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,627
-Hey!
-What's with you?

647
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,963
What's with me? Seriously?

648
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,047
Here.

649
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:15,719
What is this?

650
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,180
A marriage contract?

651
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,227
I knew you were a fraud

652
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:28,606
ever since you pretended to be Mom
when your school called home.

653
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,318
A fake marriage? That's crazy!

654
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,236
-It's just acting.
-Hey!

655
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,447
Getting married as an act?

656
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,742
Do you want to go to jail as an act too?

657
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,494
Honey, let's hear her out.

658
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,538
I'm sure she had plans...

659
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,623
when she signed it.

660
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,712
It's my first lead role.

661
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,380
What?

662
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,675
I mean,

663
00:43:55,759 --> 00:44:01,556
my career wasn't getting anywhere,
and my dream seemed impossible to achieve.

664
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,560
And just as I felt that,
Do-han begged me so desperately.

665
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,188
Of course, I refused at first.

666
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,607
But once we talked,

667
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,817
the payment wasn't bad,

668
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,154
and it seemed like an okay job.

669
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,579
But I'm not sure anymore.

670
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:28,291
I thought I'd just be acting
in everyday life,

671
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,419
but I keep having to lie.

672
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,340
I thought it'd be a great role,

673
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,134
but I'm becoming a nuisance.

674
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,387
That's how I feel.

675
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:45,433
How could you say that right now?

676
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,769
Didn't you even think that through?

677
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,398
Hey. Did you think everything through

678
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:55,151
before getting pregnant with Tae-min
when you weren't married?

679
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,075
But what can I do?

680
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:03,660
I made my choice.

681
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,996
I have to stick with it until the end.

682
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,083
You idiot.

683
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,878
Do you have any idea
what'll happen at the end?

684
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,011
Su-jung!

685
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,473
You can't just leave like that. Come on.

686
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,809
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

687
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,895
I support you, A-jung.

688
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:36,860
Knives rust if you don't use them,
and your body stiffens if you don't move.

689
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,361
Acting is the same.

690
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,405
You can use this chance

691
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,407
to keep acting.

692
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,577
You're doing great.

693
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,370
I support you.

694
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,544
Fine, keep going with it.

695
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,296
It's your life.

696
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,090
Then keep my secret.

697
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:03,178
But don't get caught by anyone.
Especially Mom and Dad.

698
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:08,641
They already bragged about it
to our aunts who looked down on you.

699
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:11,311
They were so happy
you were getting married.

700
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,856
They'll feel hurt even if you break it up.

701
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,776
So get divorced quietly after three years.

702
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,197
Do you get what I mean?

703
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,782
Yes, Su-jung.

704
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,784
I'm sorry.

705
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,496
This is so annoying.

706
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,165
That bigmouth would've had a hard time

707
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,084
keeping this all to herself.

708
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,005
By the way,

709
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,174
with that much money,

710
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:44,427
you could get Father's head
to be as hairy as Bigfoot.

711
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:47,263
Bigfoot!

712
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:48,473
Hurry up!

713
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,350
Okay.

714
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,434
A-jung.

715
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,124
Drink up.

716
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:25,593
One more glass.

717
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,897
I had a lot to say to you,

718
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:39,691
but first,

719
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,820
let me tell you about a dream I had once.

720
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,323
It's still vivid in my mind.

721
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:50,827
In my dream, I grew a peach tree

722
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,912
in my front yard.

723
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,791
And the big, pretty peaches

724
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,293
suddenly

725
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,253
began to fall.

726
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,630
Was it before you had A-jung?

727
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,427
This is where she appears.

728
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,556
A huge dog suddenly ran in

729
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,017
and ate all those peaches.

730
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,561
It was terrifying.

731
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:21,441
And ten months later, A-jung was born.

732
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,236
Maybe because of that dream,

733
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,698
she was gluttonous and greedy.

734
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,241
She lunged at everyone

735
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:34,537
whenever she was upset, like a mad dog.

736
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:35,872
She was my child,

737
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,125
but it was so tough raising her.

738
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,002
It must've been tough.

739
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,309
I was happy

740
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,811
raising her.

741
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:05,693
Sometimes, I wondered
if she was literally sucking me dry,

742
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:09,238
and I got angry
when she wouldn't listen to me.

743
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:16,079
But strangely, I still felt
proud of her and grateful toward her.

744
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:21,501
I just want to ask you one single favor.

745
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,628
Of course, Father.

746
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,715
Don't

747
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,718
make her walk on eggshells.

748
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,012
Let her do what she wants

749
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,766
and express her feelings when she's upset.

750
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,896
That's how I raised her.

751
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,023
I will, Father.

752
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,110
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

753
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:51,989
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

754
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,742
You know,

755
00:49:55,702 --> 00:50:00,081
today's actually the first time
you've asked me to have a drink with you.

756
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,751
Congratulations.
You've seen a new side of me.

757
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:05,837
That's right.

758
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:12,677
By the way, why don't you want to go home?

759
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,554
My brother and A-jung

760
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,764
are nesting in my house.

761
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,644
I can relate to
the story of Hong Gil-dong now.

762
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,065
I don't want to call them at all.

763
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:29,277
That's different.
Hong Gil-dong didn't really have a choice.

764
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,486
Is that important?

765
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,614
The point is that I'm making an effort.

766
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,578
And with time, I'll get used to it,

767
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,955
then I'll feel more at ease, right?

768
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,250
That's a great way of thinking.

769
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,171
I've heard the expression,

770
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:52,300
"Fake it till you make it."

771
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,469
That's what people say.

772
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,013
That sounds nice.

773
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,225
I'm great at faking things.

774
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,228
Cheers.

775
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:15,948
My gosh.

776
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,909
-Hello.
-Hi.

777
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:20,787
How much did he drink?

778
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,497
Three glasses of soju.

779
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,623
-Three?
-Yes.

780
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,041
That's too much!

781
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,585
Tae-min, carry him. Come on.

782
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,422
Oh, my gosh.

783
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,673
He's wasted.

784
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,967
Jeez.

785
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:37,970
Is there something you want to tell me?

786
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,973
Keep in mind that I'm watching you.

787
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,017
Me too.

788
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,437
What are you two saying?
Stop the nonsense and go inside.

789
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,606
-Thanks.
-No problem.

790
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,526
Hurry home before A-jung worries.

791
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:00,117
Get home safely.

792
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:02,995
We're watching you.

793
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,179
What?

794
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:21,931
Hey, A-jung.

795
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:27,478
What are you doing out in the cold?

796
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,647
You called me

797
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,234
and said you had something to tell me.

798
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,945
Oh, right. I did.

799
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,697
Sorry.

800
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,490
You're drunk.

801
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:43,035
Go to bed. We can talk tomorrow.

802
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,581
No, I'll say it now. I want to say it now.

803
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,088
A-jung.

804
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:58,718
I know this will sound selfish,
but I'm so happy right now.

805
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,889
For the first time, I don't feel anxious,

806
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,474
thanks to you.

807
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,145
So I'll make you feel the same.

808
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,108
I'll be a really great husband.

809
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:19,238
I'll let you do anything you want,
and I'll take care of everything for you.

810
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:20,489
Okay?

811
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,617
Okay?

812
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:26,621
Go to bed.

813
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:28,706
Why?

814
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:31,417
I want to sit here a little longer.

815
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,046
Okay, I'll head inside first.

816
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,547
Don't stay out too long.

817
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:11,248
But don't get caught by anyone.
Especially Mom and Dad.

818
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,335
They were so happy
you were getting married.

819
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,838
They'll feel hurt even if you break it up.

820
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,384
So get divorced quietly after three years.

821
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:26,931
I know this will sound selfish,
but I'm so happy right now.

822
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,476
For the first time, I don't feel anxious,

823
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:33,145
thanks to you.

824
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,858
Don't worry.

825
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,361
Just trust your decision.

826
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,866
I think you made the right choice, A-jung.

827
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,667
You're not calling me "sister-in-law" now?

828
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:57,461
No.

829
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,008
Well, whatever I call you,
you'll be my sister-in-law.

830
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,512
That's good.

831
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,725
At least you're consistent.

832
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,729
But how are you so sure
when you don't know

833
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,524
what I was thinking?

834
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:23,904
I just don't want you

835
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,076
to be wavered about your decision.

836
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,873
It's the first time
hearing Do-han say he's not anxious.

837
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,459
But you'll be anxious instead.

838
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,592
I've thought about

839
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,096
everything that made me uneasy

840
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,683
about this marriage.

841
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,607
I can ignore everything except one thing.

842
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,948
I keep feeling uneasy about you.

843
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:17,458
I don't know why,

844
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:24,673
but I do.

845
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,429
I'm wavering.

846
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,768
So I want to ask you this

847
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,145
for the last time.

848
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,319
Are you really okay

849
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,906
with me marrying Do-han?

850
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,121
You really don't mind
if we become in-laws?

851
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,423
Yes.

852
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,094
I'll trust

853
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,222
my choice too.

854
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,751
Right.

855
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:28,005
If I keep faking it, I'll make it someday.

856
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:35,512
Your wish won't come true without this.
Keep it and fulfill your wish.

857
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,146
I guess you were right.

858
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,274
I'm so jealous of A-jung.

859
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:48,400
What?

860
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,446
This is why lottery tickets
don't matter much.

861
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,365
Even without it,

862
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,743
A-jung won the lottery
with a husband from a rich family.

863
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,995
Don't be ridiculous.

864
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,414
You have to win the lottery

865
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:05,042
with your own hands to enjoy it.

866
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,754
There's no fun in winning it
through someone else.

867
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,965
Why? I'd love that.

868
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:15,094
I'm sure A-jung's jealous of us right now.

869
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,178
What?

870
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:21,016
A-jung did all those part-time jobs

871
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,977
so she could keep acting.

872
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,940
She doesn't have to worry about money,
but she's told to stop working.

873
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,275
Would she feel happy?

874
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,110
Of course.

875
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,820
Don't you know the FIRE movement?

876
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,572
Young people these days
want to retire early.

877
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:39,952
You always go on about "young people"
when you're in a tight spot.

878
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,206
And if she really feels uncomfortable,

879
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,042
would she go for a wedding dress fitting?

880
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,555
Wow, it's prettier than I thought.

881
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,350
It's so hard to choose.

882
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,436
Let's just pick anything.

883
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,397
We can't do that. It's your wedding dress.

884
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,483
Hey, I used to wear a wedding dress
every weekend.

885
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:15,446
And I had dozens of grooms.
Let's get this over with.

886
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,656
We can take our time choosing.

887
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,868
You're the lead at this wedding.

888
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:43,307
I've thought about

889
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,643
everything that made me uneasy

890
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:50,064
about this marriage.

891
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,942
I can ignore everything except one thing.

892
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,239
I keep feeling uneasy about you.

893
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,662
Get a grip, A-jung.

894
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,933
Are you really okay

895
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,520
with me marrying Do-han?

896
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,992
You really don't mind
if we become in-laws?

897
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,925
What? Ji-han.

898
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,009
Come with me.

899
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:14,750
EPILOGUE

900
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,924
I won't send you back to Do-han.

901
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:08,011
I don't know what happened,
but I'll just trust A-jung and let it go.

902
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,098
What's the point of telling the truth now?

903
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,850
Do you really like Do-han?

904
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:19,022
You should stop popping up
here and there and meddling in my life.

905
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,567
