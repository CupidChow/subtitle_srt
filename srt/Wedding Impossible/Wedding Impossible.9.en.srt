1
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,938
-Well, I...
-I...

2
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,447
-I...
-I...

3
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,865
I hit you too hard.

4
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,326
I didn't mean to.

5
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,828
It's fine. I'm okay.

6
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,043
I didn't hit you like that on purpose.

7
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,003
Of course. I know.

8
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,221
-You're okay, right?
-The kiss.

9
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,350
The kiss we had.

10
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,688
You feel the same way, right?

11
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,235
Yes, I do.

12
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,737
But...

13
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,282
what do we do now?

14
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,869
About Do-han and...

15
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,627
Why don't we just think
about ourselves right now?

16
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,047
Even when I called you,

17
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,716
and said I liked you,

18
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,680
I didn't imagine it'd turn out like this.

19
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,642
Me either.

20
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,186
But I...

21
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,983
I feel so confused right now.

22
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,609
After all we went through,

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,530
we can't waste more time just worrying.

24
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,324
Let's just focus on each other

25
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:39,869
for one day.

26
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,421
Just trust me now.

27
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,733
YEONSEON EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

28
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,369
Can we get two tickets
for a bus that leaves now?

29
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,413
To where?

30
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,040
The farthest we can go.

31
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,459
Thank you.

32
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,214
Every time.

33
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,757
Regarding your marriage,

34
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,718
when you left five years ago,
and when Mom passed away...

35
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,096
Selfish bastard.

36
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,308
I always kept quiet.

37
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,354
I felt sorry that I wasn't trustworthy.

38
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,155
JI-HAN

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,325
Please.

40
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,912
Stop thinking about yourself

41
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,541
and think about others getting hurt.

42
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,099
EPISODE 9

43
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,862
We're really here.

44
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,572
Yes, we are.

45
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,867
And at a great place.

46
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,497
Wow.

47
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,878
BASED ON WEDDING IMPOSSIBLE
BY SONG JEONG-WON

48
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,605
Isn't it beautiful?

49
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,859
It's certainly different
from staying up drinking.

50
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,988
You do look at things differently.

51
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,741
That's why I'm an actor.

52
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,744
Speaking of which,

53
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,997
how about chowing down
on some hangover soup?

54
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,208
Hey, that's enough.

55
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,460
Having hangover soup at this timing?

56
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,671
And did you actually say "chow down"?

57
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,964
Not just eat?

58
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,133
You don't like it?

59
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,260
Of course I do.

60
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,597
I'll smile at whatever you say right now.

61
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,648
It feels like a dream

62
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,400
to be here with you.

63
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,500
Okay, then.

64
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,794
Let's keep this clear.

65
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,964
For the next 24 hours,

66
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,800
we'll focus on each other
and do what we want

67
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,177
without worrying about other people.

68
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,848
We're just here as Male 1 and Female 1.

69
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,144
No one knows us,
and we don't know anyone here. Okay?

70
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,064
What?

71
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,733
All right.

72
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,987
Why don't we just be strangers?
That would be easier.

73
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,492
Nice to meet you.

74
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,202
I'm Lee Ji-heon.

75
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,831
I was hanging out nearby,

76
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,168
and I fell in love with you
at first sight. Will you date me?

77
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,545
Don't you think that's too corny?

78
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,089
Maybe. But I'm sure my looks aren't.

79
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,009
Don't you want to get to know me?

80
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,682
I feel like it'll get quite messy, but...

81
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,938
But where are we going?

82
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,441
Let's go chow down.

83
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,385
You really chowed down on it.

84
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,512
I chow down on everything.

85
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,556
Keep that in mind, okay?

86
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,643
Was your name Neo A-jung?

87
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,854
Yes, Mr. Lee Ji-heon.

88
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,189
Want anything else?

89
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,316
Any meat or sundae?

90
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,362
We're not done yet,
so I should leave some room for snacks.

91
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,489
You really are thorough.

92
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,784
By the way, you know my tastes
a little too well

93
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,161
when we only just met.

94
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,206
It's really suspicious.

95
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,999
Suspicious?

96
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,461
If your ideal guy
has similar tastes as yours,

97
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,921
that means it's fate.

98
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,798
I never said you're my type.

99
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,758
I'm always someone's type.

100
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,801
Am I really not?

101
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,928
You are.

102
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,644
What is this?

103
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,148
You said you lived
in the next neighborhood.

104
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,651
You should dress accordingly.

105
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,028
What an excuse.

106
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,363
Having fun, are you?

107
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,282
Excuse?

108
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,077
The styling is important
for expressing a character.

109
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,870
You can get immersed more.

110
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,123
Then Ji-heon,

111
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,834
try this on.

112
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,878
It would really get us immersed.

113
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,800
I should pick mine.

114
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,471
Let's see.

115
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,812
This one

116
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,731
or this one.

117
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,857
Which is better?

118
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,608
They're both pretty.

119
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,152
Just get both.

120
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,821
No, just buy everything.

121
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,489
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

122
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,366
I'll buy everything over here.

123
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,326
Oh, no.

124
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,161
Can I try these on?

125
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,912
-Sure.
-Thank you.

126
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,290
There's no point doing this.

127
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,083
You're rich to the bone.

128
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,627
Why don't you hold yourself back a bit?

129
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,046
I'll go try these on.

130
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:41,892
You look good.

131
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,561
You look pretty.

132
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,730
Let's go.

133
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,205
How about a hat?

134
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,250
It suits you.

135
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,008
How do I look?

136
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,010
Where have you been?

137
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,512
And why did you ignore my calls?

138
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,350
You're the one
who told Ji-han, aren't you?

139
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,271
What the hell were you thinking--

140
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,773
You shouldn't be worrying about that.

141
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,066
What?

142
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,985
A reporter came to see me.

143
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,617
REAL FACT NEWS
KANG IK-JUN

144
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,081
You told him too?

145
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,335
How far are you going to take this?

146
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,128
It depends on you.

147
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,756
I'll take it as far as you take it.

148
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,594
Jung Dae-hyeon.

149
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:27,599
You keep talking as though you're
a victim. What did I ever do to you?

150
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,017
You feel like a victim

151
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,605
when you were blamed
for something you didn't do.

152
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,858
Things like the photos
or the studio electricity.

153
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,818
And today too.

154
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,997
REAL FACT NEWS
KANG IK-JUN

155
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,377
So what do you want?

156
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,548
What exactly is Lee Do-han's relationship
with Na A-jung?

157
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,300
It seems like you were quite close.

158
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,594
"Were"?

159
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,639
It's different from being close now.

160
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,849
Past relationships tend

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,936
to end with only hatred.

162
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,690
And from my experience,

163
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,026
people are much closer
to money than people.

164
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,907
I'll protect your identity
and compensate you,

165
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,076
so just help me out.

166
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,370
I don't want to.

167
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,163
Pardon?

168
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,584
I said no.

169
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,130
I said the reporter came to me,
not that I told him.

170
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,174
I never said I did,

171
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,760
but you just accused me.

172
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,430
I can't trust you anymore.

173
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,849
I'm sure you brought it up

174
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,059
just to torment me.

175
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,144
Well,

176
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,523
it could be

177
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,025
to warn you.

178
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,780
Seriously? After all you've done?

179
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,741
There could be more

180
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,288
than just hatred left between us.

181
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,873
Not for me, at least.

182
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,958
You seem to be the one

183
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,628
I should be careful of the most.

184
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,215
Are you sure...

185
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,595
what you're doing is right?

186
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,932
Marrying someone you don't even love

187
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,810
because you're afraid to show yourself,

188
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,981
always running, worried about
when your secret will be out.

189
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,401
Is that really right?

190
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,830
I just love it here.

191
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,832
Should we live here?

192
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,502
How about that big house?

193
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,756
I'd like that house over there.

194
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:09,094
It has a garden.
We can plant flowers and vegetables.

195
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,889
Mister, can you help me?

196
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,183
Me?

197
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,351
What is it?

198
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,144
Are you hurt?

199
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:23,483
I hurt my back a while ago.
But I have to carry this fertilizer.

200
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,194
-Oh, I see. We'll help.
-Thank you.

201
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,704
You really don't have to do this.

202
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,331
This isn't hard.

203
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,208
Keep resting, ma'am.

204
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,004
You're so pretty and good at this.

205
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,716
I learned a lot of things, just in case.

206
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,386
I once dug up sweet potatoes all day
just to learn farming.

207
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,388
That's praiseworthy.

208
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,689
If you're done,
come and pick weeds with me.

209
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,358
Sure.

210
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,705
Let me see.

211
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,584
The scythe seemed old.
I won't get tetanus, will I?

212
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,711
Don't be dramatic.

213
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,132
If you tell yourself the cut isn't deep,
it'll heal in no time.

214
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,676
Maybe if you blow on it.

215
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,016
Happy now?

216
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,147
Where are you going? It still hurts.

217
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,283
ROOM AVAILABLE

218
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:02,999
I feel much better.

219
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,418
You barely did anything.

220
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,589
Don't you see this cut?

221
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,136
Did you enjoy the food?

222
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,305
You're an awesome cook.

223
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,848
We really enjoyed it.

224
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,141
I'm glad.

225
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,604
It's late. If you have nowhere to sleep,

226
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,856
you can stay the night here.

227
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,192
I'll give you a room at a cheap price.

228
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,374
I didn't think it'd just be one room.

229
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,417
It's a cliché.

230
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,795
This always happens.

231
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:53,800
Like when you're stuck on an island
because the ship stops sailing.

232
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,637
There's only one room
when you need a place to stay.

233
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,515
It's so cliché,
it doesn't even surprise me.

234
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,312
Are you all right?

235
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,314
What?

236
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,400
Are you worried about me?

237
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,651
I think I should.

238
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,820
You look...

239
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,406
really anxious right now.

240
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,742
No, I'm not. I'm fine.

241
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,036
Why wouldn't I be?

242
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,206
We shared a room in Busan

243
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,543
and lived under the same roof
for a few days.

244
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,229
So,

245
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,734
you didn't find out anything
from that guy?

246
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,950
You seem to love
taking things without effort.

247
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,368
You shouldn't.

248
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,793
-What is it this time?
-Just look.

249
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,055
What is this?

250
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,724
While I was looking into him,

251
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,560
I had one of my guys follow those two.

252
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,648
Yes, this is what I wanted.

253
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,275
Clear proof.

254
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,780
You should've done it sooner.

255
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,823
I was almost disappointed in you.

256
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,036
You're sure about what you promised me?

257
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,538
The truth about your mother.

258
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,623
Of course.

259
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,835
We're looking into the witnesses
and CCTV footage from the accident.

260
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,422
This is getting interesting.

261
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,693
This room's cozy and nice.

262
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:24,659
Are you asleep?

263
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,370
For real?

264
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,455
A-jung.

265
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,416
A-jung.

266
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,795
I'm not asleep.

267
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,089
So stop calling me.

268
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,800
I can't sleep because of you.

269
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,888
You keep gulping
and turning left and right.

270
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,098
When did I do that?

271
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,269
You're so weird. You could've just said
you weren't asleep.

272
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,733
Does it hurt that much?

273
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,661
You stopped bleeding.

274
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,705
It'll heal soon.

275
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,001
You're saying that as if it's nothing.
It really hurts.

276
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,128
Are you always this whiny?

277
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,880
Only to those I want to whine to.

278
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,593
Then continue your whining tomorrow

279
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,678
and go to sleep now.

280
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,931
I'm exhausted
after walking around all day.

281
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,686
Good night.

282
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,937
Good night.

283
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,787
What are you doing?

284
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,166
You're up.

285
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,586
I just couldn't sleep.

286
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:42,880
Why not?

287
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,175
Thinking about going back tomorrow?

288
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,305
I wish the day was 48,

289
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,766
no, 72 hours long

290
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,227
instead of 24.

291
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,023
Do you like being with me that much?

292
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,694
Why didn't I notice

293
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,196
when you like me so much?

294
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,453
By the way,

295
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,583
when did you start liking me?

296
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,670
I mean, how did you end up liking me?

297
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,172
I told you.

298
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,215
I tried to seduce you,

299
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,261
but I ended up liking you instead.

300
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,140
I was so startled

301
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,268
that I actually got sick.

302
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,731
I did too.

303
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,649
I did all sorts of things

304
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,902
to try to forget you.

305
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,864
I even believed in
the Deoksugung stone wall myth.

306
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,033
The Deoksugung stone wall?

307
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,662
Oh, the day of our family meeting?

308
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,999
The paper cranes!

309
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,133
The paper cranes too?

310
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,888
I'm right!

311
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,434
You really made an effort.

312
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,520
Then when did you start liking me?

313
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,442
I felt strange

314
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,820
at the Deoksugung stone wall.

315
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:35,868
You finally said
that you'd accept Do-han and me.

316
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,080
But it made me feel empty.

317
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,708
I didn't feel happy when you were

318
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,419
finally accepting me.

319
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,006
It felt like there was a hole in my heart.

320
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,718
Then at the dress shop,

321
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,137
you held my hand and ran with me.

322
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,932
I yelled at you, looking angry,

323
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,268
but I was happy.

324
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,236
Do-han and I were going to get married,

325
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,572
but I kept feeling something else.

326
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,202
So I was at a loss

327
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,997
and didn't know what to do.

328
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,500
And right then,

329
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,087
you appeared and saved me from it all.

330
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,216
I was grateful.

331
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,553
What if

332
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,140
you met me before Do-han?

333
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,354
It would've been nice

334
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,482
if we'd just met as strangers

335
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,111
instead of Do-han's brother

336
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,823
and Do-han's girlfriend.

337
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,994
That would've been nice.

338
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,371
We're going to face

339
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,207
a lot of difficulties from now on.

340
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,503
It'll be tough.

341
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,173
But...

342
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,011
let's stay together.

343
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,348
Let's not hide

344
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:22,892
our feelings

345
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,312
or act.

346
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,756
We'll post the irregular personnel rating
you've ordered tomorrow.

347
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,926
All right.

348
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,261
Did Do-han decide

349
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,764
to take over the company?

350
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,810
Well, what can he do if I force it

351
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,061
into his hands?

352
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,354
He'll do it.

353
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,815
And I've told him in advance.

354
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,358
By the way,

355
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,070
the new position
I'm trying to give Ji-han.

356
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,072
What do you think?

357
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:21,826
He was in charge of LJ Shopping Mall,
so he'll do a great job.

358
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,538
And he has a good reputation
within Taeyang Group.

359
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,916
-Is that so?
-Yes.

360
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,960
It must be thanks to Chae-won.

361
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:35,005
Anyway, this is the perfect time, right?

362
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,555
One day is so short.

363
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,557
Right.

364
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,101
It felt like a dream.

365
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,604
I feel so sad.

366
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,943
I'll talk to Do-han.

367
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,612
No, I should talk to him.

368
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:02,783
Well, I'm the one ending things with him.

369
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,494
-I should tell him.
-No.

370
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,875
Before we tell him about us,

371
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,084
I have something

372
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,838
to talk about with him.

373
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,299
Besides, we didn't make up

374
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,468
after fighting that day.

375
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,056
I know it might sound ridiculous
right now,

376
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,642
but I really care for him.

377
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,104
I don't want him to get hurt.

378
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,566
I know you feel uneasy,

379
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,110
but please,

380
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,820
trust me

381
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,573
and give me time.

382
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,784
It won't take long.

383
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,786
All right.

384
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,081
I'll wait, then.

385
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,042
I'll call you after I talk to him.

386
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,210
Okay.

387
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,339
-Bye, then.
-After you go in.

388
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,817
What is all this?

389
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,529
I've prepared this for you, Ji-ae.

390
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,281
I made it myself. It's all cooked by me.

391
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:28,160
Wow, he made five boxes.

392
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,789
Right, but why are you giving this to me

393
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,541
instead of A-jung?

394
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:38,295
That had nothing to do with me.
I didn't make those lunch boxes.

395
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:41,173
Right, he made all this himself for you.

396
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,802
Look, his face grew slimmer
after all that work.

397
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,098
Thanks for noticing, Jong-hee.

398
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,891
You're so kind.

399
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,812
You two seem quite close,
calling each other by your first names.

400
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,898
I'm going to the bathroom.

401
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,283
Is this what you mentioned last time?

402
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,951
Yes, it is.

403
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,161
I'll send you the money.

404
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,997
-It's 30 percent off, right?
-Yes.

405
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,666
This is awesome.

406
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,296
Can you please stop eating this?

407
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,380
What?

408
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,465
It's a precious lunch box for Ji-ae.

409
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,260
Oh, okay.

410
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,179
-Got it.
-Thanks.

411
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,307
Have this. There are lots of these.

412
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,478
What's with him?

413
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,440
Is it Jong-hee this time?

414
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,907
Ji-ae!

415
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,577
You're not even trying the food?

416
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,662
Just leave.

417
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,706
-Ji-ae.
-Jeez!

418
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,459
Stop hanging around me!

419
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,546
You're so harsh.

420
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,175
You know how I feel.

421
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,511
I didn't say it directly, but you know

422
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:11,972
I like you.

423
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,433
Why aren't you saying it, then?

424
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,811
If I do, you'll reject me.
Then I won't be able to

425
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,313
see you anymore.

426
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,941
But why are you being so friendly
to A-jung and Jong-hee?

427
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,027
Jeez...

428
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,573
How many times do I have to tell you?
A-jung has nothing to do with me,

429
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,991
and as for Jong-hee...

430
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,454
I contacted her to ask more about you.

431
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,581
I swear it on you.

432
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,334
Why would you swear that on me?

433
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,002
Then what else

434
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,714
can I do for you right now?

435
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,425
Don't do more for me.

436
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,428
Do less for others!

437
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,181
-What?
-It makes me jealous!

438
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,810
I like you too!

439
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,140
Hey, Ji-han.

440
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,641
Do-han.

441
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,102
You weren't at home.

442
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,980
-Are you at the studio?
-Yes, for now.

443
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,858
I need some time to think alone.

444
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,278
Things are a bit...

445
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,489
complicated.

446
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,033
Is something going on?

447
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,410
No.

448
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,995
And I think

449
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,456
you'd need time as well.

450
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,710
I'll contact you
when everything's sorted out.

451
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,879
We can talk then.

452
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,089
I'm ready anytime,

453
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,258
so tell me when you are.

454
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,638
I have something

455
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,099
I want to tell you too.

456
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:20,976
All right.

457
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,770
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,962
Ji-ae's so bold.

459
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,883
"It makes me jealous! I like you too!"

460
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,011
I miss her. I should leave work early!

461
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,309
What's going on?

462
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:06,021
There's a post about
a sudden personnel change. Did you know?

463
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,275
Mr. Lee is promoted to team leader?

464
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,446
What kind of
random personnel change is this?

465
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,616
It is a sensational promotion, though.

466
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,326
Congratulations.

467
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,953
I knew you'd make it.

468
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:25,541
Then we're no longer on the same team?

469
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,376
What? You're right.

470
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,920
And Do-han...

471
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,797
BRAND STRATEGY TEAM
DIRECTOR: LEE DO-HAN

472
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,976
You've done a great job.

473
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,564
Thank you, sir.

474
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,030
Oh, right.

475
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,618
Join your grandpa for a meal next time.

476
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,374
"Grandpa"?

477
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,167
Grandpa...

478
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,503
Did I hear...

479
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,172
-Did I hear that right?
-"Grandpa"?

480
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,310
Mr. Lee.

481
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,605
Congratulations.

482
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,482
What just happened?

483
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,527
Well, this is what happened.

484
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,363
In front of everyone,

485
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:45,996
the chairman said,
"Join your grandpa for a meal."

486
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,750
He said "grandpa."

487
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,669
He's announced to everyone

488
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:55,213
that you're his grandson.

489
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,800
-Why, though?
-It's time he did.

490
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,970
Because you've achieved so much here.

491
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,600
Oh, and also because of Ms. Yoon.

492
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,771
I sneakily asked Mr. Kim just now,

493
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,942
and it seems Ms. Yoon and the chairman
were still in touch.

494
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,612
He seemed satisfied,
saying your wedding could be

495
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,656
earlier than your brother's.

496
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,035
Still playing dumb?

497
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,079
How cute.

498
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:31,333
So, when did you

499
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,044
get so far with Ms. Yoon?

500
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:35,796
You never told me.

501
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,214
It's not like that.

502
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,508
I'll get upset if you don't tell me.

503
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,887
-Mr. Lee.
-I'll be out.

504
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,722
Coy Ji-han!

505
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,849
Stop playing dumb!

506
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,229
The person you are calling...

507
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,276
Chae-won, we need to talk.

508
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,988
I don't feel like it now.

509
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,656
It won't take long.

510
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,205
Fine, then.

511
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,128
You finally called me first.

512
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,506
So what is it?

513
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,843
Grandpa seems

514
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,096
to be mistaken about our relationship.

515
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,932
He still...

516
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,309
I mean,

517
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,813
he thinks things are going well.

518
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,109
So I'm going to be honest.

519
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,029
I like A-jung.

520
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,286
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,751
You're admitting it after all.

522
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,881
I know I told you to be honest,
but now I kind of regret it.

523
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,800
You'll meet someone much better than me.

524
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:06,011
Someone good
and someone I like are different.

525
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:12,017
Ji-han, I've never failed
to get what I wanted.

526
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,643
It'll be the same this time.

527
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,356
Do you really think it would
work out between you two?

528
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,942
What about Do-han?

529
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,362
And everything you've achieved?
What will people think?

530
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,448
Can you give up everything?

531
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,699
Can you handle it?

532
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,786
Really? You really think so?

533
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,540
Yes, it's okay.

534
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,878
Would she be okay with it?

535
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,507
"The woman who fell in love
with her brother-in-law."

536
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,343
That label will follow her.

537
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,195
He's preparing
to hand over the company to Do-han.

538
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:09,908
Let's say we can take care of Do-han.

539
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,201
But this is...

540
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,203
Are you sure about Do-han?

541
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:17,124
Of course! But Ji-han's different.
Did you see his eyes?

542
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,167
They're filled with ambition.

543
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:22,587
It's as if he's shouting "This is Sparta!"
when he looks at us.

544
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,174
Having Ji-han in the picture

545
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,552
is making it way too difficult for us.

546
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:32,806
Why are you making such a fuss?

547
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,767
You should be making a fuss.

548
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,853
How are you so calm right now?

549
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,355
To be honest,

550
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,608
if you hadn't framed us and made us fight,

551
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:47,237
we wouldn't have been pushed aside
by those two.

552
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,322
This is all your fault!

553
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:51,783
No, it's not.

554
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,952
It's all thanks to me.

555
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,996
You're still out of it.

556
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:01,376
Min-woong, stop whining
and just wait quietly.

557
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,170
You'll see something fun.

558
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,798
The higher you go up,

559
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,426
the stronger the pain is when you fall.

560
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,055
No, wait.

561
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,308
Just pay to watch the show.

562
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,809
You little...

563
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,937
Wait. I guess
you don't even have the money.

564
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,314
You brat...

565
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,612
Damn it. What do we do?

566
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:32,324
I don't know either!
My head's about to explode.

567
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,952
Listen carefully, honey.

568
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:40,040
If we look at our situation objectively,
we're doomed right now.

569
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:44,753
There's no chance of taking over LJ.
We have to find a way to survive.

570
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,171
Honey.

571
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:50,383
You're so amazing. I wake up
in the middle of the night feeling angry.

572
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,637
How can you
still assess our situation calmly?

573
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,389
I feel angry too.

574
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,684
But at this rate, we won't get anything.

575
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,063
The thought of living humbly
when we're old

576
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,607
was a wake-up call for me.

577
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,320
The best we can do right now

578
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,905
is to unify a candidate.

579
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,699
Seung-a or Do-han and Ji-han.

580
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,247
We have to decide which side to support
to gain something in return.

581
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:25,126
We're never supporting Seung-a.

582
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,505
I'll never take that traitor's side,
no matter what.

583
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,882
Right, I agree.

584
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,886
She's all talk and no action.
I can't trust her anymore.

585
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:39,057
But Do-han and Ji-han
won't just let us join them.

586
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,935
I have my ways.

587
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,438
What is it?

588
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,898
He must be a bit late.

589
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,820
I can't accept this marriage!

590
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,446
That's total nonsense.

591
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,157
-Change the channel.
-This isn't drama.

592
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,827
-It's pure chaos.
-Why? What is it?

593
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,745
Come with me.

594
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:04,124
Whatever the circumstances,

595
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:07,585
how could they fall in love
when they are in-laws?

596
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,048
What's wrong? Do you need water?

597
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:15,760
I'm fine.

598
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,262
Keep watching.

599
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,972
I love him.

600
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,350
It must be painful for them too.

601
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,145
I mean, she betrayed her husband,

602
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,564
and he betrayed his brother.

603
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,233
How will they cope with the guilt?

604
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:34,112
There's nothing that they can say
to justify what they did.

605
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,196
Of course.

606
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,367
They could still have something to say.

607
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,747
I mean, there could be

608
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,333
some sort of story behind it,

609
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,585
and some relationships

610
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:52,589
could actually be very legal and ethical

611
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,924
and moral and stuff.

612
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,176
What?

613
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,970
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense

614
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:00,638
while eating?

615
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:05,477
By the way,
where were you all day yesterday?

616
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,937
Isn't it obvious?

617
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,647
She must've met Do-han.

618
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,568
They live apart now, so they must have

619
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:15,779
missed each other.

620
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,489
It's not that.

621
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,539
You should finish your meal!

622
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,084
She hardly ate again.

623
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,310
If it weren't for Do-han's secret,

624
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,730
I'd tell them it's fake.

625
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,305
Over here!

626
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,433
What?

627
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:29,978
Hey.

628
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,023
I can't believe him.

629
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,451
You're crazy. My family could've seen you.

630
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,290
I didn't know you talked
to Do-han already.

631
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,584
Did it go well?

632
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,629
It didn't?

633
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,048
It's not that.

634
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:03,178
I just came because I wanted to see you.

635
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,223
-You're lying.
-I mean it.

636
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,144
Seriously.

637
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:13,813
It's not because of Do-han.

638
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,858
We decided to talk later.

639
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,944
Then what is it?

640
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,448
I can tell something's up.

641
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:27,660
I finally

642
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,206
got acknowledged as Grandpa's grandson.

643
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:36,794
And Do-han's going to take over
the company soon.

644
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,340
That's what you wanted all along.

645
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,508
Yes, it is.

646
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,677
It is what I wanted,

647
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,223
but I'm not so excited.

648
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,561
Because of me?

649
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,735
Right.

650
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,112
You can't be happy.

651
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:08,159
If you date me, you'll lose everything

652
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,954
and you'll get scorned by everyone.

653
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,957
It's not because of that.

654
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,001
If I can be with you,

655
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:21,172
I think I can give up everything.

656
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,340
No,

657
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,759
I know I can.

658
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,512
I can do it,

659
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,431
but maybe not you.

660
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,352
So I wanted to ask.

661
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,856
Will you really be okay

662
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,901
even if that happens?

663
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,529
I'm already prepared for it.

664
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:48,616
All right.

665
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,285
Then it's fine.

666
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,415
It must be painful for them too.

667
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,667
I mean, she betrayed her husband,

668
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,086
and he betrayed his brother.

669
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,839
How will they cope with the guilt?

670
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:04,757
But Ji-han...

671
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,553
I mean...

672
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,013
I'm really okay.

673
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,267
The worst that can happen
is getting kicked out.

674
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,563
Then I'll have an excuse to live with you.
That sounds great.

675
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,482
But still...

676
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,694
Is this funny to you?

677
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,945
It's not funny,

678
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,364
but I want you to smile.

679
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:30,116
How can I?

680
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:34,120
Still, don't cry.
I didn't say this to make you cry.

681
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,499
I just wanted

682
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,711
to be honest with you.

683
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:47,050
We promised not to have secrets or lie.

684
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,469
Tell me everything

685
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,763
honestly from now on.

686
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,570
Why couldn't I get in touch with you?

687
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,865
Were you ignoring my calls?

688
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,784
Like I ignore yours?

689
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,161
What brought you here?

690
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,748
I wouldn't have come just to say hi.

691
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,000
No news is good news.

692
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,961
But you've brought news,

693
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,713
so it can't be good.

694
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,256
Right.

695
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,300
You understand me better than Min-woong.

696
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,553
It's such a shame.

697
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,806
You should've been born into our family.

698
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,516
I'm busy. Get to the point.

699
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,519
Even if you're not,
I wouldn't want to stay.

700
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,234
You heard about the personnel change?

701
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,403
Congrats, and...

702
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,738
And?

703
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,157
I offer my condolences.

704
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,869
Something interesting's
going to happen soon.

705
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,288
I wanted to tell you in advance.

706
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:43,750
I just couldn't hold myself back
from talking.

707
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,878
What could it be?

708
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,631
Here.

709
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,230
What's this?

710
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:08,483
I came here to see this reaction.

711
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,817
What is this?

712
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,696
I guess you can't even guess what it is.

713
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,116
Look at the photo below that first, then.

714
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,076
Here.

715
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,330
They're entering a hotel together,

716
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:27,251
and she's running with him
in her wedding dress.

717
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,130
It must be tough, Do-han.

718
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,216
But

719
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,051
this is your brother.

720
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,389
You brothers are really unbelievable
in many ways.

721
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,514
A-jung.

722
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,560
We need to talk.

723
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:41,951
Right.

724
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,912
Let's be honest.

725
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:53,379
So why did you want to talk to me?

726
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,507
Come on, we're closer than this.

727
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:59,385
We have time. Let's catch up a bit first.

728
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,971
But I have nothing to ask you.

729
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,807
I don't think you should have time.

730
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,310
-Shouldn't you be busy?
-What?

731
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:11,480
People are talking about
how you were abandoned by the chairman.

732
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,987
There's been a small misunderstanding,

733
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,780
so I just took a step back.

734
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,199
Because I'm generous, right?

735
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,410
I don't think so.

736
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,247
I heard you were
out of the picture entirely.

737
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:30,041
Who said that? Seung-a?

738
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,792
That little bitch!

739
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:38,341
You're right, Chae-won.

740
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,884
We know it too.

741
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,721
We also know you don't like us much.

742
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,601
It's true we were hostile
toward Do-han and Ji-han until now.

743
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,354
-And?
-But...

744
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,732
we're on the same side now.

745
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,569
Min-woong and I decided
to let go of our greed

746
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:00,947
and stand on Do-han and Ji-han's side.

747
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,367
We're going to be a family soon.

748
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,577
That's right.

749
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,204
And family

750
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,748
is about helping each other out.

751
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,918
The three of us can all help each other.

752
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,171
Helping each other?

753
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,217
Then it's clear what I can do for you two.

754
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,929
Helping you get
at least one subsidiary, right?

755
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:27,932
You're smart!

756
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,850
But how can you two help me?

757
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,311
We can, of course.

758
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,732
We will become a family,

759
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:39,110
but it's in the future tense.

760
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,446
It hasn't happened yet.
And we're part of that family.

761
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,572
Right.

762
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:47,618
There's a limit to the info
you can get about our family.

763
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:50,162
We'll give you that info.

764
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,749
Well, there isn't much I want to know--

765
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,875
Seung-a!

766
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,461
Seung-a

767
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,549
is planning something against Ji-han.

768
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,605
Where are your manners?

769
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,358
The one who has more to lose
should show manners.

770
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,694
-What?
-Do I seem easy to you?

771
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,114
You're still close with that reporter.

772
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,243
Didn't I clearly warn you last time?

773
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,828
I get it now.

774
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,292
This is about Ji-han and A-jung, isn't it?

775
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,795
You know, but you're smiling.

776
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,714
Why would I not?

777
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,678
You should've listened to me.

778
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,555
I even showed you the photo.

779
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:55,061
Or do you still not believe me?

780
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,855
I have more obvious pictures.

781
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,690
-Seung-a.
-Yes?

782
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:00,983
Maybe I should

783
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,446
show you how Taeyang will react
if that scandal gets out.

784
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:10,034
Will anyone turn
against Taeyang to take your side?

785
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,830
I think they'll kick you out of LJ first,
at least.

786
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:21,253
Let's not get dirty.

787
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,255
End things here.

788
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:26,383
It'll get messy for both of us.

789
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,721
Bye, then.

790
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:32,848
Bye.

791
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,741
Do-han's not home again.

792
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,955
He should still sleep here
even if we don't talk yet.

793
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,001
Things are a bit...

794
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:03,379
complicated.

795
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,880
No way...

796
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,601
I'm glad you called.

797
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,939
I had something to tell you too.

798
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,359
Something to tell me?

799
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,486
What is it?

800
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,951
Why don't we tell Ji-han

801
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,163
that this is a fake marriage?

802
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,668
Why?

803
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,171
Well, I--

804
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,505
Because you like him?

805
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:49,425
What?

806
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:54,722
So it's true.

807
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,769
Even after seeing the photos,
I didn't want to believe it.

808
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,822
Do-han.

809
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:16,911
I'm sorry, Do-han.

810
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:21,165
I know I shouldn't do this to you.

811
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,753
I do, so I tried to hold myself back,

812
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,089
but I just couldn't.

813
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,553
Since when?

814
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:38,015
Was that after Ji-han found out I'm gay?

815
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,267
What?

816
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:44,021
Ji-han knows what?

817
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,733
Then you two started...

818
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,488
seeing each other when he didn't even know

819
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,325
that this was fake?

820
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:57,910
What?

821
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,245
What do you mean?

822
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,927
What are you talking about?

823
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,265
"Fake"?

824
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,058
Ji...

825
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,644
Ji-han.

826
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,312
Ji-han.

827
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:18,198
Lee Ji-han!

828
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,325
I...

829
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,202
I can't trust you anymore.

830
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:25,748
Why aren't you picking up?
Why are you avoiding me?

831
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:28,542
How could you cheat on him
before the wedding?

832
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,669
And with your brother-in-law?

833
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,004
I still care about him.

834
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,631
I'm going to protect him.

835
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,009
If you care about them,

836
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:39,094
you shouldn't just sit and watch.

837
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:40,971
The press conference is ready.

838
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,640
I won't run away this time.

839
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,351
I'm going to protect Ji-han

840
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,354
and myself.
