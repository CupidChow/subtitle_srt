1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,810
   
   

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,700
   
   

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,100
   

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,200
   

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,870
     

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,080
   

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,270
   

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,230
   

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,620
   

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:45,260


11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,090
   

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,290
 The day when someone's death 

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,570
 was the start of a new life for someone else. 

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,240
I absolutely cannot.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,580
It's absurd that my wife, whom I never had contact with, only appeared after her death.

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,180
Now, you want me to raise the children she had with another guy as my own?

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,200
Is that why you were so quick to liquidate Soo Hyeon's stocks and real estate and add it to your account?

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,080
Was that the reason you didn't divorce her and were separated?

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,620
Ji Han, go over there and sit.

20
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,780
There is no place for you to sit in this house.

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,160
 I realized one thing in the midst of the unfriendly stares. 

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,860
Son-in-law Choi.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,240
Listen to me carefully—

24
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,490
I'm Lee Ji Han.

25
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,690
Are you my grandfather starting today?

26
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,020
 If there is no place for me, 

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,170
 I can just create space for me. 
   

28
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,190
   

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm sorry I'm not the one you're waiting for.

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,890
Why would you say such a thing?

31
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,880
I was waiting for you, Secretary Kim.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,800
For me?

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
Tripling your salary coupon,

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,110
special promotion coupon,

35
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,280
overlooking a major mistake coupon.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
This is...

37
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,870
I graduated from elementary school now.

38
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,780
I've finished assessing the situation somewhat.

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,160
Please put in a good word for me and Do Han to Grandfather.

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,030
If you support us well, I'll make sure you can use those coupons.

41
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,520
 Even if nobody's on my side, 

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,740
 I just have to pull them to my side. 
   

43
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,360
Ji Han.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,010
Let's please stop now.

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,710
We pulled three straight all-nighters!

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,500
It's only been three days?

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,650
We only have two days until the exam.

48
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,390
Okay.

49
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,170
If you're sleepy, go wash your face.

50
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,720
When you come back, explain to me why you got this answer.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,090
I keep getting it wrong.

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,450
 Even when there seems to be no hope. 

53
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,430
   

54
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,840
♫  Every time I see you  ♫

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,490
♫  Three, two, one! Be mine, LJ!  ♫

56
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,620
♫  I love you, oh, LJ!  ♫

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,000
They're the new employees we hired through blind recruitment.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,780
♫  I will protect you to the end  ♫

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,930
Blind?

60
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,700
♫  LJ, I'll take responsibility for you to the end  ♫

61
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,360
♫  Be mine, LJ! You know me  ♫

62
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,330
 Even though I couldn't see what I hoped for, 

63
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,480
 I thought I could attain all of it if I just tried harder. 

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,390
 After running tirelessly all these years, 

65
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,300
 I was just one step away from obtaining everything. 
   

66
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,440
 It was really just one more step... 

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,220
 So, where did that woman suddenly come from? 

68
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,280
Hey, Na A Jeong. By chance, would you be willing to marry me?

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,410
 And why hadn't I known all this time? No, never mind. 

70
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,070
 More than all this, the thing that drives me crazy the most... 

71
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,360
Please, marry me.

72
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
No!

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,720
 Why now of all times... 

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,830
 Why at this extremely important timing 

75
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,440
 did that woman appear? 

76
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,780
He called for Do Han.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,040
Grandfather is waiting there like that. Is there any other option?

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,110
Someone should go and fix the situation.

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,210
   

80
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,720
Hello, I'm Yoon Chae Won of Taeyang Corporation.

81
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,230
What? Why is she over there?

82
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,920
Did Grandfather decide to go through with announcing the marriage?

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,900
Oppa, what are you doing?

84
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,440
You should order someone to cut the power or something.

85
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,220
I don't have anyone to give orders to.

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,610
I sent them somewhere else to look for something urgent.

87
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,620
That woman. The one Lee Do Han is supposedly dating.

88
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,070
I heard she's here.

89
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,130
- What? 
 - She's here.

90
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,200
 Before the chairman makes an important announcement, 

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,740
 I'd appreciate it if you could spare me some of your time. 

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Hey, Lee Do Han, what is this situation?

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,620
I'd need to know the situation for me to go along with you.

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,550
Go to my car in the parking lot for now.

95
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,180
Okay.

96
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,150
- You had a car? 
 - I'll explain everything later.

97
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,180
Wait for me a bit. Hurry up and go.

98
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,820
I mean, he should at least tell me where he parked.

99
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,580
Even if I try to just guess, I need to know the range.

100
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,640
He's gotten weird since I last saw him.

101
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,020
Excuse me.

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,270
By chance, were you with Lee Do Han just now?

103
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,780
- Who are you? 
 - Please come with us for a moment.

104
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,480
Executive Director Choi Min Woong wants to see you.

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,270
And who is that?

106
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,640
If he wants to see me, he should come himself. Why tell me to come?

107
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,150
You can hear the explanation later when you get there.

108
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,180
Why are you doing this?

109
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,210
I'm uncomfortable around strangers. I don't need to hear anything from you people.

110
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,190
Hey! I have a very loud voice.

111
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,210
If you do this here, things will get messy for everyone.

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Give me the key.

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,750
I said, give me the key!

114
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,090
Or will you go with them?

115
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,630
   

116
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,620
Gosh, that really hurts.

117
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,540
It doesn't seem like it's a dream.

118
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,060
Lee Do Han?

119
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,760
You're the one trespassing.

120
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,240
Why are you sneaking around like a thief and getting scared?

121
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,920
- Where is this place? 
 - I guess you don't remember what happened yesterday.

122
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,800
I do remember.

123
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,120
I ran away from very suspicious people with a less suspicious you.

124
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,180
You suddenly showed up looking like some low-quality ninja turtle.

125
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,250
That was because I was afraid people might see me with you.

126
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,450
I'm only asking because I'm curious,

127
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,400
but aren't you going to thank me for helping you?

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,660
Questions are answered on a first-come, first-serve, and I asked first.

129
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,310
I asked where this is.

130
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,010
You said you loved him and whatnot, but I guess Brother never brought you home.

131
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,840
You said you loved him and whatnot, but I guess Brother never brought you home.

132
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,970
This is...

133
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,850
really Lee Do Han's house?

134
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,650
Why does he live in a place like this?

135
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,550
You must've really hurt your head badly.

136
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,970
Oh, right! My head...

137
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,680
Why is my head like this?

138
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,730
That's what I want to ask you.

139
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,200
Why are you like that?

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,040
You jumped out of a moving car.

141
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,380
 Give me my contract. 

142
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,580
 Gosh, what's with my luck today? 

143
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,320
 Today is full of people telling me what to do. 

144
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,070
 Give it to me. You said you would bring my contract. 

145
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,380
 Happy? 

146
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,190
 I'll get off, so stop at that major road up ahead. 

147
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,260
 One more thing. Promise me to forget everything my brother said. 

148
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,400
 About what? 

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,660
 You know, about... 

150
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,240
 what he asked you to do earlier. 

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,510
 Oh, marrying him? 

152
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,090
 Honestly, I'm also confused about what I just heard earlier. 

153
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,130
 But I'll discuss that with him in person. 

154
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,320
 I'm saying this because I can't seem to get through to him. 

155
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,590
 And that decision is for him to decide. 

156
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,470
 Until you promise, you can't get off. 

157
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,220
 You are entering the children's safety zone. 

158
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,480
 Follow the speed limit. 

159
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,470
 To explain a bit about myself, 

160
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,090
 I'm second-degree in hapkido and taekwondo, 

161
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,150
 and I've attended action school for three years. 

162
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,920
 Are you saying you will hit me or something? 

163
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,620
 No. I'm saying if I was just a little less pretty, you would've seen me at the Olympics. 

164
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,000
 It also means if the driver doesn't let me off, 

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,800
 I know the landing techniques to jump out safely. 

166
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,080
 - You're joking, right? 
 - No. 

167
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,490
 This woman must be crazy! 

168
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,310
Right, right. I remembered.

169
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,100
But I'm sure I jumped out after calculating the speed and angle...

170
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,730
   

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,210
 Na A Jeong. Na A Jeong, wake up! 

172
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,680
 Na A Jeong! 

173
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,020
 What? Is she dead or alive? 

174
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,620
Shouldn't you have taken someone who might have a concussion to a hospital first?

175
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,280
We're not that close for me to act as your guardian twice.

176
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,620
Don't worry.

177
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,940
Paramedics said nothing was wrong with your brain.

178
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,490
But Do Han's younger brother, no—

179
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,360
Lee Ji Han,

180
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,340
you asked me yesterday if I was a fake, right?

181
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,800
You're right.

182
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,370
I lied to Do Han.

183
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,970
You don't need to tell me what I already know.

184
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,460
But I think Lee Do Han lied to me, too.

185
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,890
I have known him for 15 years.

186
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,770
That's a long time.

187
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,800
To think that everything about him for the past 15 years might be fake...

188
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,700
That is what I'm most worried about right now.

189
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,170
So, I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me everything

190
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,720
you know, honestly.

191
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,770
Does Lee Do Han go around committing fraud?

192
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,760
 Yes, Professor. Yes, yes. 

193
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,650
 Thank you so much for yesterday. 

194
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,300
 It mustn't have been easy for you to come to my house at that late hour. 

195
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,630
 Yes. Yes, I'll pass that on. Yes, yes. 

196
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,380
 Okay. 

197
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,620
   

198
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,300
Of course, I know. He would never do that.

199
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,000
But usually, it's easier for people who look so nice

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,130
to do something devious in secret.

201
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,950
Honestly, I thought it was strange that he was in New York.

202
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,770
He could do art here.

203
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,600
He loves banquet noodles and chicken feet.

204
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,850
So, why would he live where there are no Korean street food vendors?

205
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,100
Don't you think so?

206
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,900
But when you add the word "Flee," everything makes sense.

207
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,720
The one who ordered his secretary to search for me yesterday.

208
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,780
His name was Choi Min Woong, right?

209
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,140
I remembered he was the one following Do Han.

210
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,950
But what if he was also a victim?

211
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm getting goosebumps. Everything makes sense.

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
I didn't think this through.

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,400
Hurry inside and get changed so we can get your head examined.

214
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,700
No, no. My head is perfectly fine.

215
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,690
The arranged marriage, being a successor,

216
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,230
and living in a house like this. None of this makes sense.

217
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,800
How do you explain any of this?

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,200
I mean...

219
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
fraud...

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
or...

221
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,900
are you saying he's a second-generation chaebol?

222
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,700
Not second-generation. Third generation.

223
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,420
Our grandfather is Chairman Hyeon Dae Ho.

224
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,300
And the man who was looking for you viciously was my half-brother.

225
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,200
So, what you heard yesterday

226
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,720
was my brother's name being officially announced as the successor of LJ.

227
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Did you just say LJ Group?

228
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,620
But he says he will blow off that incredible opportunity.

229
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,320
For what?

230
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
All because of you.

231
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,340
I think I answered you pretty honestly and helpfully.

232
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,800
So you should answer me now.

233
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
You really didn't know any of this?

234
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
And you're not acting like you didn't know it?

235
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,140
With our stocks tumultuous at the moment,

236
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,420
you also must feel tumultuous, Grandfather.

237
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,700
There is so much talk in and out of the company about owner risk

238
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,900
and you lost face, Grandfather.

239
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,300
He cried all night last night, so upset.

240
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,700
Even if you're an adult, family issues hurt you for life.

241
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,220
He got so many calls from people and reporters about the illegitimate child controversy.

242
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,050
- Nice shot! 
 - Good shot!

243
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,760
I also have pride.

244
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,790
It's upsetting that I got pushed out as your eldest grandson.

245
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,140
But the one who pushed me out isn't even on the family registry.

246
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,470
That guy isn't part of our family, Grandfather.

247
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,250
Look at what's going on now. Our entire family is on the chopping board because of him.

248
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,140
He should be begging for forgiveness.

249
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,370
But where is he? Where is he?

250
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,460
He's nowhere to be seen.

251
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,390
It shows that he lacks basic character and he doesn't care.

252
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,960
Just look at yesterday!

253
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,450
If he had any thoughts at all,

254
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,400
would he have brought that woman?

255
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,000
What do you mean by a woman?

256
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
What do you mean by that?

257
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,140
You don't know about that, right?

258
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,220
The real reason Lee Do Han refuses to marry Chae Won.

259
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,600
What?

260
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
He has a girlfriend he's been dating for a long time.

261
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,890
Not only that, he brought that woman with him yesterday!

262
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,000
   

263
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,230
So, you're really the grandson of LJ Group's chairman?

264
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,000
And you're saying we should deceive the chairman by getting married?

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,800
You told me before you wanted to act in a drama with this kind of story.

266
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,600
I'll cast you, A Jeong.

267
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,100
Please act as my wife for just three years.

268
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,180
After that, I'll make sure we get divorced.

269
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,310
Are you crazy?

270
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,620
No matter how much I think about it, you're the only one I can talk to about this.

271
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,800
At this rate, I'll either get married or get found out about my sexual orientation.

272
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,060
Do Han, I think you're trying to use your courage in a weird way.

273
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,440
Rather than a melodrama where you're forced into a fake marriage,

274
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,490
isn't a family drama where you confess your secret and everyone understands you better?

275
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,730
Is there a family drama with an illegitimate gay son?

276
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,780
The same thing happened five years ago.

277
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,430
I almost got married then, too.

278
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,910
 Don't mention it. 

279
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,100
I was going to reveal everything then.

280
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,440
I couldn't spend the rest of my life deceiving an innocent person.

281
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,920
   

282
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,970
 Hello? 

283
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,040
 What's wrong? Is something the matter? 

284
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,850
When I saw that, I suddenly came to my senses.

285
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,690
Rather than worried, I got scared.

286
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,520
I was actually grateful

287
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,600
that it happened while I wasn't there.

288
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,030
After that, all I could think was one thing.

289
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,940
I wanted to run from this situation.

290
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,220
If I must get married anyway, I want to marry you since you know my situation.

291
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,160
What I need is not someone to help me inherit the company

292
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,540
but someone to help me escape from the company.

293
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,210
Escape, my foot.

294
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,160
Who are you, James Dean?

295
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,320
Are you supposed to be a rebel without a cause?

296
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
If he gives it to you, take it.

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Of course, you should take it. It's LJ.

298
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I finally understand why your younger brother was making such a fuss.

299
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,700
A Jeong,

300
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
I'm not joking right now.

301
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,830
You're good at acting.

302
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,100
You can do all the acting you love, and I can escape this situation.

303
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,180
So, you're saying you don't need a princess but Joan of Arc.

304
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,750
But did you know that

305
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,490
a princess is forgiven for whatever sins she commits,

306
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,000
but Joan of Arc was burned at the stake despite saving her country?

307
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Burned at the stake!

308
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,020
And did you think I'd deceive people and throw myself into flames as long as I'm cast?

309
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,500
Did you think I'd get excited and say okay if you just paid me?

310
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,400
I also have a sense of my professional calling.

311
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
And is a family register some kind of ending credit

312
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,300
that you'd add to it and take it off like that?

313
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,900
I promise it won't cause you any harm.

314
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,230
What if we get caught?

315
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,470
What will you do if we get caught?

316
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,630
Is the legal team at a major corporation like LJ only there for show?

317
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,590
Look here.

318
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,500
If your grandfather decides to hold a grudge against me,

319
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,950
I may have to pay 20 billion won while trying to earn 2 billion!

320
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,450
Screwing over some other guy's life is scary,

321
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,000
but screwing over my life is fine?

322
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
What kind of contradiction is that?

323
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,440
A Jeong...

324
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,740
And you say I know your situation?

325
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,690
Didn't you hide too much from me for you to say that?

326
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,480
Seriously, 15 years of friendship is meaningless.

327
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,580
Now that my trust in you is broken, you seem like a stranger.

328
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,400
I want to leave.

329
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,710
If Executive Director Choi inherited the management rights as planned,

330
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,570
things wouldn't have gotten this complicated.

331
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,780
Because the chairman suddenly announced his successor,

332
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,240
we're also facing a headache.

333
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,970
That's why those of you here at least need to make the right choice.

334
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,040
Are you asking us to suspend the construction of the

335
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,450
new shopping mall complex in Myeongju again?

336
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,430
Even the city is nagging us to sell it to a competitor

337
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,200
if we're going to delay any longer. So we can't suspend it.

338
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,100
It's better to come up with a reason rather than to create another headache.

339
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,190
I have one more younger brother besides Lee Do Han.

340
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:49,060
If the real person in charge of that project is that younger brother,

341
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,410
wouldn't it become an even bigger headache later?

342
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,300
I want it so badly.

343
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,740
Is it something like that?

344
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,100
A foundational change?

345
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,500
You know, even the woodcutter acted like he refused the golden and silver axes,

346
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,000
before taking it all home in the end.

347
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,050
Do you think my brother is after something bigger?

348
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,680
I don't know.

349
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,890
Right now, the only thing bigger to your brother is that woman.

350
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,370
- Team Leader Eun. 
 - Yes?

351
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,260
Can't you see I'm taking copium right now? 
  (Lying to oneself to cope) 

352
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,800
Did I say I wanted to hear facts right now?

353
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,700
I'm sorry.

354
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,000
What I need to hear are sweet things.

355
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,700
Not the name, Na A Jeong.

356
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,580
The angry chairman and your brother who angered him are not picking up their phones,

357
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,970
so what else can you do?

358
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,710
I'm the one who's most pissed off.

359
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,540
My precious tower is about to collapse because of an ant hole!

360
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,150
- Do you know how I climbed up here? 
 - Now, now.

361
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,250
First, calm down and breathe deeply.

362
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,930
Over here.

363
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,480
Let's get back to some copium.

364
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,300
How! How!

365
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,030
If an ant hole appeared,

366
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,430
you should squash the ant coming through the hole.

367
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,110
Then, filling up the hole would be an easy task.

368
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,780
Ant?

369
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,270
Na A Jeong.

370
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,480
What's going on? What's with the mood?

371
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,850
What do you think?

372
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,450
The stocks that the small investors here bought a couple of days ago dropped steeply.

373
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,110
You said it was trustworthy information.

374
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,810
You said it will rise like crazy.

375
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,000
That's why I said I wouldn't buy it!

376
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,010
What are you going to do about my severance pay!

377
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,160
But honestly, a surprise successor announcement like this...

378
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,110
Even God or Buddha can't predict that.

379
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,590
Hey, Dad! Why are you being so hard on him only?

380
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,530
If you have something to say, say it to LJ's chairman.

381
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,890
Their stocks fell because he revealed he had an illegitimate grandson—

382
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,780
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - All right!

383
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,220
I could only count on my eldest daughter.

384
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,090
I don't care about some illegitimate grandson or successor! My stocks better rise!

385
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,880
You already got water sprayed on your face. Blood will be spilled in this family!

386
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,690
Gosh, stop it! Seriously.

387
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,030
Talking about the stocks from the morning, geez.

388
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,980
Also, that severance pay account—

389
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,330
Honey, come inside for a moment.

390
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,570
Hurry!

391
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,800
Are you okay?

392
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,420
I don't have much of an appetite...

393
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,340
Honey!

394
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,620
This won't do.

395
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,340
At this rate, my husband will die of stress.

396
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,060
Hey, Sis, let's move up our plan.

397
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,050
- What plan? 
 - It's Dad's 60th birthday next month.

398
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,720
You said we should get him hair implants.

399
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,300
Let's bring that up a bit sooner.

400
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,400
Did I say such a commendable thing?

401
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,270
What's this? You skipped on Dad's birthday gifts for several years to save up for that.

402
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,350
You're not going to say otherwise now. Are you?

403
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,500
No, it's not that, but...

404
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,900
Dad is totally looking forward to it.

405
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,510
I've looked into a hospital for it,

406
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,100
so you just send the money.

407
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,600
Honey!

408
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,480
 I didn't do it intentionally, 

409
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
 but I'm sorry for hiding it all this time. 

410
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,070
 I didn't mean to hurt you. 

411
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,090
 Also, my offer is still on the table, 

412
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,940
 so I'd appreciate it if you'd consider it positively again. 

413
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,060
- Is it good? 
 - Yeah.

414
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,730
I... I received a proposal.

415
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,390
From my best friend of 32 years, at that.

416
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,660
- What! 
 - Wait, wait.

417
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,320
From that guy who came from New York?

418
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,690
He's not even asking you out. Go directly to marriage from being friends suddenly?

419
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,470
He liked you? Since when?

420
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,680
Hey, there's no such a thing as "suddenly" between a man and a woman.

421
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,500
You just switch modes after sleeping together.

422
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,400
Wow, no wonder you've been singing

423
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,180
"Let's go to my house" all the time lately.

424
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,010
Gosh, seriously... Shut up! Shut up!

425
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,420
Why am I trying to talk to such low-class people?

426
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,290
Okay, okay, let's talk about something more classy.

427
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,980
Did he say that with some money saved up? You don't have money.

428
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,690
He says he's rich.

429
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,120
He also has a car, a house, and his own company.

430
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,490
He didn't say he had a jade mat?

431
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,870
He didn't try to sell it to you?

432
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,840
I'm being serious. Don't be like this.

433
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,140
But you said he was an okay guy.

434
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,190
Wasn't he the only guy you've ever praised like that?

435
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,300
You're right, Unni. Lee Do Han is a really good friend to me.

436
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,200
 I won't ever do this part-time job again. 

437
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,710
 There was a reason why people said not to do it. 

438
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,860
 I told you this job was hard. 

439
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,470
 Why did you have to drag me into it when I said no? 

440
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,490
 Come on! At least we earned a lot of money. 

441
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,060
 My performance won't be a failure after investing all of my hard-earned money, right? 

442
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,590
 Of course not. 

443
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,300
 God, may many people come to my first-ever performance. 

444
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,360
 In Jesus' name— 

445
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,620
 Please let many people come! 

446
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,020
 - Please let many people come. 
 - Yes. 

447
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,790
 Amen. 

448
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,580
 What are you going to do with this money? 

449
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,420
 I will invest it in you. 

450
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,230
 - In me? 
 - Yeah. 

451
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,010
 Hey, your hair is going to fall into your noodles. 

452
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,330
 Hey, lift your head! Why are hanging your head like you're some criminal? 

453
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,200
 It is a crime. 

454
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,380
 You invested your hard-earned money into my performance, but it was a complete failure. 

455
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,660
 Okay, okay! It was hard-earned money. 

456
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,050
 I just spent my hard-earned money where I wanted to. 

457
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,870
 A Jeong, it's better to give than to receive. That's what friends are for. 

458
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,590
 I'm happy! I don't regret it. 

459
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,730
 What's with your expression? I guess you're really grateful. 

460
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,800
 Then, just pay me back in the future with great acting. 

461
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,070
Still, how could he think of getting it back with marriage?

462
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,540
You guys get along, and you guys aren't seeing anyone. So what's the problem?

463
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:36,270
Unni, why don't you ask him to help your father get hair implants if he's that rich?

464
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,280
Hey, am I Simcheong that I'd get sold off to get my dad's hair implants? 
  (Korean folktale) 

465
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,670
Why not? Though your father may not have raised his children well,

466
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,870
he may be successful in growing his hair.

467
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,840
So annoying. Forget it.

468
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,990
I'm going to my part-time job. I'm late.

469
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,070
You got a part-time job?

470
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,600
Of course! Would I just loaf around?

471
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,970
I need to work hard and earn money to get my dad's hair implants.

472
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,740
I'm leaving.

473
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,760
You should clean up before you go!

474
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,360
Cleaning is your job, and eating is my job.

475
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,350
 Jungle expedition! 

476
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,320
Friends, we have to run away quickly!

477
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,330
Kids, you can't tell that hunter where we are. Okay?

478
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,600
 Okay! 

479
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,580
Did you see a monkey?

480
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,640
 Over there, over there! 

481
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,940
 There, there! 

482
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,310
Everyone, thank you so much!

483
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,200
Thanks to your help, we were able to survive.

484
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,300
To thank all of you, we prepared candy for you guys.

485
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,190
Are you ready to receive your candy?

486
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,360
 Yes! 

487
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,040
There is no use in running away.

488
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,790
I will end you for sure.

489
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,310
After you fell off the horse, you became a monkey chased by a hunter, I see.

490
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,490
Yes, since I'm short on money.

491
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,230
I was too discourteous that day.

492
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,990
I pushed you too much, right?

493
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,650
Why are you suddenly apologizing to me?

494
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,760
Have you decided to use a different method now?

495
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,450
Yes.

496
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,590
It's an appropriate amount of compensation money.

497
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,520
It's not the amount you mentioned, but I prepared it sincerely.

498
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,490
Enough so that you won't be short on money for a while.

499
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,750
I see.

500
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,350
But based on my statistics,

501
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,100
I always got indigestion whenever I ate what was around in a hurry.

502
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,390
Whether it's food, men, or even this money.

503
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,550
Sounds like you've eaten badly many times before.

504
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm old enough to know that I should watch what I eat before it becomes an issue.

505
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,720
This isn't our family money.

506
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,020
It's my money I saved up every month once I got hired.

507
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,990
It won't become a problem,

508
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,810
so just think about your happiness while spending that money, Na A Jeong.

509
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,180
By now, you should know

510
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,580
that if Brother would naturally go back to his place once you go away.

511
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,930
When I think about it, you brothers are like an umbrella and salt vendor.

512
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,430
One asks me to marry him, and the other asks me not to.

513
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,560
Who should I listen to?

514
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,370
Listen to the umbrella vendor.

515
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,800
If it's the umbrella vendor...

516
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,830
Do Han?

517
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,390
I'm the umbrella vendor.

518
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,370
What can I get for you?

519
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,700
Please give me two cold iced Americanos to go.

520
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,490
Okay.

521
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,670
You're an LJ employee, right?

522
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,260
By chance, do you remember me?

523
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,440
You come in every day. You drink iced even in winter.

524
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,190
Yes. That's me.

525
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,910
I'm actually a warmhearted guy inside, so I always need to cool off with a cold drink.

526
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,870
Otherwise, people say they'll get burned.

527
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,960
Oh, it's just a joke.

528
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,080
- Oh, I see. 
 - Yes...

529
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,980
Could you give me your number?

530
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,520
Pardon?

531
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,370
Sir, could you input your number yourself?

532
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,710
Pardon?

533
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,390
The number to collect your stamps.

534
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,900
Yes. My nails are a bit short... I was going to input it.

535
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,630
It's 010-0613-8593, Eun Taek!

536
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,200
Oh, I see.

537
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,120
It's Taek. Like Taek from the Reply series.

538
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,200
It's two syllables like Super Junior's Eun Hyuk.

539
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,170
What took you so long?

540
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,320
I keep getting it wrong with my predictions.

541
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,770
She doesn't interact with Young Master Do Han often.

542
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,410
But she accepted the money as if she was waiting for it?

543
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,880
Very strange.

544
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,520
Right?

545
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,300
It was too weird, huh?

546
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,480
You feel that way, too?

547
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,980
She got in the accident as if she was timing it.

548
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,170
Just like insurance fraud.

549
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,330
I should have just stopped at Taek. Taek!

550
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,300
You're the one who committed fraud! What will you do now?

551
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,210
You said the chairman found out about that woman Na A Jeong.

552
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,190
You said Lee Ji Han is a skyrocketing stock.

553
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,810
Is this what I get for serving Lee Ji Han night and day?

554
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,170
Is it? Freefall?

555
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,310
Taek.

556
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,920
The market hasn't closed yet.

557
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,050
The successor position is still open,

558
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,890
and if we hang in there, we will be victorious one day.

559
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,970
On Young Master Ji Han's elementary school graduation,

560
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,720
do you know who I saw in him?

561
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,660
Again, again... 
    

562
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,850
Who? Yi Bang Won with his hidden claws? 
  (Third king of Joseon Dynasty) 

563
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,610
Hey, once the feud between brothers gets underway,

564
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,510
he's the type who will slaughter everyone to rise to the throne.

565
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,200
Then, he should just hurry up and do so.

566
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,050
Why is he trying to get a Jeongjong like Lee Do Han on the throne? 
  (Second king of Joseon Dynasty) 

567
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,830
Of course, because of that accident.

568
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,760
The accident that led to President Hyeon Soo Yeon's death.

569
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,730
 How could he sit on that throne 

570
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,720
 when he thinks his parents died because of him. 

571
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,160
All right. This is the basic sketch.

572
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,070
The amount of hair follicle implants will be different based on the design.

573
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,560
Though lowering the hairline like this is more expensive,

574
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,710
it will make your hair look much fuller.

575
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,680
I do like this design,

576
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,400
but my daughters are paying for it.

577
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,960
Gosh, Dad. Don't worry.

578
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,280
Go with whichever one you like, Dad.

579
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,410
Oh, yes. Fill in his hairline tightly.

580
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,620
So, it looks like he has a lot of hair.

581
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,190
Full and abundant.

582
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,610
We're going to collect your hair through incisions,

583
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,550
and it will cost you 6.3 million won in cash today.

584
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,710
We'll pay it in one advance payment. Is there any discount?

585
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,710
No, there isn't.

586
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,650
I see, okay.

587
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,550
 This isn't our family money. 

588
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,380
 It's my money I saved up every month once I got hired. 

589
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,630
Hey.

590
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,700
- Yeah? 
 - What are you doing?

591
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,090
No, it's nothing. I should send the money.

592
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,400
 It won't become a problem... 

593
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,150
Yeah, he said this money won't become a problem. Let's just use it.

594
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,340
 So, just think about your happiness while spending that money, Na A Jeong. 

595
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,250
I'm sorry.

596
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,550
We'll just come back next time.

597
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,460
- Pardon? 
 - I'm sorry.

598
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,380
- Hey. 
 - Dad,

599
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,630
I'll let you get double the implants next time with your hair all the way down here.

600
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,170
Really, I promise. Let's just go home for today.

601
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,770
Just a moment.

602
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,580
Hey, Sis. What are you saying after we've come all this way?

603
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,290
I feel like I'll lose my conscience trying to help Dad grow some hair.

604
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,090
Let's just go.

605
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,490
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,920
We'll come back next time. We're sorry. Dad...

607
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,250
Oh, oh, oh... I think you should get your hair implants, though...

608
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,600
   

609
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,410
   

610
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,930
I don't think there's anything more to talk about.

611
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,590
I guess you had an unnecessary change of heart?

612
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,320
Do you know what the meanest thing in the world is?

613
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,740
To give something and take it back.

614
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,040
I said to spend it. I never said I'd take it back.

615
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,400
You added extra comments. You told me to spend it.

616
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,810
So, why did you say how you saved up that money every month since you got hired?

617
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,510
You know, I was told it was okay to touch lottery money

618
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,980
but you shouldn't touch maturity savings.

619
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,080
So? You won't take this money but take my brother's instead?

620
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,210
That damn brother, brother, brother talk.

621
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,350
People without a brother must be so sad.

622
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,920
- Have a drink first. 
 - No, thank you.

623
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,870
As a rule, I don't drink with people I don't know.

624
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,360
Since it'll be boring to drink by myself, I guess I'll just call Do Han.

625
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,330
Let me ask you something.

626
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,570
Why are you getting so involved in Do Han's business?

627
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,820
I only want one thing.

628
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,200
For Brother to be happy.

629
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm saying that's really weird.

630
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,160
That's not the mindset of someone who is younger.

631
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,780
Typically, it's normal for younger brothers to think about how they can take

632
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,500
their brother's clothes, things, and food.

633
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,130
But wanting his happiness?

634
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,580
That gives me goosebumps.

635
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,660
Don't people say it's brotherly love instead of giving goosebumps?

636
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,320
Do you owe your life to Do Han for something?

637
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,670
Yes.

638
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,550
I was able to live thanks to my brother.

639
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,850
My happiness is Brother's happiness.

640
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,550
So, if Brother is supposed to have something, I want that to be the very best.

641
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,070
Still gives me goosebumps.

642
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,000
In my world, this is normal. Do you have a problem with that?

643
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,550
No. That won't be a problem,

644
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,000
but I feel like it will be suffocating.

645
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,300
Are you saying I'm choking my brother or something?

646
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,240
No. I'm saying it must be suffocating for you, Lee Ji Han.

647
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,930
Your facial expression as you say you want your brothers happiness

648
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,520
seems very anxious and nervous for some reason.

649
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,450
I briefly wondered if Do Han can truly become happy when he sees that expression

650
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,270
for a split second.

651
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,060
No thank you.

652
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,780
I don't drink more than one glass with someone I don't like as a rule.

653
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,820
I made up my mind not to be Do Han's lover anymore.

654
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,200
If you still say no, oh well.

655
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
I didn't accept your money,

656
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,050
so I was going to tell you to pay for these drinks.

657
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,820
I guess I should call Lee Do Han now.

658
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,890
You better not change your mind later.

659
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,760
She's Do Han's high school classmate.

660
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,850
She was the first person he met after returning to South Korea.

661
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,580
After looking into it,

662
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,430
it's also true she came to your birthday banquet, Chairman.

663
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:29,420
It seems to me that Do Han was going to introduce that young lady to you, Chairman.

664
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,650
She's quite late in coming home.

665
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,680
I don't think you'll get to meet her today. Should we come back next time—

666
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,090
Well...

667
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,560
It's that young lady?

668
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,090
The one Do Han is supposedly dating?

669
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,940
I think so...

670
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,050
Chairman.

671
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,760
That's...

672
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,140
- Na A Jeong. 
 - Yes?

673
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,810
I said I'll walk you home.

674
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,480
I said, I'm fine!

675
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,700
I can go by myself.

676
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,600
I just have to go straight from here. Straight.

677
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:20,580
Gosh, how do I know if you will go straight home or make a U-turn toward my brother's house?

678
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,410
Were you the type who follows a girl you don't know home when you get drunk?

679
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,590
Yeah! What if I follow you home?

680
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,560
You talk as if I'm a wolf or something.

681
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,050
No.

682
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,100
I'm a 32-year-old fox who's more dangerous than a wolf.

683
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,090
Oh, you're so scary! I am going to go home—

684
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,350
You're way too drunk.

685
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,540
I'll have to take you to your house.

686
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,780
I should take you to your house.

687
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,360
Taxi.

688
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,080
- Taxi. 
 - A taxi came.

689
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,610
Taxi! It's a taxi.

690
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,470
♫  Where should I go?  ♫

691
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,050
♫  Ahjussi!  ♫

692
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,820
Ahjussi, please take us to his house.

693
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,160
Gosh, no, please take us to her house first.

694
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,620
Gosh, we should go to your house first, Young Master.

695
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,110
Please take us to his house first.

696
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,730
Please drive safely.

697
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,420
Okay.

698
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,740
His grandfather is LJ Group's chairman.

699
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,150
He's a really important person!

700
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,090
I told you not to tell people that!

701
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,000
My grandfather won't like it!

702
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,090
- But why? 
 - I don't know.

703
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,800
My grandfather never liked me.

704
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,040
Why?

705
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,000
Brother also doesn't like me, and you don't like me, either.

706
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,120
- Everyone hates me! 
 - That's not true!

707
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,710
- Everyone hates me! 
 - That's not true!

708
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,300
I like you!

709
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,130
I like anyone who buys me drinks!

710
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,370
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

711
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,300
- Then I'll buy you drinks again! 
 - Oh, really?

712
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,400
- Yeah. 
 - Whoa!

713
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,990
You're the best! The absolute best!

714
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,460
You're the best!

715
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,950
I can actually talk to you now that you're drunk.

716
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:38,360
I feel great. Bring your grandfather here.

717
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,700
I'll teach him a lesson.

718
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,440
How?

719
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,270
Grandfather...

720
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,390
Why don't you like such a good boy like him?

721
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,530
Please like him!

722
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,420
Please show him some love!

723
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,530
Hey, my grandfather is really scary.

724
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,380
If you meet him, you can't say anything.

725
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,800
Hey. Don't even worry about stuff like that.

726
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,460
Do you know what my nickname is?

727
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,720
- It's Princess, Princess. 
 - Princess!

728
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,900
The mouth of terror.

729
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,200
To be blunt, is being a chairman all that?

730
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,840
If he's the chairman, does that make it all right

731
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,720
to hate someone, marry someone off to a girl he doesn't like,

732
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,920
and force someone to sit and inherit a company he doesn't want?

733
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,740
Hey, why do you think Brother is saying no to all of that?

734
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,070
It's because of you, so he can marry you.

735
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,620
Hey.

736
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,820
Do you know why Lee Do Han is trying to marry me?

737
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,590
I don't know.

738
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,070
But do you find me cute?

739
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm the only one Lee Do Han can speak to about stuff like that.

740
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,930
I'm the only one he can be honest with!

741
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,830
But don't find me cute.

742
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,070
You can't keep liking my brother just because I'm cute. Okay?

743
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,740
Okay.

744
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,680
Mr. Driver.

745
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,020
Yes?

746
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,960
Are you sure this is the Olympic Highway?

747
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,080
Yes, it is.

748
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,930
We're going back right now.

749
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,730
Oh, no, that's not true. The IC, the IC is up ahead.

750
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,600
 You are off course. 

751
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,600
Make sure to tell the teacher.

752
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,970
Where's Sis?

753
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,910
Did Na A Jeong get a boyfriend?

754
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,750
She's been sleeping out often these days.

755
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,740
Whether she does or not, whatever.

756
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,600
Whether she comes home or not, whatever.

757
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,890
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

758
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,170
You sure Auntie isn't drinking?

759
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,740
Auntie usually sleeps over at her friend's house when she drinks.

760
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,170
Maybe?

761
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,740
Whether she drinks or not, whatever.

762
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,120
Aren't you even worried about her?

763
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:02,190
How could you treat A Jeong like you've been raising some stray cat since her childhood?

764
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,820
So why did you follow them to the hospital?

765
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,780
You knew she had no money because she got cut from work.

766
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,740
Goodness, how could you be like that?

767
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,400
I don't think so...

768
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,000
I feel like something's up with her.

769
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,980
Hello?

770
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
What is going on?

771
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,400
A Jeong, why are you here?

772
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,800
I know, right?

773
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,100
I opened my eyes, and here I am.

774
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,500
 What are you doing? 

775
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
 Say something since I don't remember. 

776
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,140
 - Do you think I remember anything? 
 - What? 

777
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,600
 If I remembered, do you think I would be like this right now? 

778
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,100
What are you doing? Eat if you're here.

779
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,170
Ahjumma, prepare some food for Do Han, too.

780
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,110
 Yes, Chairman. 

781
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,300
So, what will you do if I can't give you my permission?

782
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,300
What if I also oppose it this time, like I did to your mom and dad?

783
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,120
What will you do?

784
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,810
Will you also give up everything I've given you

785
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,820
and choose this young lady here?

786
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,100
Yes.

787
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,700
Even though she accepted the money your brother gave her without hesitation?

788
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:03,800
Also, what is it that you can't be honest about to others except for her?

789
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,100
 Do you know why Lee Do Han is trying to marry me? 

790
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,050
 I'm the only one Lee Do Han can speak to about stuff like that. 

791
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:17,650
 I'm the only one he can be honest with! 

792
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,160
Why can't you answer me?

793
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,950
I'm asking what you're hiding from me, your grandfather!

794
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,900
I'll break up with him.

795
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,310
Hey, Na A Jeong!

796
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,440
You will break up with him?

797
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,310
Yes. I will break up with him.

798
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,800
I'm not that oblivious.

799
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,300
You had me sit here while you talked about this, hoping I'd say this first.

800
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,200
Your relationship with him was this easy to give up on?

801
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,600
Being friends—

802
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,260
What?

803
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,700
You wouldn't want that, right?

804
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,040
Then, I'll do what you want.

805
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,770
So, don't waste your energy opposing us.

806
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:16,000
Just give him what you intended to give him, Sir.

807
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,200
So, Do Han doesn't give up on anything while being compared to his parents because of me.

808
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,910
Hey.

809
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,070
Hey, Na A Jeong, you said I seemed like a stranger to you, right?

810
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,780
That's how I feel right now. Who are you? Are you my friend?

811
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,600
Do you know how shocked I was when I picked up the phone this morning?

812
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,520
How did you and Ji Han end up getting drunk like that?

813
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,400
Why did you sleep at my grandfather's house, and what money?

814
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,750
I'm sorry.

815
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:59,630
I really didn't mean to, but I guess it just happened that way. I'm really sorry.

816
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,400
Is my story that easy for you to tell if things happened to go that way?

817
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,600
Do you think I may have told your grandfather?

818
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,100
I do remember that. No matter how drunk I was, I never mentioned that.

819
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,000
- I mean it. 
 - But you did.

820
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,710
You said you'd break up with me.

821
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,550
So, he should pass on the company to me.

822
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,900
I mean...

823
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,300
This is ridiculous the more I listen.

824
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,670
What should I have said in that situation, then?

825
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,600
When he started bringing up your parents, whom I know nothing about,

826
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,050
should I have grabbed your hand and run away or something?

827
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,720
You're not even interested in knowing why I lied, right?

828
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,000
It seems like you and I

829
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,330
have such a different idea of what friendship is while we were apart.

830
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,030
My idea of a good friend

831
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,360
isn't someone who takes my hand and runs off when I'm in trouble,

832
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,730
but someone who tells me I can do this to the end. That's a good friend.

833
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,650
Na A Jeong, in some situations,

834
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,200
telling someone they can do it is the cruelest thing to say.

835
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,700
Telling them you believe in them could become the heaviest burden.

836
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,090
I thought you would at least know that.

837
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,950
I guess I overestimated our friendship.

838
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,890
Hey!

839
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,870
Your face looks so bad these days.

840
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,360
Is something bothering you?

841
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,250
I've always got something going on.

842
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,500
Every day without fail since Lee Do Han came.

843
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
So, stop it now.

844
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,900
Do you know how hard it is to decide on getting married?

845
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,270
But you got married once, CEO Yoon.

846
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:47,170
Yeah. How did you end up getting married then?

847
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,720
I don't know...

848
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,210
It was such a long time ago.

849
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,000
It was just that my ideal type was

850
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,860
someone who made mundane things special for me.

851
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,790
That's me.

852
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,300
- What? 
 - We're eating mundane food like this

853
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,570
at the Han River, which is nothing out of the ordinary.

854
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,730
But isn't it really nice?

855
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,040
Yeah. It's nice.

856
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,390
As I thought.

857
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,310
My brother is a perfect match for you.

858
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,680
We're brothers. My brother also likes things like this.

859
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,980
You really try to score a goal whenever you get the chance.

860
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,160
Of course.

861
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,040
Even if I score a goal like this, I can't ever let down my guard with you and Brother.

862
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,890
I need to score an extra goal and a final nail-in-the-coffin goal to feel at ease—

863
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,980
Right, an extra goal.

864
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The nail-in-the-coffin goal.

865
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,390
CEO Yoon, you said you knew someone in the entertainment business, right?

866
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:50,270
- Yeah. 
 - Let me ask you a favor.

867
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,320
I can't believe you got the female lead's friend role. That's great, Unni!

868
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,190
I know!

869
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,310
- We felt really bad when you got cut last time. 
 - I know.

870
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:06,540
You know it's a trustworthy hit drama with the Writer Hong Bo Ra and Director Park Dae Pil!

871
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,640
But how did they end up calling you first?

872
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,100
That director saw A Jeong's acting in an indie film.

873
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:17,700
Unni, Jong Hye, I'll really try my best, thinking this is my last chance.

874
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,870
You know I got many certifications just for this moment, right?

875
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,760
If they tell me to go in the water, I will.

876
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,140
If they tell me to drop out of the sky, I can!

877
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,270
I will show them I've been ready for a long time.

878
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,880
Unni, you should reset your dream.

879
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,990
Your dream of earning a living through acting is a bit too small now.

880
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,970
- Give your father hair implants through your acting. 
  - Yeah! 

881
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,740
- Buy your mother a massage chair. 
 - That's right! 

882
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,350
- And buy coffee over there! 
  - Yeah! 

883
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,160
Thanks.

884
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,950
I make an entrance.

885
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:59,950
Seriously, what kind of an adult does she want to become?

886
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,310
- Dad. 
 - Yeah?

887
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,690
Auntie isn't an adult yet?

888
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,910
Ji Ho, just because you're older doesn't mean you become an adult.

889
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,490
She is an adult who aged incorrectly.

890
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,270
An adult who aged incorrectly...

891
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,050
Dad? You should go get your hair implants tomorrow.

892
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,000
Mom! My mom...

893
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,590
Go buy the massage chair you've wanted right away!

894
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,410
Gosh, you troublemaker! If you're drunk, go inside and stay quiet!

895
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,910
Gosh, I really need to marry her off if I want to get her out of my sight.

896
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,560
I'm not getting married, Dad.

897
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,780
I'll live in this house forever as a baby.

898
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,480
You have to support me until I'm at least 50!

899
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,420
She needs a taste of slaps before coming to her senses.

900
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,090
- Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey! 
 - No, no! Why are you doing this?

901
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,970
- Come here! 
 - Honey, Honey!

902
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:51,970
You little, come over here!

903
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,220
Why did you give birth to me if you can't take care of me until I'm 60?

904
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,090
 You're not a mother! You're not! 

905
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,810
 Be quiet! Mom, Mom. 

906
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,030
 - Gosh. Goodness. 
 - Honey, Honey. 

907
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:12,090
Director! Hello.

908
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,240
Oh, you're here, Na A Jeong?

909
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,510
Yes, I really prepared a lot for today.

910
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,630
I'll work hard so I don't disappoint you.

911
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,590
Oh, okay, sure.

912
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,310
Forget about everything else.

913
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,710
As I mentioned before, just be careful not to have

914
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,380
any personal issues that can become controversial.

915
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,360
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it to heart that you don't want your drama to cause a stir due to external factors.

916
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,510
That's enough. Go over there and get ready to shoot.

917
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,930
Yes. I'll be back after getting ready.

918
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:41,740
- Let the others know, too. 
 - Okay.

919
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,350
All right, we are going to start filming.

920
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,960
Lee Ji Han?

921
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,800
Lee Ji Han? Oh, it is you, Lee Ji Han.

922
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,380
What brings you here?

923
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:12,050
- Did you come to see me? 
 - Why would I come to see you?

924
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:15,410
This is my workplace, LJ Department Store.

925
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,220
If it's not, it's not. Why are you getting mad?

926
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,560
Then, what brings you here, Na A Jeong?

927
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,580
Me? I came to shoot a drama.

928
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,580
Where did my mirror go?

929
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,800
Lee Ji Han, how do I look?

930
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,550
How does my makeup look?

931
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,380
It's not too excessive?

932
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:48,290
I put some on because the lighting makes my face look flatter.

933
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,190
Does it look okay?

934
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,970
My lips.

935
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,230
W-What are you doing right now?

936
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:58,880
What would I be doing? I'm asking for your feedback.

937
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,710
Your heart fluttered, right?

938
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,260
- F-Flutter? 
 - Yeah.

939
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,790
- Who? Me? 
 - Yeah.

940
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,460
- With me. 
 - Who? With you?

941
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,970
You did!

942
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,060
Nice.

943
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,210
I'll go with this momentum and make everyone fall for me.

944
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:15,040
Thank you for the coffee.

945
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,440
Take care of whatever business you have to handle here.

946
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,800
Goodness, my heart didn't flutter! Hey! I seriously didn't!

947
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:25,110
Gosh, that woman...

948
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,090
Wait! What were you looking at smiling like that?

949
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,270
When did I smile?

950
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,030
Just now.

951
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,950
You were smiling like this.

952
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,400
Isn't that Na A Jeong?

953
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,740
Really? Who cares.

954
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,680
Let's get going.

955
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,840
Maybe it's because it's the first shoot. Everyone seems to be so energetic.

956
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,600
The actors are full of spirit.

957
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,850
Especially that female lead's friend.

958
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,690
She is that actress, right? The one who got in through nepotism.

959
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,870
She has no idea the director, broadcasting company, and production company suffered because of her.

960
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,810
You saw how she went around all happy, right?

961
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:36,810
I guess you need to be that shameless to overturn a finished casting and join a drama.

962
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,250
I feel sorry for the original actress who suddenly got replaced.

963
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,700
She was a rookie actress who got the role after several auditions.

964
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,580
The director really liked her.

965
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,390
I know.

966
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,800
Hello.

967
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,060
By chance, were you talking about me?

968
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,560
I got in through nepotism?

969
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,150
When?

970
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:06,500
- Ji Ho, say goodbye! 
 - Goodbye!

971
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,710
I'll talk to him.

972
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:10,800
Yes, goodbye. Let's go.

973
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:17,520
Son, did you tell the teacher you ate the kimchi when you didn't?

974
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,530
Hey, I told you lying is bad.

975
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:27,080
I told you it's way better to tell the truth and get in trouble.

976
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,600
I'm not the only one who did that.

977
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:34,060
Si Yeon and Hye Bin also didn't eat it but said they ate it.

978
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:38,340
They did the same thing yesterday, too, but nobody knew.

979
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,760
Yeah, it's possible nobody knew.

980
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,080
But at least one person knows.

981
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,860
Who?

982
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,360
Yourself.

983
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,890
Even if nobody else knows, you know what you did was wrong.

984
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,940
Na A Jeong, please stand at this tea bar.

985
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,570
Okay.

986
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,410
Just come walking out this way.

987
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,960
Okay.

988
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,500
If everyone's ready, we'll start shooting.

989
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,410
Ready, camera roll.

990
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,600
All right.

991
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,550
Ready,

992
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,120
action!

993
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,880
Cut, cut.

994
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:25,950
Na A Jeong, w-what's wrong? What is it?

995
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,250
By chance, could you tell me where Actress Na A Jeong is?

996
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,640
Na A Jeong? Who is that?

997
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,010
The role of the female lead's friend.

998
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,880
Oh, that woman? She went home earlier.

999
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,300
Pardon? Why?

1000
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:50,840
We're also curious why she apologized and left like a different person.

1001
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,600
Gosh, it's not like this is a playground for kids.

1002
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:07,650
   
 Daughter, I heard you landed a good role after passing an audition. 

1003
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,210
 I don't actually need a massage chair. 

1004
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,300
 In any case, this is such good news. 

1005
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,510
 Fighting! My daughter, you can do it! 

1006
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,670
   
 I knew you'd be successful. 

1007
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,310
 I do need my hair. Fighting! 

1008
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,890
Get in.

1009
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,090
I said, get in.

1010
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,390
Are you crazy?

1011
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:40,110
Why did you quit suddenly when you were so happy and boasting before?

1012
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,310
You said it was a good opportunity.

1013
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,580
Will you miss out like this?

1014
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,680
I heard somewhere

1015
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,930
that there exist three steps between people.

1016
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,580
Misunderstandings from not stepping close enough,

1017
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:02,560
and understanding that comes from stepping a bit closer. Exactly three steps.

1018
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:06,980
But do you know what you get when you get closer than those three steps?

1019
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,030
- What is it? 
 - What do you think?

1020
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,170
It's sticking your nose where you don't belong.

1021
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,030
Why did I suddenly quit?

1022
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,860
You dare ask me that right now?

1023
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,760
Did you just hit me? Are you crazy?

1024
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,680
Do you know why I'm so furious right now?

1025
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,510
That you got me a role through nepotism when I didn't ask for it?

1026
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:32,820
No, it's the fact that I want to call the director and beg even now.

1027
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:35,780
The fact that I still want to try my best

1028
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:40,340
pretending I don't know anything, even though I know it's wrong...

1029
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,570
That's what pisses me off the most.

1030
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,580
Do you how that feels?

1031
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,070
Gosh, I shouldn't have gone to the restroom then.

1032
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,040
No, even if I did go, if only I hadn't come out then.

1033
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,980
If I did, I could have lived in flowery dreamland

1034
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:59,580
mistakenly believing that I had finally caught my break.

1035
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,730
But who the hell are you?

1036
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:08,550
Who the hell are you to make me have nasty regrets?

1037
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,380
I got it. Let's go to the car.

1038
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,530
You can't catch a taxi here.

1039
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,750
The reason you're so screwed up

1040
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,720
is because you made me hate myself, not you.

1041
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,610
You know that?

1042
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,270
The logic of life

1043
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:53,510
is that you can't always be happy.

1044
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,070
One day, there will come a day when you will fall.

1045
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,940
Lee Ji Han, please remember my face when that day comes.

1046
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,820
That would mean my prayers were finally answered.

1047
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,940
You asked if I would miss out on a good opportunity, right?

1048
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,310
I'll seize it, then.

1049
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,380
Hey, Do Han.

1050
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:47,410
No, it's nothing big.

1051
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,300
I'll do it.

1052
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,920
Getting married.

1053
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:01,020


1054
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:06,380
♫  I fly with you  ♫

1055
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,630
♫  Azure feelings come blowing  ♫

1056
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,640
♫  What do we do?  ♫

1057
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,250
♫  A night filled with dreams  ♫

1058
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,990
♫  Only you and I  ♫

1059
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:20,390
♫  In all the days and scenes containing you  ♫

1060
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,000
♫  Butterflies are flying around  ♫

1061
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,220
♫  Butterflies are you and I, yeah  ♫

1062
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,040
   

1063
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,490
 Stand there and make your choice. Is it me or that woman? 

1064
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:34,570
 If we get married, I'll just be taken advantage of and abandoned. 

1065
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:36,590
 - It's not a child, right? 
 - Take my hand. 

1066
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,880
 Are you sure you won't regret it? 

1067
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,880
 - I'm getting married. 
 - Hey, what is she saying? 

1068
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,310
 Eloping for love. 

1069
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:42,590
 That is our concept. 

1070
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,620
 I ended up being a matchmaker. 

1071
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,600
 Who are you guys? A two-man racketeering scammer? 

1072
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,840
 Do you like Ji Han, by chance? 

1073
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,640
 I feel like you were always into Ji Han. 

1074
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,520
 No matter how much I think about it, there's only one answer to taking care of Na A Jeong. 

1075
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,940
♫  A scent that fills the air  ♫

1076
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,120
♫  Over the skyline  ♫
