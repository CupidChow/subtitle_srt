1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,850
   
   

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,870
   
   

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,350
   

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,130
   

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,710
     

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,030
   

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,070
   

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,130
   

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,810
   

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,310
   

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,470


12
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,160
 In light of certain secrets, we wish ever so desperately 

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,940
 that somebody will keep it a secret. 

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,850
 So that it'll pass by without us ever finding out. 

15
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,950
 However, ever so cruelly, the wishes don't come true 

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,410
 and we eventually face the truth. 

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,390
Why are you telling me this right now?

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,450
Why do I need to hear this from you when my brother didn't even tell it to me?

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,950
To hurt him.

20
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,950
I told Lee Do Han.

21
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,820
That I'm only going to focus on my happiness now.

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,190
 Everything crumbles from that moment on. 

23
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,830
 Acting like nothing's wrong is of no use. 

24
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,550
It looks like you failed, then.

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,650
Because I won't hurt my brother with what I just found out.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,400
It doesn't matter to me at all...

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,560
whoever Brother likes.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,920
Because Brother is my brother.

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,690
So, if you want to protect your dear happiness,

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,210
don't run your mouth elsewhere.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,030
If my brother really gets hurt because of you,

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,910
I won't stand by and watch then.

33
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,340
 Faking it without sincerity is found out in the end. 

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,400
 I also have at least one thing I want to hide from you! 

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,810
 And will it satisfy you to uncover that and make me feel pathetic? 

36
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,490
 Even if you lie to others, don't lie to me, Lee Do Han. 

37
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,090
 That means I can't trust anyone. 

38
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,280
 That would really suck. 

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,500
 I've got many things to say. 

40
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,380
 I just don't know what to say first. 

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,600
 But I can tell you one thing for sure. 

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,490
 That I'm not a good brother to you. 

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,960
 Do you know why I'm trying to marry A Jeong? 

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,110
 Because I don't want to give excuses. 

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,220
 I don't want to give excuses to anyone anymore about anything. 

46
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,790
Lee Do Han, you selfish bastard.

47
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,230
- Lee Ji Han. 
 - Come outside.

48
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,730
 But despite all that, 

49
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,400
 the reason we continue carrying out this foolish act... 

50
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,080
 is to protect somebody. 

51
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,150
 It's because we must run away from... 

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,930
 a certain truth and... 

53
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,380
 a certain sincerity, 

54
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,430
 so that person won't fall apart. 

55
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,500
What's the matter now?

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,840
 You're the one who crossed the line, not me. 

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,550
I wanted to warn you clearly.

58
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,390
Don't test me, Do Han.

59
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,050
It won't end at this level next time.

60
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,970
Next time?

61
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,090
What do you mean?

62
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,490
Hey, Jeong Dae Hyeon.

63
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,030
Where did she go?

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,450
Well, the thing is...

65
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,520
Doesn't this situation require some explanation?

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,210
Go ahead.

67
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,100
What on Earth is this ridiculous situation about,

68
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,550
so that I can try to understand you or

69
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,010
go back and explain things to Do Han?

70
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,910
I'm not letting you go back to my brother.

71
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,050
Lee Ji Han.

72
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,520
You said you can't overlook me. Right?

73
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,230
Don't go through with this marriage, then.

74
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,730
I don't think I can become in-laws with you.

75
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,420
No.

76
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,510
I'd rather not.

77
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,440
Why so suddenly?

78
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,960
You said you'd acknowledge us.

79
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,580
You told me to be happy with Do Han.

80
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,620
You can't be happy with Brother, Na A Jeong.

81
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,040
You'd be miserable.

82
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,480
So, why are you bringing that up again at this point?

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,290
Weren't you also conflicted because your decision might be wrong?

84
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,220
That night...

85
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,870
So, correct things before you get swept away further.

86
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,090
You might be late.

87
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,460
But it's not impossible.

88
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,410
   

89
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,340
Hey, Na A Jeong, what on Earthâ€”

90
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,470
What's this? Why are you two coming home together?

91
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh, I called him.

92
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,470
I asked him to pick me up at the shop.

93
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,770
- You did? 
 - I mean, I didn't realize it at first,

94
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,480
but when I actually put on the dress,

95
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,520
I got all confused because I realized I was actually getting married.

96
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,580
So, without even realizing it...

97
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,890
- I'm sorry. 
 - You could've just told me so, then.

98
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,160
Or at least take your phone with you.

99
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,610
Do you know how shocked I was?

100
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,560
Don't get mad at Na A Jeong.

101
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,310
She did nothing wrong.

102
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,020
No, it's my fault.

103
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,650
I'm sorry for making you worry over nothing.

104
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,320
But I'm feeling much better after talking to Lee Ji Han.

105
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,180
Right?

106
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,350
Get changed first, and we'll continue this conversation.

107
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,740
You should've changed if you were going to go outside. It must've been uncomfortable.

108
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,770
Not at all. You must've been so worried.

109
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,580
I'll make sure this won't ever happen again.

110
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,490
I promise.

111
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,370
Let's go inside for now.

112
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,860
 I don't think I can become in-laws with you. 

113
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,640
 No. 

114
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,800
 I'd rather not. 

115
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,390
 I'm not letting you go back to my brother. 

116
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,220
What a jerk.

117
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,580
 I think I like you enough to get pissed off if someone insulted you. 

118
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,820
 You, Na A Jeong. 

119
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,630
What am I supposed to do...

120
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,380
 Because if you end up liking me, you won't be able to marry my brother. 

121
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,990
...if I really end up liking him?

122
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm letting it go because A Jeong said so.

123
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,570
It's not like I've known her only for a year or two.

124
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,510
I doubt she'd have called you first in that situation.

125
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,080
I don't know what happened between you two,

126
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,590
but I'm letting it go because I trust A Jeong.

127
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,240
Why? Got something to say?

128
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,370
I'm tired.

129
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,410
I'll go to bed first.

130
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,100
Where are you going? That's not your room.

131
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,970
 Rest up. 

132
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,450
   
 What did you mean over the phone? 

133
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,810
 Jeong Dae Hyeon, answer me. 

134
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,350
 What the heck did you do? 

135
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,560
What are you going to do after confessing everything...

136
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,620
at this point?

137
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,570
It'll only hurt her.

138
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,190
Grandfather.

139
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,400
Grandfather.

140
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,970
What's going on early in the morning?

141
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,780
I heard you started the succession process for Do Han?

142
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,250
You handed over all your shares in the company, too.

143
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,790
There are even rumors that Do Han will appear at the next board meeting.

144
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,870
They're not rumors.

145
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,590
It's about time I started it.

146
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,740
Grandfather.

147
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,750
Go ahead.

148
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,050
I just can't understand.

149
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,920
Why do you support those two to this extent, Grandfather?

150
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,600
They're more or less the cause of Mother's death.

151
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,590
Or is there really something I don't know about Mother's accident?

152
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,040
Just think about it.

153
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,870
You never told Brother or me clearly about Mother's accident, not even once.

154
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,320
It's nothing great to be explaining things to you guys.

155
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,630
Grandfather, she was our mom!

156
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,200
Even though she had an affair and had another man's children,

157
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,780
she was still our mom, Grandfather.

158
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:00,060
Brother and I had our mother taken from us twice because of them without even knowing why!

159
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,000
We're the ones you should pity, not those two!

160
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,960
I do pity you.

161
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,920
However, do you think all of that was their fault?

162
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,950
What do you mean by that?

163
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,000
She was my daughter before she was your mom.

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,660
Don't mind unnecessary things, and just do what you need to do.

165
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,180
I understand.

166
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,580
I'll get going, Grandfather.

167
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,850
Honey, how long are you going to stay like this?

168
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,170
You need to eat to gain energy.

169
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,770
What's the use of gaining energy?

170
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,080
I don't even have the right to eat.

171
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,830
What right do you need to eat?

172
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,970
Even felons eat all three meals in prison.

173
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,690
Honey, I really came to my senses after this incident.

174
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,220
Your ambition comes before your family, and you'll get stabbed the moment you show your back!

175
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,960
Choi Seung Ah, that brat! How could she do this to me?

176
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,910
Wake up!

177
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,690
Will you quit playing forever because you lost the main role to her?

178
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,900
Do you know why people face a crisis?

179
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,620
So, we can overcome it!

180
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,170
Honey, you need to become a bigger person through this crisis.

181
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,790
The chairman of LJ, for example.

182
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,430
- Would I be able to do it? 
 - Of course!

183
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,770
Of course you can! You're Choi Min Woong.

184
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,360
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting.

185
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,590
You can do it!

186
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,980
A-Answer it.

187
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,850
What?

188
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,080
What did you say?

189
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,960
W-Why? Why?

190
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,570
Why?

191
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,640
Why, why, why?

192
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,930
I can't! I can't do it!

193
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,070
Choi Seung Ah, that brat! She said we'd do it together!

194
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,320
Yes, Reporter Kang, it's me.

195
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,850
I'll accept the offer you made last time.

196
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,540
That you'll look into Mother's accident.

197
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,540
I'm also getting curious now.

198
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,000
Reporter Kang, you need to dig into that man promptly, too.

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160
Before Lee Do Han inherits the company.

200
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,920
We don't have much time left.

201
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,830
Don't worry. I'm actually almost done.

202
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,430
I just need to confirm the person now. Yes, yes.

203
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,660
Okay. Things are getting interesting.

204
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,020
You told me to correct things before I get swept away further. Right?

205
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,080
All right. I thought about it all night.

206
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,880
I do think there's something I need to correct before it's too late.

207
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,020
You and me.

208
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,860
Wait! I think you're mistaken about something.

209
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,150
It's me? Not you and Brother?

210
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,690
Yes, you, Lee Ji Han.

211
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,450
Stop barging into my life and interfering like this.

212
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,590
I'm getting sick of it.

213
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,650
Let me confirm one thing before that.

214
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,070
I'll confirm it and decide whether I'll stop barging in or not.

215
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,810
How did you meet Brother?

216
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,910
Who confessed feelings first?

217
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,220
Did you have a hard time while dating Brother or something?

218
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,430
- Look, Lee Ji Hanâ€” 
 - Just this one thing.

219
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,810
Please answer this one properly.

220
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,990
Do you really like my brother?

221
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,840
Yes. So much so that it pains me.

222
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Others say falling in love makes them crazy happy.

223
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,470
But I'm only going crazy.

224
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,170
It's just that much.

225
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,390
So, I'm going to marry him before I get crazier.

226
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,140
That's all, right?

227
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,030
You woke up early.

228
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,640
Yeah.

229
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,150
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yeah.

230
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,850
What the heck? What's with the atmosphere first thing in the morning?

231
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,930
Did Ji Han mess up?

232
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,090
He treated you well just a few days ago, calling you "Sister-in-law." What's gotten into him now?

233
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,430
It's fine. Your brother has always been fickle.

234
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,600
Just consider him cute since we've come this far.

235
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,810
You find that cute?

236
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,110
No, I don't find him cute at all.

237
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,350
I'm just asking you to consider him that way.

238
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,890
 Mind control. 

239
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,670
 It's because that'd make you uncomfortable. 

240
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,780
Hey, since we're talking about feeling uncomfortable,

241
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,330
I think I'll have to go back home today.

242
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,080
Why? Because of Ji Han?

243
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,940
No, it's not like that.

244
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,310
I was going to go back anyway after the reporters quieted down.

245
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,210
I left home too much in a rush, too.

246
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,460
I also want to spend some time with my family before we get married.

247
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,950
 Okay. 

248
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,500
Geez! What the heck?

249
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,670
Ji Han?

250
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Why are you here like this in my empty office?

251
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,710
I was just hiding.

252
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,860
- Why? 
 - Because I can't fake it.

253
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,570
I can't pretend to be okay or pretend not to know, either.

254
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,830
Didn't you say that's what you do best?

255
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,240
Did you hear anything about my family or about the company?

256
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,730
I didn't.

257
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,560
Why? Did something happen again?

258
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,510
No.

259
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,230
I wondered if those wicked reporters were flogging us even more after what happened with Na A Jeong.

260
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,550
Please report to me everything you hear, regardless of how trivial it is.

261
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,320
Oh, okay.

262
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,000
Even I'm feeling this anxious.

263
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,770
Brother must be...

264
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,910
Would it be better if I just gave up...

265
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,670
the company?

266
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,770
No way!

267
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:32,280
What's he saying? How can our Lee Bang Won give up Joseonâ€” I mean, LJ?

268
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm sorry. I apologize.

269
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,060
That's why I said something feels off.

270
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,180
Did he mean it, or was he just saying it, huh?

271
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,780
But nothing happened when he was hating Na A Jeong.

272
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,850
Exactly.

273
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,110
But he said this with an extremely tormented face.

274
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,250
"Things wouldn't have come this far if I didn't get greedy in the first place.

275
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,830
I think I made it difficult for everyone."

276
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,850
Or could something else be the problem?

277
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,870
What's all this mess for?

278
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,270
You said you'd tidy up the room a bit, so Ji Oh can use it.

279
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,170
But you completely took out all of A Jeong's stuff.

280
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,750
Gosh, I didn't know A Jeong would come back like this.

281
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,750
Seriously, though. Why is she suddenly coming back?

282
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,720
Could she have gotten into a fight with Do Han?

283
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,550
Didn't you hear what she said?

284
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,180
She said she was coming home to spend time with her family before getting married.

285
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,670
Also, even though A Jeong's a gamecock,

286
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,110
a saint like Do Han wouldn't even fight her.

287
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,570
Yes, he's right, Mother. You're worried for no reason.

288
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,070
And even if they did actually fight, I'm sure A Jeong would've won.

289
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,690
Just like a victorious general,

290
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,050
she'd probably even bring back the spoils of war.

291
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,330
Gosh, seriously.

292
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,560
There's a lot of dust.

293
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,950
I'm here.

294
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,030
 No, I'm sure something's happened to A Jeong. 

295
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,930
 My goodness! I told you not to worry. 

296
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,320
Did you forget I had a drink with Do Han that day

297
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,920
and gave his ego a good beating?

298
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,180
Gosh, you didn't give him any beating!

299
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,810
 Three shots of soju knocked you out, and had him carry you home. 

300
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,960
 You're too weak. 

301
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,930
 Though I may be weak, A Jeong's a strong girl. 

302
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,430
 We should just trust A Jeong 

303
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,730
with whatever she does, just like we've done so far.

304
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,940
Of course, we should.

305
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,490
When did this little thing grow up so much?

306
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:49,570
You think they're a bit grown up, and they get married the next thing. Look at this.

307
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,730
 Wow, how long ago was this? 

308
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,880
Huh? Auntie!

309
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,840
Ji Oh.

310
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,460
A-Auntie?

311
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,400
Huh?

312
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,430
A Jeong.

313
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,780
I'm here.

314
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,540
A Jeong.

315
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,920
Why did you come home so suddenly?

316
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,460
Is something wrong, huh? Is that it?

317
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,300
It's nothing.

318
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,040
There's nothing wrong, so don't worry.

319
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,920
Goodness, you think I'd believe you if you said that?

320
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,420
Does it show?

321
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,700
I can't tell our family anyway, so don't try to fool me, too.

322
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,320
Just tell me. What's the real reason you came home?

323
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,900
Why is my acting so bad these days?

324
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,220
Any acting I did felt like method acting before.

325
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,600
But everything I do now feels like bad acting.

326
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,400
Why? Wait! Did your fake fiancÃ© complain?

327
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,740
Gosh, he's the one who took you, needing the bad acting.

328
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,810
No, that's not it. I just can't...

329
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,580
I just can't focus on my role.

330
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,120
Lying to Mom and Dad just now made me feel so guilty.

331
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,800
But my emotions keep flowing elsewhere amidst all that.

332
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,020
I just keep getting greedy.

333
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,400
Greedy?

334
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,080
Yes.

335
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,610
If I could, I want to forget about that main role, loyalty, and whatnot.

336
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,540
It's so rough that I want to quit it all.

337
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,540
But I can't even quit because of my greed.

338
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,880
All things aside, if the reason I want to quit is because of my greed,

339
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,570
that's just wrong.

340
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,750
That'd be really shameless of me. Right?

341
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,690
I don't know what this is about,

342
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,050
but greed is naturally shameless.

343
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,190
What's wrong with being shameless?

344
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,660
If it'll make you happy by being greedy, it's fine.

345
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,580
Tae Min and I also got married out of our greed.

346
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,070
But look at us now. Look how happy we are.

347
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,310
Why weren't you a bit more greedy?

348
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,310
Gosh, Sis, youâ€”

349
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,040
Gosh, seriously. Forget it.

350
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,670
Be greedy! So what?

351
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,910
Come on, Sis.

352
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,180
   

353
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,470
   
   

354
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,570
He said he'll contact me, but he won't even answer.

355
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,840
Even if I'm a fish in his fishtank,

356
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,270
he still needs to feed me.

357
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,580
   

358
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,590
Is your business doing well?

359
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,540
I make enough to buy you dinner, Father.

360
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,580
What about you, Chairman Yoon? Is your business doing well?

361
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,670
You brat!

362
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,030
You sure are arrogant.

363
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,480
Well, I'm not worried.

364
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
You're my daughter, but I envy you.

365
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,010
You've got everything you want.

366
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,750
I don't have everything I want.

367
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,060
I also lack something.

368
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,580
Like what?

369
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,960
There's this thing I want to have,

370
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,640
but it's really hard to have and makes me feel bummed out.

371
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,400
If there's something you want, get it by any means.

372
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,690
Don't take your time. Yes, throw your pride out the window.

373
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,530
Don't take your time. Yes, throw your pride out the window.

374
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,020
Become as lousy and pathetic as possible.

375
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,660
Do you even know what I want to have?

376
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm still your daughter, though, Dad.

377
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,220
Don't you wish I'd reserve myself and keep my dignity if I can?

378
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,560
You don't know better.

379
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,820
That's what's really awesome.

380
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,840
If you can get what you want that way, you'll ultimately be the winner.

381
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,550
 Do you really like my brother? 

382
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,710
 Yes. So much so that it pains me. 

383
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,950
Can't she just like him normally?

384
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,400
I've tried everything to stop her.

385
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,820
How can I stop her now?

386
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,630
It's not like I can tell her brother's secret.

387
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,340
Uncle!

388
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,850
Ji Oh.

389
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,670
Hey, Jo Ji Oh.

390
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,840
The teacher said you're not supposed to talk to strangers.

391
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,640
This uncle isn't a bad person.

392
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,040
He's my auntie's friend.

393
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,130
Ji Oh, great timing.

394
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,850
Is your auntie home by chance?

395
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,220
- No. She went to work. 
 - Hey!

396
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,820
Lying will get you in trouble.

397
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,540
Your auntie doesn't have a job.

398
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,900
My auntie has a job.

399
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,510
She's an actress.

400
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,110
She said she's going to play a role of filling in the holes.

401
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,200
Really? Is there such a thing?

402
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,740
Is it a repairman role?

403
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,150
By the way, why did you come to my neighborhood?

404
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,400
I just came by.

405
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,280
How old are you, Ji Oh?

406
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm seven years old.

407
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,760
Seven years old?

408
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,510
You've known her only for seven years.

409
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,980
I guess you wouldn't know her any better than my brother, who's known her for 15 years.

410
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,950
Buy some snacks for you and your friends.

411
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,200
I didn't sell you any toys today, though.

412
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,300
You sold me information.

413
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,240
Whether your auntie is home or not, and what she went out to do.

414
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,460
I can sell you stuff like that, too?

415
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,520
Uncle, I want to sell you more details, then.

416
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,230
Will you?

417
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,720
Will you really?

418
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,720
When are we going to start?

419
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,120
I don't know. It's way too hot today.

420
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,450
Why on Earth did you suddenly look for a shoot you can take right away?

421
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,870
And she got lucky on top of it.

422
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,420
It's one fill-in role, and she has such an important role.

423
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,680
Weren't you going to focus on wedding prep for a while?

424
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,880
Could there be a glitch with your happy marriage plan with your fiancÃ©?

425
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,050
That's not it.

426
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,950
I just felt a need to regain my old self.

427
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,930
And taking a break all the time wasn't so great.

428
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,270
I just got too much on my mind.

429
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,330
You must feel unsettled before your wedding.

430
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,810
- True. You went through so much. 
 - Yes, she did.

431
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:05,520
There was the family introduction, the reporters,

432
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,100
and live in someone else's house inadvertently.

433
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,220
She can't help but feel unsettled.

434
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,380
You made the right decision.

435
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,890
At times like this, coming to a familiar place is good and a good diversion.

436
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,670
You're right.

437
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,750
What you said is right.

438
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,020
I'm feeling so great right now!

439
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,610
Gosh, I'm happy.

440
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:42,270
By the way, didn't you give up on stopping the marriage between Hyungnim and Na A Jeong?

441
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,180
I couldn't sit and watch just because I tried everything.

442
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,200
Failure is the mother of all success.

443
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
If I analyze all my failures and improve them,

444
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,670
I'd eventually get the answer, wouldn't I?

445
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,870
Watch out for the equipment.

446
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,740
Keep your mind sharp and body quick on a filming location. Okay?

447
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,520
Okay!

448
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,240
- FD, at the entrance over there, 
 - Yes.

449
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,140
I think people are taking pictures.

450
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,380
- You'll have to restrain them. 
 - Yes.

451
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,620
- Thank you! 
 - Sure.

452
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,310
A person almost got injured here.

453
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,510
He's come here so often that he's basically a part of the industry now.

454
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,810
He looks just like one of the staff.

455
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,330
This is the last one.

456
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,800
- Let's hang in there. 
 - Okay.

457
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,740
Thank you.

458
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,560
Lee Ji Han.

459
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,650
What brings you here?

460
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,470
What is this?

461
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,910
Are you a modern girl now after being a monkey?

462
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,790
I'm an independence fighter.

463
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,130
Wanting to be freed from the chaotic era.

464
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,690
I thought I was finally freed from your house. What brings you here?

465
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,410
You must have an idea since you took out your gun.

466
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,680
Weren't we done talking already?

467
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,770
You said you'd stop barging into my life.

468
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,710
I've always been fickle, you know.

469
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,810
Why be surprised?

470
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,030
Shouldn't you have predicted and prepared I'd come by now?

471
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,930
You'd also know what I'll say by now, right?

472
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,640
Excuse me!

473
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,510
He's a stalker.

474
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,880
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Thank you.

475
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,800
Thank you.

476
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,600
See?

477
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,400
Failure is the mother of all success.

478
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,120
Too bad for you.

479
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,920
I expected this, so I came in with a reason.

480
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,070
â™«  Tell me, tell me your feelings  â™«

481
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,440
Unni, what's this?

482
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,570
Why is your face on here?

483
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,820
   

484
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,380
â™«  Can't wait no more  â™«

485
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,990
You gave me a money envelope, got me a role through nepotism, sent me out on a blind date,

486
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,300
and now you're trying to stop me with lunch boxes?

487
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,200
But how can this face be the same as that face?

488
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
Na A Jeong...

489
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,560
your acting is the best. The best.

490
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,770
â™«  No, I don't. Again and again, I like you  â™«

491
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,300
â™«  It won't be easy to decide  â™«

492
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,260
Where are you going?

493
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,170
Whether you're impressed or mad, show me some reaction!

494
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,160
Or I'll be embarrassed. Na A Jeong!

495
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,530
â™«  Again and again, I like you  â™«

496
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,930
I'm finally trying to settle my heart. Why did you come and disturb me again?

497
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,790
â™«  Choose what to be now  â™«

498
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
Whoa, who knew we'd see Iced Americano here?

499
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,330
I was totally shocked.

500
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,000
This is ridiculous.

501
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,790
Yes, I get it now.

502
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,310
I was just an owner who made good coffee,

503
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,220
and he had feelings for someone else.

504
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,910
Gosh, he even brought offerings. What a great display of effort!

505
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,640
You're totally miffed.

506
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,870
What's this?

507
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,320
I think you're greatly mistaken.

508
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,060
I have absolutely nothing to do with lunch box offerings for Na A Jeong.

509
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,990
So what? What does that have to do with me?

510
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,840
Move!

511
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,420
Listen.

512
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,480
You're tall for no good reason!

513
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,570
I can't even see you properly because our heights don't match!

514
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,380
How am I tall for no good reason? I'm flexible!

515
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,830
Excuse me?

516
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,010
Yes.

517
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,370
Well, I've got a question for you.

518
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,830
How much of a discount do LJ employees get on the company's cosmetics?

519
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,520
Well...

520
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,950
it's 30%â€”

521
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,880
What about discounts on hotel stays?

522
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,690
That's 20%...

523
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,650
Why are you asking me that?

524
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,870
Let me see your phone.

525
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,950
I-It's face recognition.

526
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,260
I'll contact you when I need to buy makeup or plan a trip.

527
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,360
- Sorry? 
 - So you can also

528
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,350
contact me if you want to ask me about Ji Ae. Deal?

529
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,570
O-Oh, deal.

530
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,610
- Take care. 
 - Yes.

531
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,320
Deal!

532
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,170
Deal!

533
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,070
A good person.

534
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,860
- Her? 
 - Introduce me to her.

535
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,370
I'd love to have some beer after.

536
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,560
Together?

537
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,000
What's so funny?

538
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,050
- See you later. 
 - Okay.

539
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,640
You were chatting and laughing just now, but what's this? Am I an outcast?

540
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,060
Why do you think that's not the case?

541
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,940
That's correct.

542
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,550
You even pointed a gun at a patriot like me to avoid me. What's this?

543
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,490
And what kind of an independence fighter is friends with a Japanese policeman? Are you a spy?

544
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,890
It doesn't really make sense for me to be friends with you, either.

545
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,030
- Go now. 
 - Wait!

546
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,570
That guy's weird, too.

547
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,430
I mean, you're the one who'll kill him.

548
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,600
What's this lack of professionalism?

549
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,480
Let's get immersed in the script, please!

550
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,500
I'm really sick of you.

551
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,440
Sick ofâ€”

552
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,770
Stop avoiding me, and let's have a serious talk.

553
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,530
I need to start filming.

554
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,500
If you want to talk so badly,

555
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,270
over there...

556
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,170
Go over there and send hand signals.

557
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,280
Or you can send telepathy if you'd like.

558
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,640
There won't be any replies, obviously.

559
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,360
Go now.

560
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,060
 Let's start the rehearsal! 

561
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,990
 Okay! 

562
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,300
Ready, action!

563
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,030
Whoa, why are they so brutal?

564
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,450
They were cracking up earlier, but now he's so cruel?

565
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,870
It's this way!

566
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,340
That's right. Nice.

567
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,090
Na A Jeong's flying around everywhere.

568
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,420
She's really cool.

569
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,490
   

570
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,810
- Cut, okay! 
 - Cut! That's a cut!

571
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,720
- The shoot's an okay! 
 - That was awesome.

572
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,100
 Thank you for your work. 

573
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,950
 Thank you for your work! 

574
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,650
 - Thank you for your work. 
 - Thank you for your work. 

575
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,840
 - Great work. 
 - Thank you for your work. 

576
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,710
Isn't she cool?

577
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,730
 Thank you for your work. 

578
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,910
- Bravo! 
  - All right, great work. 

579
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,020
 - Thank you for your work today. 
 - Thank you for your work. 

580
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,160
 - Thank you for your work. 
 - Hey, what's the Directing Team doing? 

581
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,070
 - Yes! 
 - Thank you for your work. 

582
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,150
 Thank you for your work. 

583
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,180
 Thank you for your work. 

584
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,190
Bring those down. Okay?

585
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,500
Your cheeks will hurt.

586
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,090
Where have you been?

587
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,400
You missed it, huh? It was amazing.

588
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,880
Ji Han, if you are going to be like this, why don't you just accept Na A Jeong?

589
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,700
I don't think you've got much of a chance at this point.

590
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,430
I won't do that even if I actually get shot with that gun. Never.

591
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,890
Why on Earth are you against them? Why?

592
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:31,610
If anything, I'd say you like Na A Jeong. You definitely don't hate her.

593
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,410
Why the heck are you opposing her?

594
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,220
Come on now.

595
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,100
Because I pity her for becoming Brother's wife.

596
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,670
Because I feel bad as Brother's brother.

597
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,420
I've got absolutely no other reason.

598
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,420
Ji Han?

599
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,590
Huh? You take off when I got to you?

600
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,020
Have a seat.

601
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,430
I won't talk about your marriage.

602
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,810
You looked awesome, your acting.

603
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,860
I don't believe you.

604
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Forget it, then.

605
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,790
But really...

606
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,670
You were really awesome.

607
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,830
Once you get married, you won't be able to freely act when you love it so much.

608
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,750
I got it.

609
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,660
Is this the only type of acting?

610
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,790
Life is all about acting the part.

611
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,540
That's right.

612
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,780
Life is acting.

613
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I'm also putting on quite the act.

614
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,570
Is it going well?

615
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,110
No.

616
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,670
It's not working so well.

617
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,640
Because I found out what I shouldn't have.

618
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,750
You're in a similar situation as me.

619
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,750
It's the same for me.

620
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,670
I'm trying to act like nothing is wrong,

621
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,880
but it's not going well.

622
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,270
You know, false acting that lacks sincerity

623
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,210
is bound to crumble in the end.

624
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,420
What else can we do, though?

625
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,560
We need to see it to the end.

626
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,340
But should we take a break for now if it's too tiring?

627
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,810
Since we're on a break.

628
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,380
Shall we?

629
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,240
Since we're on a break,

630
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,770
it'd be okay to take a short break. Right?

631
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,930
Just for a moment.

632
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,570
 The person you are calling is not available... 

633
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,050
What the heck are you thinking, Jeong Dae Hyeon?

634
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,470
Yes, Secretary Kim.

635
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,100
 Do Han, the chairman would like to see you right now. 

636
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,000
Right now?

637
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,600
Well, what did you need to tell me?

638
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,110
Yes.

639
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,600
It's about time you partook in company management.

640
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,070
In my opinion,

641
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:43,610
let's have you show up at the board meeting that's coming up as a start.

642
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,570
I don't think I can do that.

643
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,730
- Why? 
 - There is still a bit of noise about A Jeong

644
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,370
and rumors about being an illegitimate child.

645
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,570
I told you this last time.

646
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,070
You can't resolve anything by running away like that.

647
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,260
You can't protect yourself or your people by running away.

648
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,410
Grandfather...

649
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,440
Noise? If that's the problem, all the more reason now is the best time.

650
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,910
Who knows what else will trouble you later if it's already like that?

651
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,310
It'll be hard to remedy later on and

652
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,100
even harder to find your position.

653
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,600
If something is troubling me now,

654
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,000
wouldn't it trouble me in that position?

655
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,270
It's not that it won't. It can't.

656
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,050
Why?

657
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:34,940
Because that seat is so high up that no one can even reach it.

658
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,660
Do Han, do you know why you're so afraid and have so much trouble around you?

659
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,700
It's because you don't have any power.

660
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,500
Do you want to protect your people?

661
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,710
You have to first protect yourself. You.

662
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,250
We're here.

663
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,110
I knew it. You pretended to sleep because you didn't want to talk to me.

664
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,470
Whoa, that was a nice nap.

665
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,790
You were so chatty during the break.

666
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,670
That break is over.

667
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,320
You'd say the same thing over and over anyway.

668
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,790
You knew that, and you asked me to take you to Brother?

669
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,720
And do you have to come over today?

670
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,880
Aren't you even tired?

671
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,570
Did I ask to meet him?

672
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,620
Lee Do Han asked me.

673
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,220
Did I ask you to come? You came by.

674
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,030
Complain to your brother and yourself, not me.

675
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,360
Na A Jeong.

676
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,900
Ji Han.

677
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,600
CEO Yoon?

678
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,060
What brings you here?

679
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,210
I came to see you.

680
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,250
I couldn't reach you, and you seemed busy.

681
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,490
But I guess you weren't busy with work?

682
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,120
Since you're coming with A Jeong.

683
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,850
- Oh. 
 - Oh.

684
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,070
We bumped into each other nearby.

685
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,240
Oh, is that so?

686
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,490
Yes. I'll go inside first because I need to see Do Han.

687
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,040
Let's get together with Do Han next time. The four of us.

688
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,760
The four of us just might become family.

689
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,050
Family?

690
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,090
Family?

691
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,610
I don't think we're family yetâ€”

692
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,510
We're not yet.

693
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,980
In fact, I'm clinging to Ji Han.

694
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,970
Why? It's true!

695
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,670
I've been acting all cool about it, but I don't think I should do that.

696
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,700
I like Ji Han so much that I've become jealous of all kinds of things.

697
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,100
I'm even bothered by the relationship between you two.

698
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,200
Funny, right?

699
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,200
I'm not talking about some other woman, but a sister-in-law and a brother-in-law.

700
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,340
Gosh, I'll have to make him mine quickly.

701
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,600
I plan to do my best from now on.

702
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,400
I'll be honest without calculating, so I won't regret it later.

703
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,400
- Why? 
 - Don't force a smile.

704
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,540
You said you'd be honest.

705
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,250
But you should still forgive my smiles.

706
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,790
I look prettier with a smile.

707
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,860
I wasn't just saying those things earlier.

708
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,060
That I'm bothered by you and Na A Jeong.

709
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,720
You two are weird.

710
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,320
You don't look like just in-laws. You never did.

711
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:48,500
I wasn't going to say this because it'd make me sound pathetic.

712
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,080
But I can't overlook it anymore.

713
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,910
Tell me honestly.

714
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,480
Is there something between you two?

715
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,040
It's not like that.

716
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,740
CEO Yoon, you're drunk.

717
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,710
Let's get up now.

718
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,550
You're belittling me as well by doing this.

719
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,770
If you can't fool me perfectly, why don't you just be honest?

720
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,400
Having done so makes me feel pretty pathetic.

721
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,200
But I think it's better than being cowardly.

722
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,850
I'll get going first.

723
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,100
 I plan to do my best from now on. 

724
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:03,280
 I'll be honest without calculating, so I won't regret it later. 

725
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,480
I envy her.

726
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,430
Who?

727
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,090
Huh?

728
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,200
Yoon Chae Won seems like a great person.

729
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,900
Oh, you said you met her outside. Right?

730
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,700
What do you find so great and envious about her when you're the great Na A Jeong?

731
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,730
I envy her about everything, and she seems terrific.

732
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,390
But her honesty?

733
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,350
And that she has the right to be.

734
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,480
That's what I envy the most.

735
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,930
Is something wrong?

736
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,740
You go first.

737
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,980
Me?

738
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,100
Is something wrong?

739
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,780
Yeah.

740
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,760
The person I used to see before...

741
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,620
The one you ran into last time.

742
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,270
He contacted me recently.

743
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,220
What did he say?

744
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,460
Not sure.

745
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,800
It does seem like he told someone my secret,

746
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,450
but I'm not certain.

747
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,550
But Grandfather suddenly wanted to see me today.

748
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,760
Grandfather found out?

749
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,280
No, he just told me to inherit the company.

750
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,300
He said I can protect myself if I inherit the company, find my place,

751
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,590
and become stronger.

752
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:29,210
I'm sure there won't be anyone attacking me then.

753
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,710
And I won't be exposed, either.

754
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,950
But is that really protecting me?

755
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,540
Isn't it just locking me up?

756
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,250
I just don't know. That's what I thought all this time.

757
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,970
But it also makes me think it's no big deal.

758
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:50,710
To be honest, I was a bit scared after he contacted me this time.

759
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,530
Because I might cause trouble for people around me.

760
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:01,350
But still, I'm sincerely glad I have you.

761
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,650
Because you're always on my side.

762
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,530
Oh, anyhow, is something wrong?

763
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,510
No.

764
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,770
Nothing's wrong with me.

765
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,620
What the heck?

766
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,630
All right.

767
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,190
Let's just be honest about everything.

768
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,400
You're home.

769
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,870
Yes.

770
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,570
Where's Na A Jeong?

771
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,510
She left.

772
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,750
I see.

773
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,100
I have something I want to discuss with you.

774
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,060
- About A Jeong? 
 - Huh?

775
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,170
Let's not talk about that anymore.

776
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,240
I know you don't like A Jeong once again.

777
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,300
Considering the happening at the dress shop, too.

778
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,150
But I don't ever want to go back on this decision.

779
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,400
I like A Jeong and

780
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,660
I'm going to marry A Jeong.

781
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,060
How much do you like her?

782
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,640
- What? 
 - She says she likes you so much that it pains her.

783
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,110
How much do you like her, Brother?

784
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,550
Do you even like her?

785
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,460
Gosh, I guess we really are brothers.

786
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,050
Since I'm a coward when it comes to fighting.

787
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,800
- Lee Ji Han. 
 - Brother.

788
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,620
Let's stop being cowards.

789
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,600
Let Na A Jeong go.

790
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,790
Don't marry Na A Jeong.

791
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,200
Enough is enough, please!

792
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,000
I've got tons of things to worry about besides you, Ji Han. Okay?

793
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,100
Just be straight with me if you've got a reason or something.

794
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,690
I can't stand you acting as you please.

795
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,700
Even to the end...

796
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,200
You selfish bastard.

797
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,900
What did you say?

798
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,390
You think you're the most unfortunate person in the world, huh?

799
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,450
You're only full of self-pity.

800
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,940
It's ugly.

801
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,990
Aren't you embarrassed...

802
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,790
to live like that?

803
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,540
Asshole.

804
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,030
You're the one who's acting as you please, not me.

805
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,640
What?

806
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,620
You do it every single time.

807
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,700
When you're about to get married,

808
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,720
when you were leaving five years ago, and when Mother passed away, too.

809
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,690
Did you ever tell me properly, even once?

810
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,170
Did you ever tell me what you were choosing and how you would live?

811
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,550
- That'sâ€” 
 - Nonetheless!

812
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,220
I pretended not to know and endured every time.

813
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,160
"I see."

814
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,850
"I must've not been trustworthy."

815
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:58,380
"I must've not been credible." I was actually sorry.

816
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,470
Because it's a minefield everywhere, as you said.

817
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,160
Grandfather,

818
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,080
Choi Min Woong, Choi Seung Ah, and others whispering in the back. They're all minefields.

819
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,970
But I'm the one who brought that on me!

820
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,610
Because I caused my parents' death.

821
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,440
All right.

822
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,970
Let's say you can do that to me.

823
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,550
Let's say you can keep quiet, hide, and fool me as you please.

824
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,090
But what about other people?

825
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,260
What did Na A Jeong do to deserve that?

826
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:46,570
Please stop thinking about how you'll be hurt and...

827
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,050
think about how others would get hurt.

828
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,990
You know everything.

829
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,270
I must've gone mad for real.

830
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,580
I've got Do Han, but Lee Ji Han keeps...

831
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,880
   

832
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,930
What is it?

833
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,120
 Can you come out for a second? 

834
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,050
 I'm near your house right now. 

835
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:35,580
 This will be the last time. 

836
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,800
What is this?

837
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,060
What's with the face?

838
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,990
Don't you know my face has always been amazing?

839
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,190
Seriously, what happened?

840
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,080
Who did this to you?

841
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,880
If I tell you,

842
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,550
will you hit him for me?

843
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,280
You don't need to hit him for me.

844
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,130
Just don't marry him.

845
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,870
Did you fight with Do Han?

846
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,860
Why did you fight?

847
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,950
I told him not to marry you.

848
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,310
You deserve to get hit.

849
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,560
Your mouth should've taken a hit instead of your face.

850
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,680
By the way,

851
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,360
why are you doing this?

852
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,440
Why are you going this far?

853
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,000
Because I like you, Na A Jeong.

854
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,130
I like you so much that it pains me.

855
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,420
I can't keep up the act anymore.

856
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,540
No, I'll give up.

857
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,520
I don't think I can do this anymore.

858
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,300
I told you I'd make you fall for me.

859
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,930
But I think I'm the one...

860
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,990
who fell for you.

861
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,870
That's why I'm objecting to this marriage.

862
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:41,110
- Stop joking around. 
 - I'm not joking.

863
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:44,090
I'm not lying or giving an excuse.

864
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,270
In fact, I think there is...

865
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,220
only one real reason.

866
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,610
Crazy.

867
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,410
Crazy bastard.

868
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,210
Hey!

869
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,480
This is really ridiculous.

870
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,690
Are you in your right mind?

871
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:30,920
Are you insane?

872
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,650
You're not even human, are you?

873
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,680
You're not even a person, are you?

874
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,670
I'm your sister-in-law-to-be.

875
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,650
But how can you do this?

876
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:42,930
Even if you felt that way, you should've kept it to yourself to the end.

877
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,770
You should've held it in!

878
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:50,360
You always obsessed over your brother, but you were lying, huh?

879
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,010
How can you do this to Do Han?

880
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,530
Answer me.

881
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,250
Answer me.

882
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,430
Answer me!

883
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,950
Do I look easy to you?

884
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,950
You think I'm easy, huh?

885
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,780
You're doing this because you think I'm easy, huh?

886
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,330
You keep doing this because I'm easy!

887
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,900
Go on and say something!

888
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,020
Answer me!

889
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,670
It's not like that.

890
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,430
I'm sorry.

891
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:45,430
Who do you... Who do you think you're to keep doing this?

892
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:49,280
Because you keep doing this, I get sucked into it, too.

893
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,450
I tried so hard to hold back this whole time.

894
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,570
I tried ever so hard!

895
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:05,020


896
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,030
I think I've lost it because of you.

897
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:39,570
â™«  A sky filled with clouds, we fly high, get away  â™«

898
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,850
â™«  In your arms, way high, left away  â™«

899
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:50,610
â™«  As if spring came, the cozy sunlight shines on you  â™«

900
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:56,040
â™«  To you, oh yeah  â™«

901
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:02,830
â™«  The wind raises its hands and embraces my cheeks  â™«

902
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:08,110
â™«  Shining like it's burning, all the perfect timing  â™«

903
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:11,900
â™«  A scent that fills the air  â™«

904
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:17,060
â™«  Over the skyline, dive down past it  â™«

905
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:22,560
â™«  I fly with you, azure feelings come blowing  â™«

906
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:28,300
â™«  What do we do? A night filled with dreams  â™«

907
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:35,420
â™«  Only you and I, in all the days and scenes containing you  â™«

908
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,210
   

909
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,140
 Just trust me and follow me from now on. 

910
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,600
 Lee Ji Han, when did you start liking me? 

911
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,540
 What do you think would've happened if you met me before Brother? 

912
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:51,250
 Do you honestly think you and Na A Jeong can be together? 

913
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,980
 Would Na A Jeong be okay with that? 

914
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:58,150
 Tell me everything honestly from now on, too. 

915
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,850
 - What's this?  
  - This is your brother. 

916
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,530
 Let's meet. 

917
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,250
 No way. 

918
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,800
 Let's be honest. 

919
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,470
 When and where did things start going wrong? 

920
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:12,140
â™«  All the perfect timing  â™«

921
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,380
â™«  A scent that fills the air  â™«
