1
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,060
Believe in God's mercy

2
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:04,398
and confess your sins honestly.

3
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,319
Father.

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,989
I must be possessed by Satan.

5
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,033
Pardon?

6
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,787
What's happening to me
can't be explained otherwise.

7
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,123
My stomach's lurching several times a day

8
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,708
and my head's throbbing.

9
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,628
I've never had insomnia before,

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,172
but I suddenly can't sleep.

11
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,969
Why don't you tell me
what's been tormenting you so much?

12
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,139
My heart's pounding

13
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,559
toward someone it shouldn't.

14
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,270
Regardless of my will,

15
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,106
I keep watching someone I shouldn't,

16
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,567
and even when I know it's wrong,

17
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,779
my feet keep moving toward her.

18
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,413
I'm not sure

19
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,500
why I keep caring about her.

20
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,628
And how I ended up

21
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,339
having feelings for her.

22
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,758
I thought you hated rain.

23
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,679
Ji-han?

24
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,265
This is surely a problem.

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,561
There's no way that I'd
voluntarily enter that sinful path!

26
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:25,855
Father.

27
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,898
Can we

28
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,901
do it right now?

29
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,736
Do what?

30
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,906
-An exorcism.
-Exorcism?

31
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,116
Yes.

32
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,579
Whatever you feel,

33
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,248
it's not a sin.

34
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,709
Even if it's not, I don't want it.

35
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,045
Avoiding and ignoring your feelings

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,758
will only bring more confusion.

37
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,760
Then what am I supposed to do?

38
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,387
You should

39
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,265
look into your heart properly

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,601
and

41
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,186
choose

42
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,689
the right path.

43
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,857
Don't worry.

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,941
Then,

45
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,570
let us pray for you together.

46
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,158
Dear Lord,

47
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,453
a lost lamb

48
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:27,082
desperately seeks your wisdom today.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,169
Even in times of hardship...

50
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,338
Make her disappear from my heart.

51
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,467
Take her away.

52
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,136
Please, I beg you.

53
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,639
Please!

54
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,392
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

55
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,960
Ji-han.

56
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,920
Ji-han.

57
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,234
What?

58
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,444
We can use it together.

59
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,713
Jeez. He's so stubborn.

60
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,590
He never listens to me.

61
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,095
He got drenched.

62
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,057
I wonder if he's okay.

63
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,569
LEE JI-HAN

64
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,488
No.

65
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,784
Who cares if he caught a cold?
It has nothing to do with me.

66
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,495
I didn't tell him to get rained on.

67
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,539
He threw the umbrella.

68
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,958
-Honey.
-Yes?

69
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,335
-How long does it take to Jeonju?
-Jeonju?

70
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,756
A few hours, maybe? Why?

71
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,299
Well,

72
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:45,554
we should've just gone there if we knew
the bibimbap would take so long.

73
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,390
What do you mean?

74
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,267
What?

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,395
Oh, gosh.

76
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,773
Who's she talking to?

77
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,692
She's an amazing actress.

78
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,528
It's not easy
to get absorbed at home. Right?

79
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,446
Right.

80
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:07,034
I guess it's fortunate
that she decided to act, right?

81
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,328
Right.

82
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,872
-She found her path.
-Right.

83
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,124
But my bibimbap got lost.

84
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,755
Honey, let's be patient.

85
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,882
She'll be gone soon anyway.

86
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,759
Right?

87
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,763
She's crazy.

88
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,689
Right.

89
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,401
It's not too late.
I just have to take the right path.

90
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,618
NA A-JUNG

91
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,705
Are you testing me, God?

92
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,292
There's no use showing me the wrong path.

93
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,670
I've made up my mind.

94
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,966
Where are you going?

95
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,011
That's not the way. It's this way.

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,813
I know.

97
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,816
He obviously didn't.

98
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,744
A hundred and seven...

99
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,882
A hundred and eight...

100
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,891
I'll lose my knees
trying to get rid of A-jung.

101
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,312
I've done enough.
I'm sure either God or Buddha

102
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,272
will get rid of her for me.

103
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,613
What?

104
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,531
What's this?

105
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,204
What the...

106
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,958
There's no use praying.

107
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,295
I can see her everywhere in videos.

108
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,142
"How do get over

109
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,311
your crush."

110
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,442
It's simple. Just ask them out.

111
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,654
If you get rejected,
you will get over them.

112
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,657
They're saying it as if it's so easy.

113
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,243
I'm doing this
so I won't embarrass myself.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,580
Fold 1,000 paper cranes
and wish to forget them.

115
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,582
It's classic, but it works.

116
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,126
Are you kidding?

117
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,755
How can I fold 1,000?
I'll grow old and die before I'm done.

118
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,508
Deoksugung stone wall road
is a mecca for breakups.

119
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,093
Walk there and break up

120
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,844
with your crush by yourself.

121
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,888
Everything's superstition.

122
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,357
What are you doing?

123
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,186
Are you sleeping?

124
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,232
If you have nothing to say, go.

125
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,278
I have a lot to say.

126
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,281
I just don't know what to say first.

127
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,951
I want to ask if you're okay,

128
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,121
but I'm not sure if I should ask

129
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,917
about you catching a cold
or how you feel after being in the rain.

130
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,087
And I want to apologize,

131
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,300
but I don't know where to start.

132
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,096
Not taking care of you,
or saying I'd cut ties...

133
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,768
But I know one thing.

134
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,188
I'm not a good brother to you.

135
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,319
Just give it time.

136
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,280
I'm sure Grandpa will

137
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,783
acknowledge you soon.

138
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,285
And

139
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,747
you'll accept A-jung soon too.

140
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,420
I sent your clothes to the dry cleaner's.
And I brought tea, so drink it.

141
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,714
I'm going out.

142
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:27,938
I must be crazy.

143
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,899
How will I face Do-han now?

144
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,456
EPISODE 6

145
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,376
Are you all right?

146
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,046
What a surprise.

147
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,132
You worrying about me?

148
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,427
Thanks, but there's no need.

149
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,220
I tried not to,

150
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,557
but seeing you makes me worried.

151
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,353
-That's it?
-I realized again

152
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,148
that I can never take your place.

153
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,361
That position seems to come
with things I can't handle or understand.

154
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,613
Right.

155
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,532
Then just take it.

156
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,952
You'll understand everything over time.

157
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,205
I don't get why that reporter
is still bothering us.

158
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,000
Or why you're still involved.

159
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,545
It seemed like it would only get worse.

160
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,797
I don't want to get involved.

161
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:41,011
No, you're just scared that you'll be
the victim of that reporter.

162
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,849
If you're scared, don't run away.

163
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,185
Sit in that seat and gain power.

164
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,896
That's how you protect
yourself and your people.

165
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,191
I'll get going.

166
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,111
We should pull your wedding forward.

167
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,531
-What?
-I talked to Mr. Kim.

168
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:06,703
So set a date for a meeting
with A-jung's family.

169
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
Wait.

170
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,582
Why so suddenly?

171
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,417
It's already started.

172
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,630
That reporter's begun
digging around you and A-jung.

173
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:19,883
What?

174
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,345
Isn't this why you asked
Mr. Kim to prepare a press release

175
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,222
about A-jung?

176
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,977
PROFILE
YANG JI-AE

177
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,231
What's the point of working so hard?

178
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,150
I'm doing this again
because no one's calling me.

179
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,820
And I can't write stuff like
"Palace lady 1" or "Colleague 3."

180
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,740
How do I know if I'm number 1, 2, or 3?

181
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,409
My mom told me to quit acting next year

182
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,203
if I continue on like this.

183
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,081
She'll get me a studio
so I can continue pottery.

184
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,042
Right, you were popular
in your ceramics department.

185
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,630
So I broke my savings account
to shoot a new profile.

186
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,966
I won't need money if it doesn't work out.

187
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,302
Wow. How immature and reckless.

188
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,139
Once you get older like us,
it'll all get boring.

189
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,307
So enjoy it now.

190
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,102
Yes, enjoy it now.

191
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,938
You're having fun too.

192
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,940
You're getting ready to marry,

193
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,526
and you're seeing someone.

194
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,736
You're seeing a guy?

195
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,448
It's nonsense. I'm not seeing anyone.

196
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,169
DO-HAN

197
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,631
Hey, Do-han.

198
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,552
Right now?

199
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,763
Okay. I'll head to your studio.

200
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,515
Sure.

201
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,185
I thought you were doing well
after abandoning me,

202
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,397
but your voice sounds like you're not.

203
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,191
Don't say that. I never abandoned you.

204
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,652
I helped you go with Do-han.

205
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,405
I told you, I'm on your side.

206
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:06,823
That means

207
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,494
I want to be by your side,
at least when you're having a hard time.

208
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,914
I'm actually regretting it.
I should've gone with you then.

209
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,669
Why work out at this hour?

210
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,920
There's the saying,

211
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,965
"a healthy mind in a healthy body."

212
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,386
I haven't been
taking care of myself lately.

213
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,598
That's random. Are you ill?

214
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,475
I almost was,

215
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,102
but I discovered it early.

216
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,689
What? Really? What is it?
It's not serious, is it?

217
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,774
It's kind of

218
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,235
like an infection
from a small amount of bacteria.

219
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,365
Don't worry, I'll get better soon.

220
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,659
I'm doing my best

221
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,577
to cure myself.

222
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,420
There's a guest for you.

223
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,261
What's that face? I'm hurt.

224
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,056
We almost became family once.

225
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,977
But we didn't.
We're not close enough for sudden visits.

226
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,063
And you're

227
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,359
close enough to visit my mom
with Grandpa on her death anniversary?

228
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:35,995
I hear you're helping with the shopping
mall because you like my younger brother.

229
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,123
But I have two.

230
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,460
Which one is it?
I need to know to get rid of him.

231
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,171
Seung-a.

232
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:50,510
I always thought you were
smart and meticulous.

233
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,347
Thanks for the compliment,
but we have no time to waste.

234
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,391
But I guess I was wrong.

235
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,476
You got caught.

236
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,397
I know you're the one
who sent that reporter.

237
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,442
I must've been mistaken about you.

238
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,112
If I knew there was no need
to be polite to each other,

239
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,906
I should've come to you and told you

240
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,408
that I knew everything.

241
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,830
And I'm telling you
instead of telling the chairman

242
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,459
because this is the last warning
I can give you.

243
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,921
A warning not to hurt
your brother anymore.

244
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,256
Who do you mean?

245
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,634
Is it Do-han or Ji-han?

246
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,094
Both of them.

247
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,599
Whoever it is, it'll hurt Ji-han.

248
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,063
So it's Ji-han.

249
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,488
I see.

250
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,739
She's leaving now.

251
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,331
Aren't you busy?
Was I mistaken about that too?

252
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,082
Come to think of it,

253
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,919
I haven't repaid you for this.

254
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:10,757
You told me honestly
that you found out about me.

255
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,218
So I'll be honest too.

256
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,721
Since I know how you feel,

257
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,390
I'd feel too guilty to hide it.

258
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,311
I'll send you a text,

259
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,063
so check it.

260
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,236
So rude, not even
getting up from her seat.

261
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,332
LJ DEPARTMENT STORE CHOI SEUNG-A
SENT 8 IMAGES

262
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,441
What?

263
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,694
Hey, door!

264
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,737
It's me.

265
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,906
Why are you being shy?

266
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,868
When did he change it?

267
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,370
Is it a fingerprint lock?

268
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,999
He must've changed his lock.

269
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,127
Right.

270
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,587
He must've changed it.

271
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,593
Just in case you're suspicious,

272
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,553
I'm not a thief or anything.

273
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,972
I'm a friend of this place's owner.

274
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,557
-But--
-It's you, right?

275
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,018
The one Do-han's marrying.

276
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,730
Oh, do you know him?

277
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,732
I was curious about you.

278
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,071
It was nice meeting you.
See you next time.

279
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,578
What was that?

280
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,372
So does he know Do-han or what?

281
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,542
He looked really shady.

282
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,141
Sorry I'm late.

283
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,685
I guess you're no longer desperate.

284
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,356
How could you
make the lead actress wait out here?

285
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,982
Sorry.

286
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,320
What's that look?

287
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,697
I know that face.

288
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,409
You make it
just before asking a big favor.

289
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,787
What is it?

290
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,747
Is something wrong?

291
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,084
What? A meeting with my family?

292
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,005
Grandpa already set up a team
for our marriage.

293
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,341
He wants to set a date right away.

294
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,719
I'm already stressed thinking about it.

295
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,514
Do we really have to do that?

296
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,599
Sorry.

297
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,894
But it might be best
to get it over with quickly.

298
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,939
You saw what happens
when reporters start digging.

299
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,275
There will be
gossip and scandals in no time.

300
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,527
It seems like

301
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,488
I keep getting additional scenes.

302
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,949
Sorry about that too.

303
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,159
Let's do it next week.

304
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,411
Really? You sure?

305
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,163
Of course. We have to do it anyway.

306
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,710
Even if it's fake, it's still a marriage.
I thought of it too easily.

307
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,922
I should've planned everything
and made preparations beforehand.

308
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,883
Did you just realize that? It's too late.

309
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,678
But I'll do better now.

310
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,514
I'll get the best for you.

311
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,518
All right. I'm finally getting treated
like a lead actress.

312
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,521
Let's do this, then.

313
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,939
Let's do this.

314
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,207
-Thanks for today.
-Yeah.

315
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,795
I should've become a writer.
I didn't know I was so good.

316
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,966
-Get inside.
-Bye.

317
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,301
Oh, right. Do-han.

318
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,679
We didn't discuss
the most important issue.

319
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,764
What?

320
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,309
What's your brother up to these days?

321
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,435
Ji-han?

322
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,270
I mean, he really hates me.

323
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,773
He'll throw a fit if he finds out
about this.

324
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,067
I'll talk to him again.

325
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,985
No, I'll talk to him.

326
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,447
I need him to like me to solve this.

327
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,740
Right, but...

328
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,325
Will you be okay?

329
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,702
Why are you worried?

330
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,413
I always solved everything for you.

331
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,334
Let's just resolve this the simplest way.

332
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,086
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

333
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,921
Tell me how it goes.

334
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,215
-And call me if anything happens.
-Okay.

335
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,053
You want some, Ji-oh?

336
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,221
Here you go.

337
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,764
Thank you.

338
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,058
You too.

339
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,645
We're meeting Do-han's family.

340
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,522
What's that solemn tone?

341
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,107
Of course we are.

342
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,483
A family meeting

343
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,570
is the first step to getting married.

344
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,239
Next week.

345
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,952
A-jung.

346
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,706
You should've told us beforehand!

347
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,043
You can't just set a date
without any warning.

348
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,464
It just happened. There's nothing
to prepare. You just have to show up.

349
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,718
Still, we should buy
some clothes and shoes.

350
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,637
-Shoes?
-I only had one pair

351
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,056
of formal shoes, but you threw it away.

352
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,767
I should get a decent handmade pair.

353
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,727
You're right.

354
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,941
Then I should get some skin care
and go on a diet too. I gained weight.

355
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,277
You're not the one getting married.

356
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,196
Skin care? Diet? There's no need.

357
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,281
A-jung.

358
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:12,493
The meeting is like
a battle between the families.

359
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,746
If you don't look decent at the meeting,

360
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,082
you already lose from the beginning.

361
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,878
Yes, they might look down on you.

362
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,715
The way we dress and look at the meeting

363
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,468
will decide whether or not
you get looked down on by his family

364
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:30,970
after you get married!

365
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,598
Just show your usual selves.

366
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,185
Overdoing it would just make us
look more tacky.

367
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,519
She's right.

368
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,438
-By the way...
-Yes?

369
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,899
Will I meet that guy at the meeting?

370
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,775
Who?

371
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,112
The guy who bought my mat at our house.

372
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,740
-The guy who bought your mat?
-Yes.

373
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,500
Are you feeling okay?
You got drenched that day.

374
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,594
Doesn't he have fingers?

375
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,931
Is it so hard to send one reply?

376
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,146
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

377
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,654
-Here.
-Thanks.

378
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,738
I'll do that

379
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:31,822
Here.

380
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,408
-The file you mentioned.
-Oh, yes.

381
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,035
Here's the material.

382
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,119
-Thank you.
-Sure.

383
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,874
It seems like you're doing
all the work these days, Mr. Lee.

384
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,585
Right. We saw that you skipped lunch

385
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,296
and even emptied the trashcans.

386
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,381
It's fine.

387
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,883
I want to be of help to LJ.

388
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:55,012
You really seem
to care a lot about this company.

389
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,306
It's really professional.

390
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,849
Professional?

391
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,519
He's just being foolish.

392
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,855
The higher-ups won't notice
your hard work.

393
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,149
I bet they don't even know our names.

394
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,819
I sent you that sales summary
you mentioned

395
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,070
through email.

396
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,530
Check it.

397
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,079
Tell me what it is now.

398
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,375
What's going on?

399
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,044
What do you mean?

400
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,507
So much is going on
that I don't know which one you mean.

401
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,135
Don't play dumb.

402
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,304
I've known you for a long time.

403
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,139
Something happened

404
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,558
that day at the memorial hall, right?

405
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,688
I'm right.

406
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,649
What on earth happened there?

407
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,319
Why are you doing this to me?

408
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:52,820
I didn't do anything.

409
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,323
You really don't know?

410
00:26:56,574 --> 00:27:00,870
You're bullying me every day
under the pretense of being productive.

411
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,664
Breathe in.

412
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,791
And exhale.

413
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,588
Raise your bottom and do the child's pose.

414
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,259
You call me to a yoga center every morning

415
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:18,220
and torture me,
going on about miracle mornings.

416
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,640
LANGUAGE INSTITUTE

417
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,809
Can you read aloud?

418
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,567
There are some roads you shouldn't cross.

419
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,735
I don't like her.

420
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,237
There are some roads you shouldn't cross.

421
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:36,947
I don't like her.

422
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,202
And you make me
attend a language school after work,

423
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,454
going on about self-improvement.

424
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,208
-That's not all.
-What are you doing? Let's go.

425
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,292
Hey.

426
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,754
-Hello.
-You even follow me around

427
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,049
on the weekends
when I'm enjoying my hobbies!

428
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,513
Do you see these bags under my eyes?
I can't do this any longer.

429
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,392
Leave me out of your productive
life project or whatever it is!

430
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,564
Oh, my.

431
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,858
Mom, there's nothing to eat at home.

432
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,319
What's that?

433
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,530
We got this for A-jung's first birthday.

434
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,908
We didn't give this during the IMF

435
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,286
or sell it when your dad had
a hard time with his shop.

436
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,249
To give it to A-jung when she marries.
The day's finally coming.

437
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,959
That's so unfair.

438
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,461
You didn't give me anything.

439
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,754
Why only A-jung?

440
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,132
-I knew it. Don't you remember?
-What?

441
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,176
You used up everything
for your trip to Europe.

442
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,679
-Anyway, Mom,
-Yes?

443
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,765
will our in-laws let us
live in this house?

444
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,394
You think they'll make us
sell it for the dowry?

445
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,189
No, I mean, they're a conglomerate family.

446
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:55,443
They could buy us a house as a gift

447
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,570
or set up a big shop for us.

448
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,029
You know.

449
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,532
Don't say that to A-jung, even as a joke.

450
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,118
We're not selling her to them.

451
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,162
You marrying Tae-min

452
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:10,374
and A-jung marrying Do-han
are the same to me.

453
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,793
Still, we should seem decent

454
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,045
so we don't have people whispering.

455
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:19,550
I mean, do you even have anything to wear
for the family meeting?

456
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,343
-I do.
-What?

457
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,053
The one I bought recently.

458
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:26,265
Come on, Mom.
That's what'll make her feel small.

459
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,600
I told you.

460
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,479
What we wear
and how we behave at the meeting

461
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,230
will decide whether or not

462
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,941
A-jung gets looked down on by our in-laws.

463
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,278
I...

464
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,989
I didn't think that far.

465
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,700
A family meeting?

466
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,120
I guess you really are
getting married now.

467
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,330
I know, right?

468
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,624
I guess I really am.

469
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:56,629
By the way, where will the wedding be?
LJ Hotel? Many rich families do it abroad.

470
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,465
I'm not sure. I wish I could just

471
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,384
register the marriage
and skip the wedding.

472
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:08,307
But if we have to do it, I'd like to
have a simple wedding in a buckwheat field

473
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,392
-with noodles...
-Are you crazy?

474
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,436
Don't be ridiculous.

475
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,898
The most important part of a wedding

476
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,566
is the food.

477
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,028
There will be important guests
at the wedding,

478
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,447
and you'd give them noodles?

479
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,074
Get a grip!

480
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,702
I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it
if this gets too big.

481
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,455
Handle what? Just don't divorce him.

482
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,629
And there's a guy I can't handle.

483
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,386
You know,

484
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,222
the guy who came saying he was your fan.

485
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,849
-Welcome.
-Hi.

486
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,526
That's the guy I told you about.

487
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,782
I heard you're a fan.

488
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,327
Oh, right. I said that.

489
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,669
And you come here often.

490
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,046
Yes, I work right nearby.

491
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,971
You mean LJ.

492
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,059
I get what's going on.

493
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,313
Where's Ji-han?

494
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,399
We have new textbooks. Pass them around.

495
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,991
What's this?

496
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,348
Skipping class is the best
when you don't want to study.

497
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,269
-One.
-Top charts.

498
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,395
One, one.

499
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,988
Memories of you

500
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,200
Our past love

501
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,162
Becomes a thorn

502
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,207
Digging into me

503
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,543
Even if I beg it to leave

504
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,056
Canceled.

505
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,268
Why did she have to take

506
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,436
so many jobs?

507
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,865
Excuse me. Can you take a photo of us?

508
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:12,950
-Sure.
-Okay.

509
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,576
-Thank you.
-Sure.

510
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,749
All right, then.

511
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,251
One, two, three.

512
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,629
-One more.
-Smile.

513
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,424
One, two.

514
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:30,843
What?

515
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,358
What? Did he just treat me like a ghost?

516
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:54,992
Sorry about that.

517
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,452
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

518
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,024
That ghost has chased me into my home.

519
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:29,985
And even says hi.

520
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,116
You're early.
You came home late these days.

521
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,875
Oh, we're preparing
for our family meeting.

522
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,834
What?

523
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,559
Damn it.

524
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,188
What was that?

525
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,898
Is he mad at me?

526
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,317
-He didn't say anything.
-No,

527
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,986
I know him. He's mad at me.

528
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,780
I know him better than you.

529
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,993
He's quiet.

530
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,203
Let's keep going.

531
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:23,914
Well...

532
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,792
Oh, right. They suggested

533
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,711
we do it at Grandpa's house.
What do you think?

534
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,715
A-jung.

535
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,929
-Hey.
-Right.

536
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,597
So we'll have it...

537
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,143
I think we're done.

538
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:47,938
Do you want something to eat?

539
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,775
Okay, I'll go check.

540
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,778
I wonder if Ji-han ate.

541
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,071
I'll go and ask him.

542
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,047
Did you have dinner?

543
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,009
If you didn't, join us.

544
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,093
No thanks.

545
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,232
You saw me earlier at the park, right?

546
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,821
Why are you ignoring me
as if you can't see me?

547
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,492
And why did you ignore my texts?

548
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,754
Are you angry
about us having a family meeting?

549
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:58,967
I won't mess it up
like I did last time at your Grandpa's.

550
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,011
So

551
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,013
don't worry.

552
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,185
Why would I worry about you?

553
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,355
-What?
-You don't need to worry either.

554
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,231
I'm not attending it.

555
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,775
If you're done, leave.

556
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,321
I don't want to talk to you at home too.

557
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,431
What about Ji-han?

558
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,642
He says he won't eat.

559
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,021
And that he's not attending
the family meeting.

560
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,189
What?

561
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,399
He's not coming.

562
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,776
Let me talk to him.

563
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,444
It's fine.

564
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,532
It's better than having to worry about him
messing it up.

565
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,368
This is for the best.

566
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:09,871
Honey.

567
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,207
I feel uneasy somehow.

568
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,127
Is it right to support Do-han's marriage?

569
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,963
I don't know. I feel uneasy too.

570
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:22,884
Grandfather had good wedding dates picked
and made a guest list himself.

571
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,430
I feel like we're losing against them.

572
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:30,308
You should've asked for something
when we married.

573
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,145
You idiot, why didn't you get anything?

574
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,231
I gave you everything.

575
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,775
So I can't do anything without you.

576
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,195
So what?

577
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,448
You want some back?

578
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,993
Will that be enough?

579
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:51,246
Even if you give it all back, it won't be.

580
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,002
You called us here.
Why are you picking a fight?

581
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,588
So what?

582
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,506
What's your plan, then?

583
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,969
Should we worry about Do-han,
who Grandfather supports?

584
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:09,264
Or Ji-han, who Yoon Chae-won supports?

585
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,101
My head hurts.
Why is everything so complicated?

586
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,480
Does your head hurt
whenever something bothers you?

587
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,566
What's that tone?

588
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,234
You're being really rude.

589
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,153
No need to worry about them.

590
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,113
We can get rid of both.

591
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,323
Is that so easy?

592
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,866
-You have a plan?
-Yes.

593
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,911
You said your head hurts.

594
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,373
Why don't you think about it yourselves?

595
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,792
Good luck.

596
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,567
She must be sensitive before the wedding.

597
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,277
-Right?
-No.

598
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:09,366
She was talking to that last time.
I'm sure there's a story behind it.

599
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,920
Do you get paid more if you work so hard?

600
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,463
Chae-won.

601
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,923
What's the occasion?

602
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,258
Let's go.

603
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,263
This is what you meant
by relieving stress?

604
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,391
I thought you'd take me
on a ride on the highway.

605
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,851
We have that too.

606
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:36,977
Over there.

607
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:41,690
And what's wrong with this?
This is a safe way to relieve stress.

608
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,610
When I was in high school,
you took me to an arcade and said,

609
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:50,073
"You have to relieve stress right away.
But in a safe way."

610
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,703
"It's legal to shoot fire
at your opponent here, so enjoy it."

611
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,705
I was cute back then too.

612
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,587
Darn it.

613
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,340
One more game.

614
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,437
I kind of

615
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,689
feel better getting hit.

616
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,650
Right,

617
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,028
I deserve it.

618
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,614
What? Did you just curse me?

619
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,115
Yes, I did.

620
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,993
So keep hitting me.

621
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,536
All right.

622
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,751
How's your headache?
Are you feeling better now?

623
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,295
I'm not sure if it got better or worse.

624
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,257
-You never go easy on me.
-I already did.

625
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,346
I didn't even come to cheer you up today.

626
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,934
I feel like I'm the one who lost.

627
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,436
-What?
-It's nothing.

628
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,109
Thanks for today.

629
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,906
That thing I told you...

630
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,243
About a bacterial infection.

631
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,704
I thought it'd heal quickly,

632
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,707
but it kept festering.

633
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,171
I laughed a lot thanks to you.

634
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,465
Like the old days.

635
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,425
That's good.

636
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,180
Speaking of which,

637
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,933
you had a crush on me back then, right?

638
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,603
-Your first love?
-Why suddenly ask that?

639
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,313
So I wasn't?

640
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:46,731
I mean...

641
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,775
I was just a kid.

642
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,278
How dare I like you?

643
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,697
Are the sparks still there?

644
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:55,699
What?

645
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,369
Can I make those feelings come back?

646
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,912
Can I try?

647
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,754
I keep having things I want to ask you,

648
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:15,093
but I'm not sure if it's okay to worry
or to ask you.

649
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,305
I keep censoring myself. It's not like me.

650
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,393
So I want to get that point clear.

651
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,646
Ji-han.

652
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:31,318
I'm helping with the shopping mall
because of you, not Do-han.

653
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,153
What?

654
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,946
You still don't get it?

655
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,073
I like you, Ji-han.

656
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:40,869
What...

657
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,497
You what?

658
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,834
Think about it.

659
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,670
I won't wait long.

660
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:03,767
What's wrong?

661
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,727
You love mango shaved ice.

662
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:11,358
I just don't have an appetite.
I'm too cold.

663
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,442
Too cold?

664
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,361
Have you lost it?

665
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,571
I keep getting the chills

666
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:20,241
ever since I met Ms. Na.

667
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,620
I can't believe I betrayed Mr. Lee.

668
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:29,125
I guess this is how it'd feel
to spill a secret after torture.

669
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,629
Were you tortured by Ms. Na?

670
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,588
What torture?

671
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,466
Eye torture.

672
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:37,550
What?

673
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:41,096
She stared at me like this.
With those huge eyes.

674
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:45,850
Then I'm always being tortured.
The chairman's eyes are bigger.

675
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,064
She wouldn't tell him, would she?

676
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:56,653
If he finds out he got betrayed by me,
he'll kill me.

677
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,240
No.

678
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,283
From his current state,

679
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,994
he won't even have the strength.

680
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,128
You're home late.
You seem busy these days.

681
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:14,712
Yes.

682
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,714
I have a lot of work.

683
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:20,844
You're really not coming?

684
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,848
Let's talk later.

685
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,474
I'm too tired now.

686
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,583
Let's see what happened.

687
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,604
Who's this?

688
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,065
Wow!

689
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,026
This is a house?

690
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,611
Yes, it is.

691
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,363
It's just someone's house.

692
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,033
No need to feel small. Hold your heads up.

693
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,662
This way.

694
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,424
Come on.

695
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:47,639
-Hello.
-Hello.

696
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,307
-Welcome.
-Hello.

697
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,477
-I'm Hyun Dae-ho, Do-han's grandfather.
-Hello.

698
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,396
-You brought your kid.
-Hello.

699
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,523
Hi.

700
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:58,107
Thank you for coming.

701
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,567
I know it must've been

702
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:04,489
uncomfortable coming to my house
when it's our first time meeting.

703
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,241
It's all right.

704
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,494
It's cool to see the kind of house
we only saw on TV.

705
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,374
All right, then.

706
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,919
We can talk slowly over dinner.

707
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,254
This way, please.

708
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,838
-This way.
-Right.

709
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,394
-All right.
-Here.

710
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,895
-Have a drink.
-Sure.

711
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,438
It's nice to meet you.

712
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:39,941
And thank you for deciding

713
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:44,195
to let your precious daughter
marry my grandson.

714
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:45,989
No, don't say that.

715
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,491
She still has a lot to learn.

716
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:50,368
-Take good care of her.
-Of course.

717
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,287
Here.

718
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:58,126
Once the conversation begins,
this will be our first crisis.

719
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,461
-Money?
-Yes.

720
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:04,007
If it doesn't go well,
a conflict would start from there.

721
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:08,344
I think my mom and dad
will do okay regarding that.

722
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:12,098
What shall we do about
the wedding gifts and dowry?

723
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,729
Well, you don't need to worry about that.

724
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,066
Why don't we omit such formalities?

725
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:26,279
Still, shouldn't we prepare something?

726
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,281
-The adults are talking.
-What?

727
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,533
It won't even make a difference.

728
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,827
There's no point doing such stuff.

729
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,913
-But the problem is Su-jung.
-What?

730
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,583
She never backs down from a fight.

731
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,210
What did you just say?

732
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:42,712
What?

733
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,881
I didn't say anything.

734
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,802
-Enjoy.
-Sure.

735
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,598
We decided to skip the gifts and dowry.

736
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:56,309
And we already got wedding rings.

737
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,393
Well done.

738
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,395
Why didn't you tell us?

739
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,402
By the way, what do you do for a living?

740
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,154
I write novels.

741
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,489
Wow, which books?

742
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,991
I haven't published anything yet.

743
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,788
Then anyone who golfs is a golfer,

744
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,748
and our housekeeper's a chef.

745
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,291
What's with you?

746
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,043
Min-woong's a problem too.

747
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:26,631
I'm sure he'll mock someone
who seems like an easy target.

748
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,715
Really?

749
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,093
It'll be my brother-in-law.

750
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,428
What do we do?

751
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,972
-Does he get hurt easily?
-No.

752
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,057
I meant we should

753
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,351
worry about Min-woong.

754
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,270
He may not look that way,

755
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,814
but he's actually crazy.

756
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,692
I want to ask, when will you

757
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,319
stop causing trouble?

758
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,321
Trouble?

759
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,200
I've actually bought some
of your company's stocks.

760
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,203
But I almost lost everything a few times.

761
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,039
Whenever the price started going up,

762
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:02,417
various scandals broke out.

763
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,585
-Drunk driving too.
-That was her.

764
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:05,837
Sorry.

765
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,296
-Anyway--
-It wasn't me.

766
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,632
There were big scandals like that.

767
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:10,800
So I just

768
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,345
want to know when you'll stop causing
trouble like that.

769
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,975
If you could tell me when,
it would really help my stock trading.

770
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,143
-Sure.
-Thank you.

771
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,353
Go on. Eat. You look hungry.

772
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:23,896
-Eat up.
-Right.

773
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,025
Oh, Ms. Seo.

774
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,404
And once we announce the marriage,

775
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,449
we'll send out a press release
we've prepared.

776
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,494
We'll keep A-jung's identity hidden,

777
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,997
so there's no need to worry.

778
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,582
What?

779
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,168
Why would you hide her identity?

780
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,756
-A-jung...
-It would be troublesome

781
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,175
if we reveal everything about her.

782
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:55,470
There may be some inconveniences
for both our families,

783
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,680
and it might affect our stocks.

784
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,807
She's right.

785
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,019
We shouldn't harm
your economic activities.

786
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,979
-Right.
-Right.

787
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:05,980
Enough.

788
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,820
We're the ones who are lacking,

789
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,364
not our daughter.

790
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,826
Ma'am, we didn't mean that.

791
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,077
Then why would you

792
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,163
-hide her identity?
-Mom.

793
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,916
There's nothing wrong with her.

794
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,918
-Ms. Seo.
-We want to protect her.

795
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,003
Ji-han.

796
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:35,593
Once it's announced,

797
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,887
the media will harass her.

798
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,475
But A-jung won't get hurt,

799
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:44,936
because she told me

800
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,940
that she doesn't care what strangers say.

801
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:52,652
But it seemed

802
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,281
like she couldn't see
those around her get hurt.

803
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:02,286
So you don't need to worry.

804
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,166
It doesn't matter what others think.

805
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,878
You know who she really is.

806
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,216
Even if we don't know,

807
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,011
she knows herself

808
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,682
that she's a good person.

809
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,811
Right.

810
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,646
He's right, ma'am.

811
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:34,110
We'll treat your daughter
just as preciously as you did.

812
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:38,030
I apologize if it made you uncomfortable.

813
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,702
Eat up, everyone.

814
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:55,882
-Do-han.
-Yes?

815
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,300
-Get the car.
-Okay.

816
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,384
-Oh, no.
-It's fine.

817
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,261
We already called a car.

818
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,179
-Let's meet again.
-Yes.

819
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,266
-Thank you.
-Of course.

820
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,350
Bye.

821
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:07,727
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

822
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,811
Let's go.

823
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,820
-Watch the stairs.
-Come here, Ji-oh.

824
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,447
Let's go, Ji-oh.

825
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,656
-Mom.
-What?

826
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,200
I thought he was just bullying her,

827
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,744
-but he was nice.
-A-jung.

828
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,078
You're right.

829
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,164
About the press release...

830
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,790
It's okay.

831
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,044
No need to explain.
And I heard everything earlier.

832
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:37,131
A-jung!

833
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,549
We should get going.

834
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:39,759
Go on without me.

835
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,261
I have something to do.

836
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,471
-Okay, then.
-Bye.

837
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:47,391
-You're going, right?
-Yes.

838
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:48,726
-Good job.
-You too.

839
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,999
You answer my calls now.

840
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,627
Let's meet.

841
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,652
You know

842
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,697
I can't contain my curiosity.

843
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,995
Why did you come to the meeting?

844
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,289
Isn't it weird not to?

845
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:34,999
I'm Do-han's family.

846
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,169
Right.

847
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,006
It'd be weird,

848
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,885
but you said you wouldn't come.

849
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,970
Did you come to complain about that?

850
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,306
No, that's not it, but...

851
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,727
But I thought I should

852
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,855
say this to you face to face.

853
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,361
I was bothered
when you said you wouldn't come,

854
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:09,241
and I was happy you came
and grateful you took my side.

855
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,035
It's fine.

856
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,622
I didn't do it to hear that from you.

857
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,248
But in the end,

858
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,250
you made me say that.

859
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,713
I've thought about it,

860
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,343
and I think you can hurt me now.

861
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:33,974
Aren't we involved
in each other's lives now?

862
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,454
Why did you say you wouldn't come

863
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,832
if you were going to?

864
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,335
I didn't want to see you.

865
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,715
Why the change of heart, then?

866
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,096
I thought I should still see you.

867
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,851
Since it's over, just be honest.

868
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,895
You came to ruin it, didn't you?

869
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,608
I thought you were just shameless,
but you're clueless too.

870
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,528
Didn't you know? I lack a lot of stuff.

871
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,865
I have no money, no conscience,

872
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,700
and no patience.

873
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,326
So answer my question.

874
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,704
What made you change your mind?

875
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,750
I think I can see

876
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,088
the right path for me now.

877
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,011
Attending the meeting

878
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,806
meant I'd accept it.

879
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,360
Accept what?

880
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,613
You and Do-han.

881
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,294
I hope you live happily

882
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,547
with my brother.

883
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,137
EPILOGUE

884
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:41,912
Let's be happy.

885
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,372
It's nothing special.

886
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,499
My brother and A-jung

887
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,251
are nesting in my house.

888
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,921
The person I'm marrying
coincidentally meets someone I know?

889
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,631
Don't you dare touch A-jung.

890
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,551
"Marriage contract"?

891
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,928
-Are you crazy?
-What's wrong?

892
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,640
I should do this much
for my sister-in-law.

893
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:04,184
Why do you keep calling me sister-in-law?

894
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,519
Brother-in-law?

895
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,355
Let's keep our places as in-laws.

896
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:12,693
Are you really okay with me
marrying Do-han?

897
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,075
