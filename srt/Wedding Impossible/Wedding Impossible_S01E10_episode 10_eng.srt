1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,750
   
   

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,780
   
   

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,330
   

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,240
   

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,800
     

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,100
   

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,100
   

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,350
   

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,810
   

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,200
   

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,490
   

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,450
 It's here. 

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,130
 Here's your tangsuyuk. 

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,940
 Kaoliang liquor. 

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,350
   

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,980
   

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,450
 Oh, yes. One moment. 

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,970


19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,870
 It's hot! 

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,000
 I told you we should've had Sprite. 

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,620
 Sprite doesn't look cool. 

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,930
 I always wanted to try something like this. 

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,960
 Drinking after breaking up. 

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,980
 It was only fake dating, so what breakup? 

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,440
 Fake? 

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,070
 Hey! That fake one was my first relationship, so go along with it. Okay? 

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,380
 I told you we should've pretended to have broken up early on. 

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,880
 What, pretend? 

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,010
 Hey! Who said to break up after sitting together on the bus for our second-year school trip? 

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,040
 That was me, but you said we couldn't break up 

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,810
 in the second semester of the second year because you needed to copy my homework. 

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,590
 You're right. 

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,980
 Why didn't I know then? 

34
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,780
 It may be easy to get close to your best friend by pretending to date him, 

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,990
 but it's tough to become distant by pretending to break up. 

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,230
 So, do you regret it? 

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,610
 How you stood up for me in front of the kids two years ago? 

38
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,060
 Well, you know. What if you really fell in love with someone else? 

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,010
 I don't regret it at all. 

40
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,110
 It's friendship over love for me any day. 

41
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,060
 Are you sure you just haven't found a person to love over your friends? 

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,170
 Is that the case? 

43
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,280
 I just mean you're more important right now. 

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,010
 You can be moved all you want. 

45
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,350
 You seem just like a younger sibling. 

46
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,450
 You brat, you call your noona your younger sister? 

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,330
 No, I meant my real younger sibling. My biological sibling. 

48
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,350
 He also said the same thing today. 

49
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,920
 He asked why I didn't tell him about my graduation when he wanted to come. 

50
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,270
 He said I matter the most to him. 

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,360
 I barely stopped him from missing the Olympiad he prepared for months. 

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,270
 Whoa, how thoughtful. 

53
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,810
 You're really blessed with people. 

54
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,950
 You've got two bodyguards who protect you. 

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,300
 You're right. I'm thankful to everyone for protecting me. 

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,270
 That's when I vowed. 

57
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,620
 That I'll also protect my only friend, A Jeong, and my only family, Ji Han, 

58
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,020
 in any moment in life. 

59
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,680
 That vow was broken today, and I looked back too late. 

60
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,770
 When and where did things start going wrong? 

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,820
Since when was it?

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,040
Is it after Ji Han found out I like men?

63
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,770
What did Lee Ji Han find out?

64
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,620
So, you two started when he didn't even know...

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,860
our marriage was fake?

66
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,920
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,410
What were you just talking about?

68
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,580
Your marriage is fake?

69
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,080
Lee Ji Han.

70
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,530
 Perhaps it was impossible to keep that vow in the first place. 

71
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,180
 To protect someone means... 

72
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,230
 you'll not run away and fight back. 

73
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,570
 But I've always resorted to running away all my life. 

74
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,600
Lee Ji Han.

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,090
Lee Ji Han!

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,420
- We need to talk more— 
 - What should we talk about?

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,130
Do we even have something to talk about or...

78
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,560
- I mean... 
 - Do you have something more to tell me?

79
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,960
To summarize,

80
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,010
you knew Brother was gay from the beginning, and

81
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,640
your marriage was a fake one to hide his secret.

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,680
And you hid that from me to the end, Na A Jeong.

83
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,030
I think we're done clarifying things.

84
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,790
Is there anything I didn't comprehend here?

85
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,540
Lee Ji Han, I also...

86
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,020
- I also had my reasons— 
 - You should've told me sooner if you were going to.

87
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,620
Just when were you going to tell me?

88
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,090
How much of a pathetic fool did you want to turn me into?

89
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,830
When we promised to stop hiding our feelings and putting up an act at the beach,

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,220
was that all a lie?

91
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,010
- That's not it— 
 - When did you tell Brother?

92
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,370
The day I begged you to trust me and wait?

93
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,940
It would've been better if that was the case.

94
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,960
We're not done talking here.

95
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,900
I was also fooled by the two of you.

96
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,500
It was actually worse for me.

97
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,420
I don't think you should be acting like this right now.

98
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,740
Choi Seung Ah came to me.

99
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,780
She doesn't know my secret yet.

100
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,820
But it's only a matter of time before she finds out.

101
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,370
Because Reporter Kang had gone to Jeong Dae Hyeon as well.

102
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,770
So, you two can't do this. Things will get worse if you two date.

103
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,780
I'm barely holding myself back from running away as is.

104
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,150
I really don't know...

105
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,570
what I should even do in this situation.

106
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700
- Lee Ji Han. 
 - Don't go.

107
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,040
Our marriage is still on. Nothing changed.

108
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,250
Do Han.

109
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,290
If you sincerely think of me as a friend, you can...

110
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,790
You can reconsider your decision at least once.

111
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,960
You need to.

112
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Am I wrong?

113
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,120
   

114
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,540
 Everyone come down for breakfast! 

115
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,600
 Yes! 

116
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,000
A Jeong! You almost made me faint first thing in the morning.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,180
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,470
Huh? What's this?

119
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,840
A Jeong? Are you doing method acting?

120
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,380
I said to come for breakfast!

121
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,010
Yes.

122
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,500
How many times do I have to set the table?

123
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,870
- I'm sorry. 
 - Later.

124
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,770
Any later, it'll be lunch and dinner, not breakfast.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,320
A Jeong, what's the matter with you these days?

126
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,960
Why aren't you eating any food?

127
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,780
Huh? Son-in-law.

128
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,500
Why is Son-in-law here?

129
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,420
You should at least eat before you go. The table's all set up.

130
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,700
No, it's okay, Mother. I came without notice.

131
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,310
Please invite me for a meal next time.

132
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,540
Okay, then.

133
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,380
Are you two coming home late today?

134
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh, yes. There are a lot of things to prepare.

135
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,320
We need to look into a home, appliances, furniture, this and that.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
That's true.

137
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,480
I'm sorry I've been too busy with the wedding coming up and couldn't give you attention.

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,940
Gosh, not at all.

139
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,100
- I'll be back. 
 - Okay.

140
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,710
What's gotten into her?

141
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,810
I don't know what's wrong with her,

142
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,420
but she doesn't really eat and can't really get much sleep.

143
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,970
I'll make sure A Jeong feels better today.

144
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,930
My gosh! Okay, then.

145
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,560
- I'll get going. 
 - Yes, yes.

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
Yes.

147
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,500
- Please take care. 
 - Yes, have fun!

148
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,020
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,280
Huh? For what?

150
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,560
I couldn't really tell you properly yesterday—

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,120
Oh, right. About our starter home.

152
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,860
It'd be better to get one in this neighborhood, right?

153
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,420
It'll be close to your family, too.

154
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,430
- Do Han. 
 - And about signing the marriage papers—

155
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,370
Lee Do Han!

156
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm also trying my best. Can't you see?

157
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,380
I can see it.

158
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,570
That's why it hurts even more.

159
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,330
I'm really sorry.

161
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,270
I tried not to come this far.

162
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,710
I was going to hold myself back somehow, but I failed.

163
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,380
I think I like Lee Ji Han too much to do that.

164
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,630
Do Han.

165
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,730
I know I sound really insane

166
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,740
and I know it's shameless of me to say this

167
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,950
but can't you give me some slack just this once?

168
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,320
If you continue to come off like this, I can't help it, either.

169
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,590
Let's go to New York.

170
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,540
- What? 
 - Forget the wedding and everything.

171
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,100
We'll go to New York right away as we first planned.

172
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,230
H-How could you—

173
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,080
How could you do this to me?

174
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,740
Don't you know how I felt when I asked you to fake our marriage?

175
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,000
I was really desperate, A Jeong.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,430
I wanted to hide my secret and create any breathing room I could, but—

177
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,900
It's not like getting found out will only put me in trouble.

178
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,640
Are you okay with your parents finding out, huh?

179
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,830
Isn't that why you couldn't say anything earlier, either?

180
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,370
I'm going this far to ask—

181
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,970
Never mind, Do Han.

182
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,020
It's natural for you to be like this.

183
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,170
I'll make it up to you...

184
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,540
for how I've wronged you somehow.

185
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,320
But I can't do this anymore, either.

186
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,660
   
   

187
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:12,980
   

188
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,900
 I'm in front of your office. 

189
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Why won't you pick up your phone?

190
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,970
Why are you avoiding me?

191
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,400
You came all this way to ask me this right now?

192
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,870
- Because it's too urgent for me. 
 - It was too soon.

193
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,380
- Because it's too urgent for me. 
 - It was too soon.

194
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,860
I needed more time.

195
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,140
I can't look at your face the way I did before.

196
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,770
A-Are you saying you'll cut ties with me like this or something?

197
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,680
Lee Ji Han!

198
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,620
I...

199
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,460
I can't trust you anymore, Na A Jeong.

200
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,590
You knew how I decided to go to you.

201
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,410
You knew everything I gave up to go to you.

202
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,220
I chose you over my brother, whom I thought was my everything in life, but...

203
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,900
But you didn't feel quite the same.

204
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,000
At first, it was Brother. And later, it was you, Na A Jeong.

205
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,140
Do you know how I feel whenever it happens?

206
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,290
As much as I risked my everything,

207
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,440
it felt like my entire being was rejected.

208
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,470
It's scary.

209
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,600
I don't know what secret I'll find out now and how I'll be hurt again.

210
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,530
Lee Ji Han, are you okay with us just—

211
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,060
I'll have to get back now.

212
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,930
How can he do that?

213
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,080
How can he?

214
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,390
I told you to leave for the day.

215
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,200
Come on, how can I go anywhere without you, Ji Ae?

216
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,780
But why are you so pretty?

217
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,540
Still, you must be tired from work.

218
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,780
What if it affects you tomorrow at work?

219
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,460
Ji Ae, you're my top priority over everything.

220
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,350
Gosh, you're so cool!

221
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,210
You're so cool!

222
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,810
How can half of a conversation be made up of "gosh"?

223
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,390
By the way, Unni, is something wrong?

224
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,140
You're not saying anything after seeing that.

225
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,490
- Jong Hee. 
 - Yes?

226
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,220
Do you want to go grab a drink today?

227
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,860
I don't think I feel too good today—

228
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,100
Yes. Hello?

229
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,330
 This is Yoon Chae Won. 

230
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,910
O-Oh, yes. Hello.

231
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,900
You really came.

232
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,080
Well, yes.

233
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,700
I heard from Ji Han.

234
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,440
He said he likes you, A Jeong.

235
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,620
I hate becoming a part of a trashy drama like this,

236
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,710
so I was going to forget about Ji Han.

237
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,490
But it didn't really work.

238
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,380
That's why I came. To clarify things.

239
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,670
Do you feel the same way as Ji Han, A Jeong?

240
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,690
Yes.

241
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,000
Stopping you won't work?

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,740
Yes.

243
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,480
You didn't even hesitate once, ever so shamelessly.

244
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,570
I guess that's why things ended up this way.

245
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,740
It's because I cherish Lee Ji Han that much.

246
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,440
What about Do Han?

247
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,630
Didn't you used to cherish Do Han at one point, too?

248
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,610
Do Han... I still cherish him.

249
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,930
I'm going to do anything to protect him.

250
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,800
What?

251
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm really sorry, but I'm not in the best mood today. So, I'll take a shot first.

252
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,590
What's this?

253
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,620
So, you've lost contact with Ji Han right now?

254
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,750
No, no.

255
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,750
I keep hitting him up, but Lee Ji Han won't.

256
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,570
But it's not a big deal.

257
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,070
He's just a bit offish, I guess?

258
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just that he's a bit cold to me.

259
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,860
Wait, I shouldn't have come here. I should've gone to Ji Han, huh?

260
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,300
Why would you go there?

261
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,510
I need to go for the opening.

262
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,910
I said there's no opening of any kind.

263
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,630
We're like this for a brief moment temporarily.

264
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,180
You don't believe me, huh?

265
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,430
Even if Lee Ji Han lets go of me,

266
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm not going to let go of Lee Ji Han.

267
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,620
Because I'm going to stick by his side.

268
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,360
Even if you'll lose everything else?

269
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,480
I mean, it's true.

270
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,900
It's easy for me. I only need to lose my pride.

271
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,440
But you'll lose everything if you date Ji Han.

272
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Even still?

273
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,080
Even still.

274
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,880
What does it mean to lose everything?

275
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,920
I don't really know.

276
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,600
But I think it'll still feel better than losing Lee Ji Han at the end of the day.

277
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,710
It's already bad enough that I want to die.

278
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,640
So, I think losing everything else would

279
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,630
at least let me breathe.

280
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,180
Gosh, that was so cheesy that it sobered me up.

281
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,860
   

282
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,900
Me, too.

283
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,860
You can take one for yourself.

284
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,190
Don't expect we'll become friends while sharing stuff like this.

285
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm a hard person to befriend.

286
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,490
I'm really sorry.

287
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,390
But I don't really want to become your friend, either. Okay?

288
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,380
I heard you're Lee Ji Han's first crush.

289
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,670
That bothers me a bit, as well.

290
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,300
And for us to become friends?

291
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,610
That's complete nonsense.

292
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,590
Forget it and just drink.

293
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,720
It tastes good and

294
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,220
the alcohol's great, too.

295
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,820
My mood's the only thing that sucks.

296
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,540
I didn't expect you to come to me first.

297
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,760
We need to put things in order.

298
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,710
Did you meet A Jeong today?

299
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,620
What if I did?

300
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,440
Will you continue to meet her?

301
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,250
I think I was ashamed of you for the first time in my life.

302
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,770
Of course, it's not because you're gay.

303
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,870
It's because you used someone to hide that fact.

304
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,750
I told you many times that A Jeong had agreed to it beforehand.

305
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,170
You shouldn't have dragged her into this, to begin with

306
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,090
if you really care about Na A Jeong.

307
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,060
Let me say it again.

308
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,830
I'm not giving up this marriage.

309
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,900
- Do it. 
 - I can't.

310
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,530
Do it even if you can't.

311
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,670
You don't need to open up about the marriage being fake.

312
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,640
You can just break it up and make it as good as void, Brother.

313
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,920
I'll keep your secret.

314
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,230
What about you, then?

315
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,910
Is it for A Jeong's benefit to continue your relationship with her when she'll be criticized?

316
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,400
Na A Jeong said she doesn't want to.

317
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,970
How long will you use her as your tool?

318
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,310
Choi Seung Ah found out about everything.

319
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm already nervous that the scandal may break out any day now.

320
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,270
That scandal will never break out.

321
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,780
What the heck are you thinking?

322
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,310
I won't tell you to inherit the company anymore.

323
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,810
So, let go of Na A Jeong.

324
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,410
Let's just live our own lives.

325
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,610
I'm done talking, so I'll get going now.

326
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,040
   

327
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,570
I thought we agreed to talk later.

328
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,760
 I can't make the paper crane. 

329
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,220
- What did you say? 
  - I can't make the paper crane. 

330
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,670
 The paper crane... 

331
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,090
Na A Jeong, are you drunk by chance?

332
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,080
 I didn't drink. 

333
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,250
 I flushed them down! Yeah! 

334
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,320
Where are you right now?

335
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,510
 The call is not going through. 

336
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,310
Why did you come all the way here...

337
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,070
What's the use of asking?

338
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,790
What the heck is this?

339
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
A paper crane.

340
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,140
I was going to pray for a wish, too.

341
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,090
But it was too hard for me.

342
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,770
It was way too hard, so I barely made one.

343
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,390
When will I finish all 1,000?

344
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,400
What's with this ugly paper crane?

345
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,030
What were you going to wish for?

346
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,170
Were you going to wish I'd forgive you and stuff?

347
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,920
No.

348
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,790
That Lee Ji Han won't be hurt.

349
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,410
And that all the scars he got so far will all heal.

350
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,560
I didn't know.

351
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,780
I really didn't know you'd be so hurt.

352
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,980
If I tell you about the fake marriage,

353
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,090
I'd have to tell you all about Do Han's secret, too.

354
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,580
But I really couldn't do that.

355
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,830
But I wanted to be honest as soon as I could, which is why I met Do Han that day.

356
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,010
I really wasn't trying to deceive you.

357
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,550
But does this paper crane wishing really work?

358
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,440
It doesn't.

359
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,490
It doesn't?

360
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,200
It doesn't. It'd be terrible if it did.

361
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,860
What do I do?

362
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,550
What do I do about Lee Ji Han?

363
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,320
What will I do about Lee Ji Han? Lee Ji Han...

364
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,050
It works. It's effective.

365
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,060
It's effective?

366
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,660
What a relief.

367
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,150
I should make tons of pretty ones in that case.

368
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,180
Of all things, you're using a paper crane to hit on me, Na A Jeong?

369
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,300
It's made out of tissue paper, too.

370
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,730
Wait for me.

371
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,100
Are you really Lee Ji Han?

372
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,800
Let's be glad I'm the real one.

373
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,980
What's this?

374
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,560
I thought you came because you missed me. But I guess not.

375
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,620
As for that...

376
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,440
you said you didn't want to see me, Lee Ji Han.

377
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,170
That's...

378
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,870
because I wasn't sure how I should treat you.

379
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,200
I tell myself I should resent you, but seeing you pains me.

380
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,930
I tell myself I should push you away, but seeing you...

381
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,050
makes me want to hug you.

382
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,270
What am I supposed to do?

383
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,740
Let's go out and eat.

384
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,610
Hold on.

385
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,670
I have something I really want to tell you.

386
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,910
I wasn't going to deceive you to the end.

387
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,080
What I really want to tell you is, Lee Ji Han—

388
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,910
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,240
I was scared of getting hurt.

390
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,270
So I was rude to you without thinking of you getting hurt.

391
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,110
I still thought it was really fortunate.

392
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,680
I was really glad that you didn't like Brother for real

393
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,270
and that you weren't really fooled by Brother.

394
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,120
I thought it was really fortunate.

395
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,420
I thought you lost all kinds of feelings for me.

396
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,150
I even liked my sister-in-law, so how hard would it be to like a fraud?

397
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,260
No matter what happens, I'll never let go of you first.

398
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,140
I have attempted countless times already.

399
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,440
But I failed just as much.

400
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm really sorry.

401
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,420
I should be the one apologizing.

402
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,860
I'll make sure this won't ever happen again.

403
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,130
I can really promise.

404
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,300
- Did you arrive? 
  - Yes. 

405
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,710
I came inside.

406
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,760
 You got there late. 

407
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,840
No, I did come early.

408
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,150
But I just had to run into my dad.

409
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,250
He said I'm like a runaway teen these days.

410
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,740
 He lectured me, telling me to come home more often. 

411
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,110
I do need to tell Mother and Father in person, too.

412
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,320
 Let's hold that off for now. 

413
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,300
We didn't even tell Do Han yet.

414
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,690
We'll do that after talking to Do Han.

415
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,060
 I got it. 

416
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,730
Get some rest. You must be tired.

417
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,980
I'll contact you later.

418
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,460
Did you finish making up with Do Han?

419
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,530
There's no way you're already done.

420
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,310
I need to stop what I need to stop first.

421
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,620
You're able to stop it?

422
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,100
How does one end up liking his sister-in-law?

423
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,660
I beg you.

424
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,940
Don't mess with her and my brother.

425
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,450
Why shouldn't I?

426
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,120
Things were just about to become fun.

427
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,210
Isn't the company what you want?

428
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,550
What good will come out of revealing the scandal to the world?

429
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,260
The stock price will plummet for sure, and

430
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,960
even if you kick us out, you'll lose Grandfather's favor and won't get management rights.

431
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,880
What would I gain by not revealing it?

432
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,850
Brother and I will withdraw from the company.

433
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,200
You know Brother has no interest in the company in the first place if it wasn't for me.

434
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,040
You just need to take the company without any noise.

435
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,740
It sounds appealing but not really attractive.

436
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,500
It feels like I'm being lectured to and forced to compromise

437
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,970
by someone like you.

438
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,850
No way.

439
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,410
- Then? 
 - I'm begging you, desperately.

440
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,770
Is that how one desperately begs?

441
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,370
I'm sorry for what I did.

442
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,360
I was ungrateful for being taken in by the family and dared to have my way.

443
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,440
I'll never do it again.

444
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,490
I'll live as if I'm dead.

445
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,490
I won't even come near the company in the future.

446
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,180
Hey, you've matured, Ji Han!

447
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,120
It would've been nice if you knew this from the beginning.

448
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,700
All right.

449
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,530
You can't help that you didn't have a good upbringing.

450
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,950
I'll consider it optimistically.

451
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,220
Could you get up and leave now?

452
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,470
It's nice to see, but you said you won't even come around.

453
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,370
Words and actions should go hand in hand. Do you understand?

454
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,120
Get up and leave.

455
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,520
- You're here, Ms. Choi. 
 - Ahjumma.

456
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,830
Where's Grandfather?

457
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,580
He's talking to Secretary Kim in his study.

458
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,200
Okay.

459
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,980
 It looks like Seung Ah came in contact with Reporter Kang. 

460
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,400
- What? 
 - I don't know the reason.

461
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,490
But she's also searching for witnesses and CCTV footage of President Hyeon's accident.

462
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,210
She really is asking for it.

463
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,250
Chairman.

464
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,830
Why don't you give Seung Ah some shares and convince her?

465
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,880
- No. 
 - Many board members are

466
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,900
already on President Choi's side, so we can't continue—

467
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,760
I can't do that!

468
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,480
Why?

469
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,910
Why can't it be me?

470
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,840
Grandfather.

471
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,210
You even dug into me all this time?

472
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,780
Why are you going this far with me?

473
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,360
Let me ask you this, then.

474
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,120
What are you doing with Reporter Kang?

475
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,420
What exactly are you scheming that you're going around digging into things?

476
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,560
I made this clear to you.

477
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,400
Take your hands off Do Han, Ji Han, and your mother's case.

478
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,350
It's because you won't tell me clearly.

479
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,890
Why are you trying so hard to hide it?

480
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,600
It's about my mom, so what do you fear so much?

481
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,070
Grandfather.

482
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,960
I won't sit around ignorant anymore and let them take from me.

483
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,040
Take from you?

484
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,230
Was this company yours, to begin with?

485
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,050
All right.

486
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,280
You've run out of chances from hereon since you can't even tell

487
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,040
right from wrong because of your greed.

488
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,030
You got that?

489
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,350
I won't be entrusting you with the company.

490
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,820
So leave now.

491
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,190
Yes.

492
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,860
Did I even have a chance?

493
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,990
Regardless of what I achieve or what they do,

494
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,920
the result would've been the same.

495
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,200
Yes, Reporter Kang.

496
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,340
It's me.

497
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,550
   

498
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,450
   
   

499
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,700
- Please enjoy. 
  - It's her. It sure is. 

500
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,970
Aren't they staring too blatantly?

501
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,600
But they're talking while looking at us. Right?

502
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,410
Hey, aren't you the one who came out on the new Wednesday/Thursday drama?

503
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,070
What was the title?

504
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,540
The modern girl who's an independence fighter, right?

505
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,470
Yes, it's me.

506
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,100
- She's my friend. 
 - Do you want an autograph?

507
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,400
 - It's her?  
 - On the house.

508
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,190
 - This is crazy. 
 - She's really shameless. 

509
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,440
Unni! Unnis!

510
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,330
Look. Take a look at this.

511
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,730
   

512
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,880
   
   

513
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,140
   

514
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,280
   

515
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,900
   
   

516
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,250
   
   

517
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,390
 Isn't this nuts? How can a sister-in-law and a brother-in-law have an affair? 

518
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,940
 I feel sorry for the brother the most. 

519
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,250
 Who is this woman? 

520
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,410
 She's in our industry. She had taken a role through nepotism before. 

521
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,480
 - I think she's got a conglomerate connection. 
 - She's not right in her head. 

522
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,350
 Is this a true story? 

523
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,870
What's everyone talking about, Unni?

524
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,480
Say something. Huh?

525
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,380
It's really...

526
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,690
hopeless.

527
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,040
Unni...

528
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,360
Not for me. For him.

529
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,040
Who are you worrying about now?

530
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,570
All the blame's being directed at you right now!

531
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,370
That's why it's hopeful for me.

532
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,270
- What? 
 - Because I'm getting all the blame,

533
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,620
people are criticizing me and me only.

534
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,630
Calling me a femme fatale,

535
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,470
addicted to men,

536
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,420
and a wicked woman who seduced the two brothers...

537
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,180
If this was a scandal with anyone else,

538
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,360
I'd have cursed the moment it broke out,

539
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,020
saying, "F*** this. I'm done with life."

540
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,290
But why am I actually glad things turned out this way?

541
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,180
I think I should get going.

542
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,490
Where are you going?

543
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,330
Home.

544
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,390
Wait. Does this mean all of this is true?

545
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,510
So, Unni's dating her brother-in-law. Right?

546
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,050
What the heck is he doing right now?

547
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,350
What's this? What's all of this about?

548
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:47,200
How on earth are you behaving for such trashy articles to be circulating? Huh?

549
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,980
I thought... I thought I could finally rest assured.

550
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,810
But you just had to cause the nastiest problem.

551
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,200
What are you doing? Get out of here right now.

552
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,290
Get out and come up with a press release.

553
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,520
Tell them it's a lie and a rumor.

554
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,440
Hurry up and get out, you punk!

555
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,990
I can't do that.

556
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,070
- What? 
 - It's just as the articles say.

557
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,060
I like Na A Jeong.

558
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,230
I don't wish to explain myself or deny them.

559
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,370
Do you even know what you're saying?

560
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,080
What about your brother? How about him?

561
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,200
You supported this marriage the most in the first place! So what's the matter?

562
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,500
Grandfather, I thought I had been living for Brother's sake all my life.

563
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,720
- What? 
 - Forcing him to take the company and get married,

564
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,950
I thought they were all good for Brother, but...

565
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,480
I finally realized it after coming this far.

566
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,580
That I was wrong.

567
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,590
That everything was my greed.

568
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,430
- Yeah? 
 - Anyhow, it was my decision.

569
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,740
So I'll take responsibility for everything.

570
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,960
Na A Jeong, if you're in there, please give us an answer!

571
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,220
Please state your position!

572
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,620
Is it true you're dating LJ Group's grandson?

573
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,590
Last time was nothing. You can't even compare to this one.

574
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,130
After Soo Jeong drops off Ji Oh at his aunt's, tell Soo Jeong—

575
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,100
Never mind. Just tell her to stay the night.

576
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,080
- She probably can't come in anyway. 
 - Okay.

577
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,040
Gosh, how could this happen?

578
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,550
A Jeong, did your in-laws contact you?

579
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,080
My, did you forget how to talk?

580
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,720
Try calling them.

581
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,190
Just because we've got conglomerate in-laws, this is happening not once but twice.

582
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:14,680
On top of that, they've got a ridiculously fabricated scandal to give us a hard time, so—

583
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,120
Wow, I don't know if it's AI or deep fake nowadays...

584
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,670
Man, what a scary world, huh?

585
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,690
It looks so real. Look.

586
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,510
   

587
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,330
But is it the background?

588
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,800
I can just tell this is the playground in our neighborhood.

589
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,720
If it's this good, I'd believe it if they said it was real, not fabricated—

590
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,400
I'm sorry.

591
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,750
A Jeong!

592
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,830
Aren't you going to contact them?

593
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,920
Should I do it?

594
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,000
It's all true.

595
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,560
I said it's all true.

596
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,370
I have feelings for that man.

597
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,330
What are you saying right now?

598
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,800
What about the date you had with Do Han a few days ago?

599
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,840
I finished talking with Do Han, and we'll scrap our marriage, too.

600
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,320
I finished talking with Do Han, and we'll scrap our marriage, too.

601
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,660
Hey, A Jeong, are you going to keep joking?

602
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,380
You...

603
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,440
Are you serious?

604
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,820
Yes.

605
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,960
- Wait— 
 - H-Honey!

606
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,600
- Are you crazy? 
 - Honey.

607
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,760
How can you cheat on him even before the wedding?

608
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,450
On top of that, with your brother-in-law?

609
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,410
- Are you even human? Are you? 
 - Gosh, stop it!

610
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,410
Stop it now! You'll kill her, Dong Ok!

611
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,960
Get your acts together!

612
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
I don't even want to see you! Go to your room!

613
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,750
H-Honey! Honey!

614
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,130
How dare you come here?

615
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,740
Are you crazy?

616
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,300
If you come here now, you're basically admitting that the scandal is true.

617
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,740
I'm sorry.

618
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,810
I didn't think it'd turn out like this.

619
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,980
Is Na A Jeong okay?

620
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,460
My sister?

621
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,010
Are you asking if Sis is okay right now?

622
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,500
Try to think here. How could she be okay?

623
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:45,620
She cried. Na A Jeong cried because of you!

624
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,780
I don't know how great your love for each other is,

625
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,810
but is it so great that it's worth ruining each other's life?

626
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,410
I'll give up everything.

627
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,280
I can do it.

628
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,400
Give up my sister, too, then.

629
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,510
Because the best thing to do for my sister

630
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,130
would be for you to give her up.

631
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,270
 I feel a great sense of responsibility regarding my brother's recent misconduct. 

632
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,950
 Once again, I'd like to apologize to everyone 

633
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,910
 who got hurt and damaged by this. 

634
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,650
Man, the duality.

635
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:44,680
 I just want to say once again this matter has completely nothing to do with LJ Group. 

636
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,740
Gosh, this was what she was telling us to watch, huh?

637
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,170
But isn't she a genius?

638
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,200
Is she really my sibling? Don't you think we might have different fathers, too?

639
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,320
Honey!

640
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,160
Should we be happy right now?

641
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,270
We finally got to side with Ji Han and Yoon Chae Won.

642
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:05,550
Now, we've even got some trashy drama plot going on.

643
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,680
Our shares are as good as toilet paper now!

644
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,590
You're right.

645
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,010
Should we tell Grandfather? She told on us, too!

646
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,590
Is he going to forgive us if we tell on her?

647
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,810
You know how Grandfather is!

648
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,650
We'd just end up in the streets together.

649
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,550
I don't know anymore. What do we do about this?

650
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,790
Honey, you just need to watch.

651
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,490
I'll blackmail that brat Choi Seung Ah or something and take care of it.

652
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,270
 - What do you want?  
 - She picked up!

653
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,570
Speaker! Speaker!

654
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,100
Hey, you looked great on screen.

655
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,340
Do you know a good surgeon?

656
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,840
 Yes. Thanks, bye. 

657
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,580
H-Hey, Choi Seung Ah, your older brother's still talking.

658
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,100
 - What now?  
 - It was you, right? You leaked it. Right?

659
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,530
What would you do if I told Grandfather about this?

660
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,570
Yeah, it was me. Do whatever you want. Bye.

661
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,040
Was it Min Woong?

662
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,600
Yes.

663
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,800
I'm glad I have you, at least.

664
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,620
Our company will finally get moving smoothly.

665
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,530
Even if the board's still on your grandfather's side,

666
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:25,410
they can't overlook a trashy scandal like this if they've got any sense of shame.

667
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,720
Why couldn't I think of this sooner?

668
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,350
I didn't have to wait anxiously to become the heir.

669
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,690
I just had to take it from him.

670
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,890
Please take care of things at Taeyang.

671
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,540
So there won't be headaches later.

672
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,150
I'll do that.

673
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,620
Oh, right.

674
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,600
Father,

675
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,170
I have something to ask you.

676
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:56,940
Is there anything you know regarding Mother's accident?

677
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,740
I feel like Grandfather's hiding something,

678
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,730
but he just won't tell me.

679
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:10,610
I'm not sure. I don't really know.

680
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:14,350
Right? It can't be helped, then.

681
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,130
 Do Han... I still cherish him. 

682
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,430
 I'm going to do anything to protect him. 

683
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,580
Do people usually say they'll protect someone they cheated on?

684
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:03,410
I'm sure you had many reporters on you, so thank you for making it here.

685
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,590
Why did you want to see me?

686
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,190
Is there anything else we should talk about besides those two?

687
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,380
You know something, right, Lee Do Han?

688
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,600
Those two aren't simply having an affair, are they?

689
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,530
No matter how I think about this, I don't think those two would ever betray you.

690
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,100
Well, what makes you think so?

691
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,600
You know better than I do how dearly they care about you.

692
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,770
And this is the result?

693
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,080
I'll take care of it.

694
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,390
So, there really is something.

695
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,270
I'm not happy that those two are together, either.

696
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:49,590
But it's wrong to be caught up in a witch hunt for something they didn't do.

697
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:54,570
At least, shouldn't you not sit back like this since you care about them more than I do?

698
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:16,330
 Someone took all the CCTV footage around the accident site of your mother. 

699
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,190
 I've been looking for them, but I couldn't find a single one. 

700
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:24,490
 As if someone hid them intentionally. 

701
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:30,370
 In my opinion, they might be stored in Chairman Hyeon's house. 

702
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,600
What exactly is he trying to hide so badly?

703
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,560
 You can't put just enough effort to protect those two. 

704
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,230
 I think I was ashamed of you for the first time in my life. 

705
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,380
 Na A Jeong said she doesn't want to. 

706
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,200
 How long will you use her as your tool? 

707
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,220
 Hello. 

708
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,850
Why aren't you telling the reporters?

709
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,430
You could tell them the truth.

710
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,350
The marriage was actually fake. Lee Do Han is gay.

711
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:05,670
 You have no reason to be Joan of Arc and be burned at the stake in front of the nation. 

712
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,810
Do Han...

713
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,350
I won't do that now...

714
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:14,380
and I don't plan on doing that, either.

715
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,140
I'm okay.

716
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,750
So, don't be anxious...

717
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,860
and don't worry, either.

718
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,340
Let me ask you one last time.

719
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,530
Won't you go to New York, though it's late?

720
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,620
 I won't. 

721
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,940
I don't want to run away.

722
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,380
I'm going to endure it to the end.

723
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:40,080
I'm going to endure it like this to protect you and Lee Ji Han.

724
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,790
So, you'll protect everyone else and only sacrifice yourself?

725
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,260
 How am I only sacrificing myself? 

726
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,670
I'm protecting myself as well.

727
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,600
Since I'm protecting my everything, I'm protecting myself.

728
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,560
 Hey, you said this a bit earlier. 

729
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,040
 That I might not have loved someone enough to beat friendship. 

730
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,480
 But I thought about it. Do you have to choose one over the other? 

731
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,320
 Think about it. If I think so dearly of that person, 

732
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,500
 that person must also think dearly of me. 

733
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,140
 Would he just watch me choose one over the other? 

734
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,330
 Then? 

735
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:27,450
 I think he'd just stay by my side quietly, 

736
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,900
 protecting me, no matter what happens. 

737
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,410
 - I think I'd do that. 
 - Whoa. 

738
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,940
 So, you'd better be good to me. 

739
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,560
 Be loyal. Okay? 

740
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,460
How can you still be exactly the same?

741
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,990
 Huh? 

742
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,640
Never mind. Let's hang up.

743
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,630
I'll call you again next time.

744
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,060
Did you talk it out with Brother?

745
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,470
Yes.

746
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:46,510
I'm glad.

747
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:50,650
It was so hard to come all the way here secretly.

748
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,500
It was a bit easier since I have experience.

749
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,660
I'm proud of you but don't try too hard to act okay.

750
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,040
I'm not acting.

751
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,270
Really.

752
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,810
You should believe me now.

753
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:11,430
Honestly, I really wasn't okay earlier.

754
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,040
But I'm a bit okay now.

755
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,390
I'm happy.

756
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,580
It looks like you weren't okay at all.

757
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,000
They look sore.

758
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,370
You're crying a lot after meeting me, Na A Jeong.

759
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,080
Why? Do you regret it?

760
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,700
That you should've treated me well?

761
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,550
- A little bit? 
 - Why don't you treat me well now, then?

762
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,620
Make me laugh.

763
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,340
No problem.

764
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,830
What do you want? What kind of show do you want?

765
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,260
Singing?

766
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,680
Or do you want dancing?

767
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,650
Or do you want some b-backflip?

768
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,450
Give me a hug.

769
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:08,250
♫  So we don't get hurt anymore  ♫

770
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,580
♫  The place where the well-rounded  ♫

771
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,270
Don't worry too much.

772
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:18,000
I have many reasons to laugh, as there are reasons to cry.

773
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,700
We'll call it even.

774
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,600
I want you to only laugh, Na A Jeong.

775
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,220
That's called insanity.

776
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,820
Is that it?

777
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,690
I just wanted to see your face.

778
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,730
I gave this some thought.

779
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,890
It feels really great when I'm hugging you,

780
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,110
but I can't really see you.

781
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,920
I can see everything else,

782
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,000
but you're the only one.

783
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,620
I don't even know if you're crying or laughing.

784
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,570
We couldn't see each other all day.

785
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,050
Well, I don't know when I'll get to see you again because of the reporters.

786
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,680
So, I should stare long and hard at every detail of your face.

787
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,780
The press conference is ready.

788
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,950
 A Jeong, 

789
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,710
 I'm texting you because I didn't get to tell you this properly yesterday. 

790
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,640
 I'm sorry. 

791
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,710
 I asked for this marriage to create some breathing room for myself. 

792
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,180
 But I think I was smothering you in the process. 

793
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,900
 I realized that much too late. 

794
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,330
 However, I'm not going to run away this time. 

795
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:24,000
 So, I'm going to protect you, and... 

796
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,430
 I'm going to protect Ji Han. 

797
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,480
 And... 

798
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,820
 I'm going to protect myself. 

799
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,080
Hello.

800
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,060
I'm Lee Ji Han, the fourth grandchild of LJ Group.

801
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,280
Grandfather.

802
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,570
You fool.

803
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:43,620
Your grandpa gave you so many chances to keep it down and move on quietly all this time.

804
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:49,830
But must you tell the world about what kind of person you always were

805
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,460
to make yourself happy?

806
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:03,250
I'm sincerely sorry for causing the recent controversy.

807
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,980
I asked for today's press conference because...

808
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,770
there's one thing I must correct...

809
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,550
while apologizing publicly.

810
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,880
As per what you know currently,

811
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,200
the scandal with my brother, his fiancée,

812
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,620
and myself isn't...

813
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,540
true as it stands.

814
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,400
She did nothing wrong.

815
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,950
I followed her around on my own.

816
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,620
The only correct fact regarding this scandal is...

817
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,560
the fact that...

818
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,140
I have feelings for her.

819
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,400
That I really like her.

820
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,740
That's all.

821
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,360
That much is...

822
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,800
true.

823
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:33,480


824
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:42,360
♫  The long days made my heart indifferent  ♫

825
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:56,600
♫  The night I was too worn out to even cry anymore  ♫

826
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,960
   

827
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,600
 Even if the entire world doesn't know, I'm happy as long as you know my sincerity. 

828
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,150
 This is the best decision I can make. 

829
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,390
 You can resent me all you want. 

830
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,420
 It's making me angry now. 

831
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,650
 He told me not to cry and made me stop crying like this. 

832
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,540
 Let's go our own ways and live happily now. 

833
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,870
 I like him. 

834
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,340
 I can't live without him anymore, 

835
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,010
 but I don't even know where he is right now. 

836
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:28,790
 I want to be forgotten as soon as possible. 

837
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,420
 Hi, Lee Ji Han. 

838
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:38,700
♫  The overdue happiness will sprout and bloom in the end  ♫
