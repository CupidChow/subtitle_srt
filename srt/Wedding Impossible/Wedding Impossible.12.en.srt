1
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,184
-I'll shoot now.
-Okay.

2
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,186
Grin a little more.

3
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,361
Which one's pretty?

4
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,948
I think these two look good.

5
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,074
What about you?

6
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:15,951
How are you doing?

7
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,912
I like them too.

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,213
Hello, I came to hand in my profile.

9
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,923
Leave it here.

10
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,425
All right. Thank you.

11
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,345
I'm doing well.

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,973
I thought I'd only think of you every day,

13
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,434
but maybe because I'm so busy,

14
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,645
that's actually not the case.

15
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,528
I thought of you...

16
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,573
just once in a while.

17
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,160
Sometimes while walking...

18
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,747
Sometimes while eating.

19
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,544
Okay, cut.

20
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,758
One more time.

21
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,052
A-jung.

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,846
-I'm sorry.
-Didn't you practice?

23
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:17,805
I did.

24
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,723
I'll try it again. I'm sorry.

25
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:20,808
Seriously...

26
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,309
-Let's go again.
-Okay.

27
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,936
Sometimes while working...

28
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,396
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

29
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,941
...or while taking a break,

30
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,574
I thought of you once in a while.

31
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:44,999
Thanks to those moments,

32
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,751
I think I'm doing well,

33
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,921
making it through.

34
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,634
It seems like it'll rain soon.

35
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,767
So,

36
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,353
I hope you do well too.

37
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:16,572
Director Choi Min-woong of LJ Hotel and
Choi Seung-a of LJ Department Store

38
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,034
are doing volunteer work again this year
to honor their late mother.

39
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,621
This is their first official appearance
since Choi Jung-chan,

40
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,458
the former president of LJ,
was arrested for embezzlement,

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,793
and the former chairman resigned.

42
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,045
-The scandal
-Terry.

43
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,047
surrounding LJ Group's family...

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,214
See you later.

45
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,342
It's being mentioned again.

46
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,929
But unlike last year,
the public's opinion is more positive.

47
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,806
There are supporters
of the previous owners,

48
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,434
and the situation has taken a new turn.

49
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,146
The political and financial figures
are focused on how long this...

50
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:20,154
FINAL EPISODE

51
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,296
I thought everyone
would come in the morning.

52
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,216
I didn't expect to run into you.

53
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,095
I came to see your mother.

54
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,723
I almost became her daughter-in-law.

55
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,644
I've felt bad thinking she might blame me

56
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,480
for ruining her sons.

57
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,856
I didn't say anything.

58
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,483
I mean...

59
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,861
I just thought you might
misunderstand and think...

60
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,030
"Is she here to see me?"

61
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,325
"Is she still not over me?"

62
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,993
That's a misunderstanding?

63
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,836
It feels like yesterday
that I came here last year.

64
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,299
But Do-han's in New York.
Did anyone else come?

65
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,593
Grandpa came a while ago.

66
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,137
Is he doing well?

67
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,555
Yes.

68
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,767
I heard about him from Mr. Kim and Taek.

69
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:36,188
It's been a while since I saw him.
But he seemed to be doing well.

70
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,398
And he seemed different.

71
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,152
I'm glad to hear that.

72
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,917
Oh, and your family...

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,961
They're doing great.

74
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,547
Too great, I guess.

75
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,969
Oh, right.
Ji-oh entered elementary school.

76
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,096
-Already?
-Yes.

77
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,351
Wow! Ji-oh's a genius!

78
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,813
He seems to have taken after me.

79
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,897
Dad!

80
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,359
Don't say such a thing!

81
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,822
I meant my brains, not my hair.

82
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,660
That's even worse.
At least you can plant hair.

83
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,621
You two are so mean to me.

84
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,248
Please!

85
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,334
Please be quiet.

86
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,295
-It's okay for you, Ji-oh.
-Okay.

87
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,131
You know how tough writer's block is.

88
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,925
Gosh, you're making such a fuss.

89
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,388
If you can't focus, just come
and trim the bean sprouts.

90
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,183
A fuss, Mother?

91
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,227
I get a hundred thousand views
per chapter!

92
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:01,732
Our long-awaited project of planting
Father's hair. It took just one chapter.

93
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,817
It's 50 million won!

94
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,362
Yeah, sure. Our dear writer should
go and keep writing, then.

95
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,617
We will keep our mouths zipped.

96
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,577
Thank you.

97
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,829
It's crazy, right?

98
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,206
That little jerk.

99
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,291
Tae-min's success is more shocking

100
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,462
than my dad's new hair.
How did he change so much in just a year?

101
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,214
But what's even more shocking

102
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,590
is Taek and Ji-ae.

103
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,385
Oh, right. Those two.

104
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,721
No, my Tinkerbell!

105
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,015
Wait.

106
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,684
You're pregnant. I'll do it for you.

107
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,437
Just sit and rest, all right?

108
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,649
-But why are you so pretty?
-Oh, stop!

109
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,238
Hang on. I'll do that for you.

110
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,448
Just think good thoughts

111
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,742
and rest comfortably.

112
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,453
The food's ready.

113
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,413
Eat before it gets cold.

114
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,250
Wait, you're not flying, are you?

115
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,918
Oh, come on!

116
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,836
-Here, Ji-ae.
-Thanks.

117
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,130
Let's eat.

118
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,174
It looks good.

119
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,178
What was that?

120
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,598
You're having morning sickness
for her too?

121
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,809
That's nonsense.

122
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,143
Eat carefully.

123
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,314
It's delicious.

124
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,656
No way. For real?

125
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,950
He even has morning sickness.

126
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,494
Should I put this away?

127
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,246
No, just eat.

128
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:41,832
It's good.

129
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,376
Getting pregnant before marriage?

130
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,671
I was surprised at Taek.

131
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,756
That's what Ji-ae's like.

132
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,511
Still, I'm glad everyone's doing well.

133
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,346
Right.

134
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,853
Is there anyone else?

135
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,896
-There is.
-Who?

136
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,814
Us.

137
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,570
Let's talk about us, not everyone else.

138
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,783
How have you been, A-jung?
Did you do well without me?

139
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,496
I've...

140
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,498
been great.

141
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,835
I'm popular these days.

142
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,047
I'm getting pretty big roles in TV shows.

143
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,590
I saw you.

144
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,216
You did?

145
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,220
You think I was somewhere without any TV?

146
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,849
But it's not that I was
watching you all the time.

147
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,893
I just saw on TV.

148
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,646
You were the male lead's girlfriend.

149
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,523
On TV...

150
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,693
But

151
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,279
I was his ex, not his girlfriend.

152
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,197
Right.

153
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,908
That would be the female lead.

154
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,494
-Oh, right.
-You didn't even

155
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,621
watch the show properly.

156
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,122
Well, I was too busy.

157
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,792
I started a business with Taek.

158
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,918
You heard, right?

159
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,503
And it's doing

160
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,546
better than I thought.

161
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,341
It might compete with LJ soon.

162
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,553
You seem to be doing well too.

163
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,306
I thought you'd be sad without me.

164
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,312
I thought of you now and then.

165
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,288
I should get going now.

166
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,249
I'm late.

167
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,710
Oh, should I take you home?

168
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,172
No, my manager's waiting downstairs.

169
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,175
I just dropped by on my way somewhere.

170
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,969
Wow, a manager.

171
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,557
Here.

172
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,726
I have another one in the car.

173
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,271
Take it.

174
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,569
Carry an umbrella around, okay?

175
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,362
You hate rain.

176
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,744
Bye, then.

177
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,977
-She's here.
-Hey.

178
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,521
Auntie's here!

179
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,648
-I'm here.
-You're home.

180
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,609
Welcome home, superstar.

181
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,152
Hello.

182
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,987
Very funny.

183
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,572
Auntie!

184
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,781
Ji-oh!

185
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,327
Did you give your friends my autographs?

186
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,995
Yes.

187
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,165
But they still don't believe
you're my aunt.

188
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,291
What?

189
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,127
Why are kids so full of doubt?

190
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,630
She should take a photo with you.

191
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,798
Will a photo be enough?

192
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,136
I should pick you up
from school next time.

193
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,348
Yes! Awesome!

194
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,474
Please!

195
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,560
Please be quiet.

196
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,145
It's okay for you, Ji-oh.

197
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:37,025
I barely managed to focus
and write one line, but A-jung suddenly--

198
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,903
You're the loudest here, Tae-min!

199
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,905
That's enough, all right?

200
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,032
-Jeez.
-Good job, Honey.

201
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,910
-Great.
-Bad job, Honey.

202
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,995
Come on, Honey.

203
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,914
I got him that hair.

204
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,707
I should go get some rest.

205
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,334
Right, good night.

206
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,088
Ji-oh needs to rest too, right?

207
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,757
-She must be tired.
-Let's go to bed.

208
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,324
I'm sorry I couldn't keep the promise

209
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,744
to take care of your son.

210
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,748
I only made it more difficult

211
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,626
for both of your sons.

212
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,940
I'm glad he's doing well, though.

213
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,070
I should've done this at the start.

214
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,992
It was the right thing.

215
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,320
I haven't come here

216
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,781
since I broke up with you.

217
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,743
Because there was no reason to.

218
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,705
Even if there was, I wouldn't have
in case it reminded me of you.

219
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,541
-How have you been?
-"How have you been?"

220
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,543
What about you?

221
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,421
-I've been great.
-"I've been great."

222
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:05,924
That's good.

223
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,682
Because there was no reason to.

224
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,102
Even if there was, I wouldn't have
in case it reminded me of you.

225
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,313
How have you been?

226
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,108
Not good at all.

227
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,693
What about you?

228
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,444
I've been great.

229
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,488
I thought of her now and then...

230
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,449
-That's good.
-But put together,

231
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,660
it's an entire day.

232
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,970
Because there was no reason to.

233
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,348
Even if there was, I wouldn't have
in case it reminded me of you.

234
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,934
How have you been?

235
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,061
What about you?

236
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,522
I've been great.

237
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,571
How have you been?

238
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,663
The volunteer work was so tough this time.

239
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,623
My arms still hurt.

240
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,626
Oh, no. Your arms have grown so thick.

241
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,256
Don't do it, then. There's no one
to judge you. No need to force yourself.

242
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,384
Why do you do it, then?
We do it because of you.

243
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:35,263
You're really asking why?
Volunteer work comes from a good heart.

244
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,517
I'm not buying it.
You should do volunteer work for us first.

245
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,436
-Why?
-It's obvious.

246
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,063
We're the most pitiful people around you.

247
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,901
Thanks to you, the board was destroyed,
Father went to jail,

248
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,986
and Grandfather resigned.

249
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,656
And now, Mr. Kim suddenly
became the president.

250
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,533
This is just crazy.

251
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,788
Well, let's say I really did
destroy the board.

252
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,040
Why is the embezzlement my fault?

253
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,167
It's all your fault!

254
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,418
Even without proof,

255
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,004
your weird white clothes say it's true.

256
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,590
Why are you dressed like that?

257
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,843
Right, you've aged a year.

258
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,595
You've gotten a bit smarter.

259
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,721
What?

260
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:18,765
What do you mean?

261
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,768
It's nothing, forget it.

262
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,772
Secretary Kim!

263
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,486
He's LJ's president now, remember?

264
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,991
We've known each other for a long time.
It's more comfortable

265
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,160
calling each other casually, right?

266
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,124
No, Mr. Choi.

267
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,170
What brought you here again today?

268
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,799
I can't just focus on the hotel forever.

269
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,300
I thought you could...

270
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:59,931
Can't you find
a different position for him?

271
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,892
Like LJ Electronics or Products.

272
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,854
Well,

273
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,314
I don't think that will happen.

274
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,484
And you, Ms. Choi?

275
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,196
Oh, I just came
to watch these two doing this.

276
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,079
I hope you won't be like this
at the family gathering.

277
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,582
Family gathering? Why?

278
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,208
"Why"?

279
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,878
Do-han's returning today.

280
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,966
Do-han!

281
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,426
A-jung!

282
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,263
-Hey, have you been well?
-Yes.

283
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,974
You look happier than before.

284
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,685
I was just upset the last time you saw me.

285
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,354
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

286
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,939
Did you rent a car again?

287
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,941
No, it's mine.

288
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,068
You bought one? What is it?

289
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,617
How is my new car?

290
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,077
It's great.

291
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,412
It's really comfy.

292
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,539
-Right? I've succeeded.
-Yes.

293
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,875
It's not as good as the last car,

294
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,836
but at least I'm not hiding anything now.

295
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,049
Anyway, you should rest today.

296
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,261
You'll be busy
since you're here for your exhibit, right?

297
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,554
I'm not that busy.

298
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,640
Really?

299
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,934
Then let's have a drink soon.

300
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,977
That sounds awesome.

301
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,397
Should we call Ji-han?

302
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,987
Right, now that we're being honest,
let me ask you this.

303
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,572
Will you really not date Ji-han?

304
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,285
-That's random.
-Random?

305
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,329
I kept asking you in New York.

306
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,374
You always pretended
the signal was weak and hung up.

307
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,626
Oh, right. I was lousy.

308
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,211
Yes. Jeez.

309
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,050
I know you feel guilty,

310
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,387
but I'm really happy.

311
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,430
I feel stronger

312
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,932
and more confident.

313
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,101
I mean it.

314
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,936
Right.

315
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,480
So I want you to feel at ease.

316
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,818
Wow...

317
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,238
You've really grown up, Do-han!

318
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,199
But Do-han,

319
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,326
I'm really doing great.

320
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,872
I'm really enjoying acting,

321
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,041
and everything else.

322
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,927
All right, then.

323
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:58,568
Ji-han.

324
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,446
Ji-han!

325
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,450
Oh, hey.

326
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,663
Welcome back. Go and get some rest.

327
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,082
You seem to need more rest than me.

328
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,961
Go and sleep in your bed.

329
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,046
Okay.

330
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,005
Ji-han!

331
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,011
You're up early.

332
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,472
Hey, come and eat.

333
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,058
You look better today.

334
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,144
I was exhausted from work yesterday.

335
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,522
This looks delicious.

336
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:37,940
Try it.

337
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,907
How is your first homemade meal in a year?

338
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,203
It's good.
I could never make this taste in New York.

339
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,539
Right, there are ingredients
you can't get there.

340
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,708
What ingredients?

341
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,293
Love and affection.

342
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,630
Gross, I lost my appetite.

343
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm just kidding.

344
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,014
You really must've missed it.

345
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,724
You're even eating carrots.

346
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,852
I've grown up. I'm a year older now.

347
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,270
Is that so?

348
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,148
Then have some more.

349
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,693
I must be old.
I can't eat well now that I'm older.

350
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,829
Work is an excuse.
Is it because of A-jung?

351
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,834
You're still not in touch?

352
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,710
It's not like that.

353
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,047
It obviously is.

354
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,178
GRANDPA

355
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,517
Yes, Grandpa.

356
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,527
Is Do-han back now?

357
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,321
Yes.

358
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,534
He's at his studio.

359
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,703
He's busy with work.

360
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,123
I didn't ask. I'm sure he's busy.

361
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,918
You're the strange one,

362
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,422
coming along
on your grandpa's fishing trip.

363
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,466
Don't you have a girlfriend?

364
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,510
No.

365
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,765
What about A-jung?

366
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,729
I can't date her.

367
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,191
Why not?

368
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,072
Right, it's a bit... Right.

369
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,744
Why did you have to ask?

370
00:24:58,706 --> 00:24:59,540
Hey.

371
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,044
Here.

372
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,421
Take this.

373
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,008
Why do you have this?

374
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,135
FORGIVING A MISTAKE COUPON

375
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,304
I gave this to Mr. Kim when I was little.

376
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,349
-I bought it.
-What?

377
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,227
I bought it from Mr. Kim.

378
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,190
How could he sell this?

379
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,943
And how could you buy this?

380
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,029
It was really expensive.

381
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,073
Anyway...

382
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,869
I'll use that, so you should forget
everything I did

383
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:40,081
to you and A-jung. Understand?

384
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,083
What's gotten into you?

385
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,878
When I went to see your mother,

386
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,339
I saw you two together.

387
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,008
She seems

388
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:52,927
like a good kid.

389
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:58,057
Even after what happened,
she still came to see your mother.

390
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,189
I felt grateful and sorry.

391
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,820
Anyway, I used that coupon, so we're even.

392
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:15,283
So don't use me as an excuse
and start seeing her and stuff. All right?

393
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,662
It's not like that.

394
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,539
I just...

395
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,792
feel too sorry.

396
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,003
Plus, it's been a year...

397
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:28,921
I mean...

398
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,383
A-jung didn't seem to be doing so well.

399
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,178
You too.

400
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,184
Gosh, I must've picked the wrong spot.

401
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,490
Why did Grandpa say that now?

402
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,633
Ji-oh.

403
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,639
What a nice car.

404
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,099
-It is.
-What?

405
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,350
It looks nice.

406
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,394
-Ji-oh.
-Yes?

407
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,729
I'll buy you a nice car like that too.

408
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:10,815
What about me?

409
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,620
You're still oversleeping at your age?

410
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,830
-I'm late.
-A-jung...

411
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,582
-You...
-Have a great day, superstar.

412
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:40,761
Ji-han?

413
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,081
It really is you.

414
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,834
What are you doing here?

415
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,296
Oh, right.

416
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,758
Your umbrella. In case you need it.

417
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,094
What?

418
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,641
Well, you might need it.

419
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,311
You should always be prepared.

420
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,189
It could suddenly rain.
Then you'll blame me.

421
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,409
I came to talk to you as well.

422
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,953
We didn't talk honestly last time.

423
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,375
I guess it could be a parasol.

424
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,294
What?

425
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,469
But that's not the problem.
Give me a ride.

426
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,513
-What?
-I'm shooting today,

427
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,431
but my manager's sick today,

428
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,225
so I need a ride there.

429
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:10,893
Give me a ride.

430
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,354
-What?
-Come on!

431
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,606
Go. I'm late.

432
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,837
You didn't have to follow us
all the way here.

433
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,632
I should always be with you. Be careful.

434
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,259
What if you collapse?

435
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,843
-Oh, gosh.
-Let's go.

436
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,262
Sorry.

437
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,515
Taek, you seem weaker than Ji-ae.

438
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,642
-Let's go.
-Hurry up.

439
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:00,192
Darn it, why isn't he picking up?

440
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:03,070
Is he doing his job or not?

441
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,593
This tastes good.

442
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:34,101
This isn't the main scene,
but it's an important one.

443
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,813
I know. Don't worry.
I'm fully prepared for it today.

444
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,231
I knew it.

445
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,774
-I'm counting on you.
-Okay.

446
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,109
-Get ready.
-Yes, sir.

447
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,319
-See you later.
-Okay.

448
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,244
You're really being treated differently.

449
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,830
I told you, I've succeeded.

450
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,334
How did you know I needed my bag?

451
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,380
You're my manager today,
so I'm depending on you.

452
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:06,925
-By the way,
-Yes?

453
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,302
what did you prepare?

454
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,888
An action scene? Horseback riding?

455
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,181
No, it's not.

456
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,100
That's a relief.
I was worried you'd get hurt again.

457
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:18,145
How can you do an action scene
or horseback riding here?

458
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,105
Right.

459
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,649
Then what?

460
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,318
A kiss scene.

461
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:29,823
What?

462
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,201
A kiss scene?

463
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,536
Yes. Why?

464
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,582
How could you say that to me
as if it's nothing?

465
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:39,750
What?

466
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,543
I can't believe this.

467
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,254
Weren't you worried I'd get hurt?

468
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,881
Now my heart's hurt.

469
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,259
-A-jung.
-Yes?

470
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,344
-Hey.
-Hi.

471
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,930
-When did you get here?
-Two hours ago.

472
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,227
The kiss scene?

473
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,395
Oh, here.

474
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,188
-Is there something there?
-Yes.

475
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,983
Stop it.

476
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,610
Stop what?

477
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,779
He's my manager for today.

478
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:12,950
Manager. Right.

479
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:17,663
I've been offered to be an actor,
but never to be a manager, so...

480
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,873
That's why you didn't seem close.

481
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,418
But we're really close.

482
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,752
It was just a prank.

483
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,755
-Right.
-Oh, you're close.

484
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,590
That's a relief.

485
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,553
Awkward relationships tend
to develop into romance.

486
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,763
There will be no scandal, then.

487
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,143
There's no need for that, though.

488
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,602
We're already past that point.

489
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,273
What do you mean?

490
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,988
What's with you two?

491
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,950
-A-jung.
-That's enough.

492
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,161
You too.

493
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,746
All right.

494
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,705
What?

495
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,249
What was that?

496
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,835
What's gotten into you?

497
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:05,961
What was that?

498
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,422
Cut it out. You're embarrassing me.

499
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,215
-Do I embarrass you?
-Stop it.

500
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,719
A-jung...

501
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,596
They're really tall.

502
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,391
Have you gone mad?

503
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,350
Have you?

504
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,478
You know how huge the project is!

505
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,855
You want to lose it?

506
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,026
I had no choice but to take a leave

507
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,778
because Ji-ae is pregnant,

508
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,907
but what the hell are you doing here?

509
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,658
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,286
Apologizing won't solve...

511
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:44,875
Hey, Ji-han.

512
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,585
What?

513
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:47,920
What? What's wrong?

514
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,382
Right. It's high time
we spoke casually with each other.

515
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,676
I'm not your employee anymore.

516
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,262
We're business partners now.

517
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,640
Besides, I'm much older than you

518
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,433
and used to be your senior.

519
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,310
You just had your background.

520
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:10,359
You still seem to think
you're a part of a rich family.

521
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,320
How long do you have to starve
to get a grip?

522
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,406
You have no desperation at all.

523
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,575
You're the one who kept saying

524
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,536
we can't lose the project!

525
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,163
Let me off the hook today.

526
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,917
Something more important than that
is on the line right now.

527
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,590
We can't let that happen.

528
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,384
I see what's going on.

529
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,928
Trying to date A-jung again?

530
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,430
-Well...
-We can't

531
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,307
allow that.

532
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,352
A-jung suffered so much because of you.

533
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,354
Even while she was seeing you,

534
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,439
and more so after you broke up.

535
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,275
I know.

536
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,777
-You know?
-That's why

537
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,240
I'm going to make her happier from now on.

538
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,788
He's her boyfriend.

539
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,083
-What?
-He's A-jung's boyfriend.

540
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,133
No way. I never heard that.

541
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,093
Because it's a secret.

542
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,180
It wouldn't be a secret if you knew.

543
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,142
It's pretty serious,

544
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,271
so don't confuse her
when she's finally settling down.

545
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,858
I understand
that you don't like me, but still...

546
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:36,862
I mean...

547
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,531
Still...

548
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,091
Where are you going?

549
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,350
What's with him?

550
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,235
I told you I'm not doing
any more blind dates.

551
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,071
Exactly. Why not?

552
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,906
Are you still not over Ji-han?

553
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,991
Father! It's not that...

554
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,493
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

555
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,495
-Then why?
-Forget it.

556
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,289
Anyway, this blind date
is really the last one.

557
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,084
I'm not doing this anymore, okay?

558
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,003
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

559
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:45,889
Who are you?

560
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,683
You're Yoon Chae-won, right?

561
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,143
I asked who you are.

562
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:51,812
I'm Bin Tae-hwan.

563
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,690
I'm the director of TY Construction.

564
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,694
Age 34, 180cm tall, and 70kg.

565
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,114
I don't have hobbies,
but I'm good at most things.

566
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,409
I'm sorry, but I wasn't
informed of a blind date with you.

567
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,288
Right. I think you hung up
without hearing your father out.

568
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,209
We bumped into each other at the lobby.

569
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,545
Father! It's not that...

570
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,755
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

571
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,966
Forget it. Anyway...

572
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,178
Isn't it fate?

573
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,264
How did you recognize me, though?

574
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,391
I'm probably

575
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,102
your next next blind date.

576
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,020
This Friday.

577
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,273
But you won't do it anymore.

578
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:40,235
I missed my chance a year ago,
so I couldn't miss it again.

579
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,820
I should seize my moment.

580
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,697
So, you eavesdropped on me?

581
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,199
I just overheard. Is that bad?

582
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,617
It's critical.

583
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,578
Let me make it up to you.

584
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,289
You won't get that chance.
I'm leaving now.

585
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,388
JI-HAN

586
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,694
I came out here
only to have drinks with you.

587
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,488
You liked drinking with me.

588
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,532
You said I made everything seem special.

589
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:31,411
And do you also remember when I said that?

590
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,288
It was ages ago.

591
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,415
Wow, unbelievable.

592
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,919
How could your heart change
in such a short time?

593
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,178
A-jung has a boyfriend.

594
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,554
So this was it?

595
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,015
Asking for business advice was an excuse.

596
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,939
I used to have a crush on you.
Don't you think this isn't right?

597
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,441
Make some friends, Ji-han!

598
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:02,901
No,

599
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,820
I can't trust anyone now.

600
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:10,617
Hey, slow down!

601
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:13,120
Great work today!

602
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,663
-Great work.
-Cheers.

603
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,376
Well, you might need it.

604
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,546
It could suddenly rain.
Then you'll blame me.

605
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,965
I came to talk to you as well.

606
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,468
We didn't talk honestly last time.

607
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,144
Your manager called this morning,
saying you weren't coming out.

608
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,896
You didn't come with Ji-han, did you?

609
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,357
Nonsense.

610
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,277
You're at it again.

611
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,529
You'd better not be waiting for him!

612
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,408
I get that you're getting wavered
by your ex,

613
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,326
but you shouldn't, A-jung.

614
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,370
It's not that.

615
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,081
We knew it, so we told him.

616
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,709
-What?
-We told him everything.

617
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,545
So, told him what?

618
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,054
Are you crazy?

619
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,599
Why would you tell him that?

620
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,019
It seemed like he wanted to see you again.

621
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,020
Right?

622
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,025
Hello?

623
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,154
What?

624
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,617
Wow. You went to have a drink
after you left?

625
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,535
With your first love?

626
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,412
Sorry about this,

627
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,039
but please take him.

628
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,957
I can't handle him.

629
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,961
No, I don't want to handle him either.

630
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,382
Why are you giving him to me?
You could've called Do-han.

631
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,093
You take him.

632
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,805
You wanted him!

633
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,059
You wanted him too, you know.

634
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,852
Take him.

635
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:06,650
-Ji-han.
-What?

636
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,151
You choose.

637
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,486
Is it me or A-jung?

638
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,365
Choose wisely.

639
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,496
A-jung!

640
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,833
I told you to choose wisely.

641
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,252
You idiot.

642
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,337
Good luck, then. Bye.

643
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,880
You're really leaving?

644
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:30,715
Come on, Ms. Yoon!

645
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,050
Ms. Yoon!

646
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,636
I like you the most!

647
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,764
Why did you choose me?

648
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,433
You're so annoying.

649
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,893
Why? Come on.

650
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,355
Life is so boring.

651
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,251
It really is you.

652
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,545
We meet again.

653
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,714
I take back what I said.

654
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,424
What?

655
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,260
How did you recognize me from behind?

656
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,722
Well, I've had a crush on you for a while.

657
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,849
Oh, for three hours?

658
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,727
No, since your wedding.

659
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,272
I was the groom's guest.

660
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,566
So I asked for a blind date with you.

661
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,652
I'm sorry if I upset you at the hotel,

662
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,612
but I was completely sincere.

663
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:38,867
That's not the problem. You fell in love
with someone else's bride?

664
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,744
Love comes before friendship.

665
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,497
Is that immoral? Is that bad too?

666
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,417
Yes. Critical again.

667
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,920
But I didn't act.
Why don't you focus on my self-control?

668
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,966
Or how the bride was much too pretty.

669
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,264
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

670
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,641
That won't make up for it.

671
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,602
No, I purely want to help.

672
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,813
Am I making up for it?

673
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:35,215
Are you taking revenge on me

674
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,050
for getting drunk a few times?

675
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,136
Stay down!

676
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,224
You yelled at me.

677
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,059
So mean.

678
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:54,317
Let me ask you something.

679
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,945
How...

680
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,407
How can love change so easily?

681
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,244
I remained faithful and loyal to you,

682
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,621
thinking about you every day.

683
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,039
Don't be ridiculous.

684
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,292
You didn't even know the role I played.

685
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,669
You really think so?

686
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,421
I'm not stupid.

687
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,131
I can remember everything.

688
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,508
I watched that show so many times.

689
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,301
I memorized all the lines.

690
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:21,636
Really?

691
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:30,562
Break up

692
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,189
with that guy.

693
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,109
A guy who dumps you

694
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,195
right after passing his exam
to date another girl

695
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:42,657
is a douchebag
you shouldn't waste your time on. Okay?

696
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,452
You shouldn't even stay close to him.

697
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,620
I guess it's true.

698
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,456
Do you know how much it hurt

699
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,958
when you cried after the breakup?

700
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,835
But that's just a character.

701
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,670
It's not just a character.

702
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,213
Okay?

703
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,299
When you watch that guy act

704
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,343
you can see how easily he plays his role.

705
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,347
It means he has a lot in common
with the character. It's dangerous.

706
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,307
A-jung.

707
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,059
Break up with him.

708
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,395
Break up, please?

709
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:13,730
Break up.

710
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,315
Break up with him.

711
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,989
It feels like I've gone back in time.

712
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,248
Break up.

713
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,001
He's dangerous.

714
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,472
Where's Ji-han?

715
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,058
Is he late or is he not coming?

716
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,645
Ji-han had some business,
so he can't come today.

717
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,272
Him? Business?

718
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:00,151
-And you?
-Thanks to you, I can't do anything.

719
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,865
By the way, it's been a while, Do-han.

720
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:09,077
We didn't expect you
to come for an exhibit.

721
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,037
Life is crazy, right?

722
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,205
If it were me,

723
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,123
-I'd stay hidden--
-That's enough.

724
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:18,294
Hey. You're spitting everywhere.
Keep your mouth shut.

725
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,129
How can I eat then?

726
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,214
Then don't eat.

727
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:26,719
Eat.

728
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,304
Eat.

729
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,056
Eat. You can eat.

730
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,183
So,

731
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,477
how's the preparation going?

732
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,479
Any reporters bothering you?

733
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,941
It's fine. I'll take care of it myself.

734
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,777
All right.

735
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,530
I'm sure you'll do fine on your own.

736
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:49,075
Oh, right. I got carp juice made for you,

737
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,619
so drink some every morning, okay?

738
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:56,124
You need good stamina for the exhibit.
You're young, but you still need it.

739
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,002
What?

740
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,130
There's some for you too!

741
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,799
And for Seung-a and Se-jin.

742
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,301
Take some home.

743
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:08,720
I caught them.

744
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,430
All right?

745
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,806
CARP JUICE

746
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,199
I heard

747
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:32,744
about your exhibit.

748
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,872
Are you back for good?

749
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,375
No, just for a while.

750
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,130
What brought you here?

751
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,927
I thought I should tell you

752
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,306
that I'm sorry.

753
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,768
I made you suffer so much

754
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,686
to get back at you.

755
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,939
It was sort of my fault

756
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,068
that you had to come out.

757
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,489
You don't have to be sorry.

758
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,824
I chose to do it.

759
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,911
I was a coward back then.

760
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,830
Always running away and hiding.

761
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,917
So let's not

762
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,670
feel guilty toward each other anymore.

763
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:26,839
Okay.

764
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,051
Good luck with the exhibit.

765
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,596
I'm not sure I can make it, though.

766
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,599
Bye.

767
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,070
You're drawing

768
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,364
the eyes now.

769
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,243
Yes, I'm not scared anymore.

770
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,705
I'm trying out the things

771
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,707
I used to be afraid of.

772
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,836
Why are you pretending to be dead?

773
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,339
Come back to life.

774
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,759
There's some pollock soup.

775
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:54,635
You didn't go.

776
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,720
I was too tired.

777
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:57,847
Come out.

778
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:08,941
You made this?

779
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:09,942
If I did?

780
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,652
I really might die.

781
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,073
Do-han made it.

782
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,996
-Happy?
-Yes.

783
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,461
Don't worry, I won't tease you.

784
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,671
You were just drunk.

785
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:33,382
-I understand.
-Right.

786
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,719
How can love change so easily?

787
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,475
You can want to ask
a philosophical question.

788
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,727
What is faith and loyalty?

789
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:48,481
You can also want to discuss
ethical topics, right?

790
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,757
I'll go in, then.

791
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,425
Bye.

792
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:18,970
Wait, A-jung.

793
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,098
I really meant

794
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,809
what I said last night.

795
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,396
-I really--
-Hey!

796
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,231
Stop right there.

797
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,990
I caught you red-handed.
I knew something was fishy.

798
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,201
I told you. This car was here

799
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,078
since two days ago.

800
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,454
Two days ago?

801
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,558
Why were you there with A-jung

802
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,603
in front of our house?

803
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,230
Explain it to us.

804
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:15,484
You'd better give
a pretty good explanation for this.

805
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:16,861
I told you,

806
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,572
-it's not like that.
-Quiet.

807
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,574
It's not what you think!

808
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:22,575
It is.

809
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,078
Hey, Ji-han.

810
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,165
What are you talking about? It's not.

811
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,960
Do you even know what you're saying?

812
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,296
Hello?

813
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,964
I don't know about A-jung,

814
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,759
but I like her.

815
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:41,344
No,

816
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:44,931
I love her.

817
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,101
What?

818
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,688
I know it would seem weird

819
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:54,815
for me to say this

820
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,735
after a whole year.

821
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,696
You can curse at me

822
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,157
or hit me all you want.

823
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,701
But even if I'm beat to death,

824
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:08,788
I can't give up my feelings.

825
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:11,707
I...

826
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,627
can't live without A-jung.

827
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,129
Good heavens.

828
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,675
Then why did you cause such a huge scandal

829
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,052
with that press conference

830
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,930
and abandon her for a year?

831
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:29,558
Back then,

832
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:34,355
I thought it'd be best
for us to keep a distance.

833
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,859
That we'd forget each other

834
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,612
and time would...

835
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:44,448
heal everything.

836
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:47,785
But now I know

837
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,122
how arrogant and foolish

838
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,457
that decision was.

839
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,046
So I won't make that mistake again.

840
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,175
It's late, but I'll do my best.

841
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,222
This is getting pretty obvious.

842
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,268
He's going to ask them
for her hand in marriage.

843
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:13,310
Exactly.

844
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,438
Mother, Father,

845
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,939
I'll give myself to you.

846
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,442
-Please take me in.
-What...

847
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,527
Ji-han.

848
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,405
Wow, he's a tough opponent.

849
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,115
We will not.

850
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,827
And we've already taken in

851
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,163
one son-in-law.

852
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,999
Tae-min was enough for us.

853
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:38,210
I didn't mean right away.

854
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,547
I'll put in my best efforts.

855
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,049
I'll do my best, Father.

856
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:52,349
You seemed to be preparing a meal.
How can I help?

857
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,185
-No, wait...
-Should I get the rice?

858
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,062
-No! We...
-Then the soup?

859
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,147
-No, wait.
-Okay.

860
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,565
-This way.
-All right.

861
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,779
-No, get that.
-The rice is over there.

862
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,240
We have an extra hand to help us now.

863
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,534
This is great.

864
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,606
You should've just left.

865
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:43,901
Why did you stay to eat?

866
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,320
You got an upset stomach.

867
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,074
I'm sorry, A-jung.

868
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,537
Your boyfriend.

869
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,040
I'm sure you're feeling bad.

870
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,798
He's not my boyfriend.

871
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,884
What?

872
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:12,346
I meant to tell you,
but I missed the right time.

873
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,725
And you were a bit cute,

874
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,521
so I wanted to keep teasing you.
All right?

875
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,359
But I didn't think you'd react like this.

876
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,695
We're even now, right?

877
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,323
What do you mean?

878
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:33,576
You saw me often

879
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,663
on TV all this time,
but I couldn't. It's unfair.

880
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,541
I couldn't see you,

881
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:44,336
so I had to hold back my longing for you.

882
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:48,716
I...

883
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,179
couldn't sleep a wink last night.

884
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,849
I missed you so much,

885
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,727
and I wanted to hug you so much.

886
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:03,898
I wondered how I lived without you.

887
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:08,736
Seeing you next to me
made me feel like I could finally breathe.

888
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,206
What is it?

889
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,211
This isn't what I had in mind.

890
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:30,216
I actually made plans.

891
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,929
I thought it'd take some time

892
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,724
for you to break up with him
and come to me,

893
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:43,729
so I was going to come up
with a cool and original proposal.

894
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,272
What are you...

895
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,399
I have no choice, then.

896
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,448
I don't want to lose you again.

897
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,285
A-jung.

898
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:00,996
Marry me.

899
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:04,917
What?

900
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,336
Let me be your husband,

901
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,633
not your brother-in-law

902
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,135
or your manager,

903
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:20,474
or a boyfriend you can
break up with anytime after a fight.

904
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:24,853
A husband

905
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:28,190
you can share a bed with
even after a fight,

906
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:34,655
a husband you can
go to see a late-night movie with,

907
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,286
a husband who can dry your hair for you

908
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:43,080
when you're sleepy in the morning,

909
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,294
a husband who can

910
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:52,631
clean up your hair on the floor all day.

911
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,594
Let me be that husband.

912
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,184
What's this?

913
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,230
Is it really a proposal?

914
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:12,276
Yes.

915
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,864
Though it's a mess since I'm anxious.

916
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,082
Even your marriage proposal is a mess.

917
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,420
How consistent.

918
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,381
My feelings will be too.

919
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,134
Aren't I trustworthy?

920
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,552
I'm not sure.

921
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,681
I'm tired of doing marriage preparations.

922
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,434
All the more reason to do it with me.

923
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,645
We already met each other's families,

924
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,481
did a family meeting,

925
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,025
and even lived together.

926
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,529
All we have to do is get married now.

927
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,785
How easy is that?

928
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,913
I'll pretend to think about it.

929
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,707
Then I'll be more persistent.

930
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,407
Do you swear to love, honor,
and cherish each other

931
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:08,535
until the end of your days?

932
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:12,789
I do.

933
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,125
I do.

934
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,012
Serves you right.

935
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,183
This is what you get
for marrying someone else.

936
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,643
What are you doing here?

937
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,102
Of course, I came

938
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,480
to oppose this marriage.

939
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,574
-What?
-What's going on?

940
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,854
It's impossible to be honest all the time.

941
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,025
Life is filled with lies...

942
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,954
to hide one's weaknesses

943
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:45,424
or one's clumsiness.

944
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:08,405
We've been acting
to become someone better.

945
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,659
Let's stop relying on someone else
and be independent!

946
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:18,081
So, will we succeed?

947
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:26,423
Yes, Aunt.

948
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:29,635
A-jung's show is airing tomorrow.

949
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,261
Yes.

950
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,014
That's right.

951
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,307
Careful, Tinkerbell.

952
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,184
Doesn't that hurt?

953
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,609
He's making me feel sick too.

954
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:49,237
What do you want to show me?

955
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,741
You've been ignoring me
since you succeeded.

956
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,412
-This.
-What?

957
01:05:57,496 --> 01:06:00,165
WEDDING IMPOSSIBLE
"MOST ANTICIPATED WEBNOVEL!"

958
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,166
What?

959
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,502
It's been published?

960
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,880
I'm your man, Su-jung!

961
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,466
I'll make you live in luxury.

962
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,718
Ji-oh, Su-jung.

963
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:13,720
Let's move out!

964
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,396
You know,

965
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,439
I'm thinking of retiring too.

966
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:26,608
Why?

967
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,945
To follow me around?
Aren't you tired of it?

968
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:31,613
My gosh.

969
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,824
-Just drink.
-Oh, okay.

970
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,326
You're still young.

971
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:38,620
It's all right.

972
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,580
Let me get some rest.

973
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,293
You look so much better than before.

974
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:46,670
But I know now...

975
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,465
that whatever I look like,

976
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,175
whatever situation I'm in,

977
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:56,346
I have you by my side.

978
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,810
That I can be my true self with you.

979
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:06,606
I'm never

980
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,775
letting go of you now.

981
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,236
I mean, I can't.

982
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,363
I'll keep holding onto you.

983
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,541
And I also love you

984
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,043
for that.

985
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,548
I love you just as you are.

986
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,470
