1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,770
   
   

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,870
   
   

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,300
   

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,140
   

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,850
     

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,250
   

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,120
   

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,470
   

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,890
   

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,340
   

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,930
- You know... 
 - Hey...

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,040


13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,420
- About earlier— 
 - About earlier—

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,370
I hit you too hard, didn't I?

15
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,330
I think I did without even realizing it.

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,870
No, not at all. T-That's not it.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,060
It's not that I was trying intentionally, but—

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,180
Oh, y-yes, I know it wasn't the case.

19
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,940
- You're okay, right— 
 - The kiss.

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,470
The kiss we had earlier.

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,750
Your feelings are the same as mine. Right?

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,450
They are.

23
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,800
They're the same, but...

24
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,240
what do we do now?

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,240
And what about Do Han?

26
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,030
For now, why don't we focus on the two of us?

27
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,280
Until the moment I called you up...

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,830
Even when I confessed my feelings,

29
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,640
I actually couldn't even imagine we'd end up like this.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,780
I feel the same way.

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,100
It's the same for me.

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,090
But my head's way too cluttered right now.

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,080
We went through so much to get here.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,220
So we can't afford to get lost in our worries.

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,650
Just for one day, no less or more,

36
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,840
let's focus on each other.

37
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,560
Just trust me and follow me from now on.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,150
♫  When I quietly look into your smile  ♫

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,700
♫  Without realizing, I end up smiling along with you  ♫

40
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,700
I'd like two tickets for the bus that's leaving right now.

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,480
Where are you headed?

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,600
Just the furthest destination from here.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,810
 Thank you. 

44
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,980
♫  If you feel the same way I do, could you say so?  ♫

45
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,710
♫  I want to know everything about you  ♫

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,950
♫  You entered my heart without me realizing  ♫

47
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,940
♫  And hotter than the sunlight in midday  ♫

48
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,720
♫  You filled me with warmth  ♫

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,260
♫  Even when I close my eyes, I can see you clearly  ♫

50
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,490
♫  I can't describe it all with words  ♫

51
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,380
♫  My feelings grew so big they'll explode  ♫

52
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,480
♫  Until they reach you, I'll come to you little by little  ♫

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,990
♫  Our love has already begun  ♫

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,210
 You do it every single time. 

55
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,730
 When you're about to get married, 

56
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,900
 when you were leaving five years ago, and when Mother passed away, too. 

57
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,160
 You selfish bastard. 

58
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,220
 I pretended not to know and endured every time. 

59
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,020
 "I must've not been credible." 

60
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,540
 I was actually sorry. 

61
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,330
   

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,660
 Please... 

63
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,780
 stop thinking about how you'll be hurt and... 

64
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,380
 think about how others would get hurt. 

65
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,660
   

66
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,370
   

67
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,290
We really came.

68
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,570
Of course, we really came.

69
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,820
And I think we came to the right place.

70
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,530
Isn't it so beautiful?

71
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,910
It's definitely different than waiting for the first bus after drinking.

72
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,420
Your sensibility is really something else.

73
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm an actress, am I not?

74
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,440
By the way, since we're on the topic, shall we go hit some hangover soup?

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,260
Let's not get carried away here.

76
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,090
How can you say to go and hit some hangover soup in this situation?

77
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,230
What's more, you want to go "hit" some, not go "eat" some?

78
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,050
So, you don't want to?

79
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,750
How could I?

80
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,680
I'd be happy even if you were to hit me, not the hangover soup.

81
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,520
Being here with you like this, Na A Jeong...

82
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,370
It really feels like a dream.

83
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,220
Well, okay.

84
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,770
Let's clarify things once more.

85
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,950
For the next 24 hours, we'll not hide anything or try to read the other person's thoughts.

86
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,980
We just need to focus on each other and do what we want to do.

87
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,700
We came here as Male One and Female One.

88
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,120
No one knows us, and we don't know anyone here. Okay?

89
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,780
Sorry?

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,660
Oh, okay. Should we just say we have never met before, too?

91
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,900
I think that'd be more comfortable.

92
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,100
Nice to meet you.

93
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,780
My name is Lee Ji Heon.

94
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,190
I came to hang out in a nearby neighborhood,

95
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,320
and I fell for you at first sight. Do you want to go out with me?

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,460
Isn't this method way too cliché?

97
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,170
The method might be cliché, but I'm sure my looks are refreshing.

98
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,050
I'm sure it makes you want to get involved with me very much.

99
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,570
I can tell the process of getting involved will be quite dreadful.

100
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,150
But where are we going?

101
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,580
Let's go hit some hangover soup.

102
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,570
This is beyond hitting it. You conquered it.

103
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,610
You see, I never lose.

104
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,140
If you want to date me, please keep that in mind.

105
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,930
Did you say your name's Neo A Jeong?

106
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,490
Yes.

107
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,930
Lee Ji Heon.

108
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,040
Do you want anything else?

109
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,770
Like boiled pork or blood sausages.

110
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,460
We need to go to other places, too.

111
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,290
We need to save some room for snacks.

112
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,710
You're thorough.

113
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,340
By the way, you know what I like even though we've just met.

114
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,540
It's almost suspicious since earlier.

115
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,520
No need to get suspicious.

116
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,500
Your ideal type of man even has the same taste as you.

117
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,020
Just consider it fate, then.

118
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,740
I never said you were my type.

119
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,940
I've never failed to be someone's ideal type.

120
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,660
Am I wrong?

121
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,550
You're right.

122
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,670
What's this now?

123
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,770
Why? You said you were from the neighborhood next door.

124
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,440
You should dress to fit the theme.

125
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,190
The theme is just an excuse. You're having too much fun.

126
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,800
An excuse?

127
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,260
One's style is very important for the character expression.

128
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,880
It helps with how much you get into it.

129
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,500
In that case, Lee Ji Heon,

130
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,880
you should try this on.

131
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
It sure does get you into the theme.

132
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,000
I should pick mine out.

133
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,080
I'm going to...

134
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,910
This one or this one.

135
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,410
Which one's better?

136
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,360
They're both pretty.

137
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,890
Just buy both.

138
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,990
Actually, buy everything here.

139
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,600
- Boss! 
 - Yes.

140
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,590
Give me everything from here to here.

141
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,170
No, forget that. I can just try these on. Right?

142
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,510
- Yes, go ahead. 
 - Thank you.

143
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,310
What's the use of changing the theme?

144
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,110
You're a third-generation conglomerate to the bone.

145
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,630
I know you've got money, but hold your horses for a moment.

146
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,090
I'm going to go try these on.

147
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,800
Not so bad.

148
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,590
Very pretty.

149
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,370
Let's go.

150
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,150
♫  What's this? This feeling is unfamiliar and awkward  ♫

151
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,340
It's the marketplace.

152
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,310
Should we buy a hat?

153
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,500
Looks great on you.

154
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,940
♫  Should we grab some food, too?  ♫

155
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,850
♫  What else should we do?  ♫

156
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,530
How do I look?

157
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,630
♫  Am I just a good friend to you?  ♫

158
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,220
♫  It's so frustrating, I can't hold it in, I want to know you  ♫

159
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,230
♫  Tell me, tell me your feelings  ♫

160
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,220
♫  Put a label on our relationship  ♫

161
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,680
♫  I wonder if you know how I feel  ♫

162
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,280
♫  Can't wait no more  ♫

163
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,170
♫  Choose, choose, how you really feel  ♫

177
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,690
Where have you been all this time?

178
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,880
Why didn't you answer me?

179
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,330
You're the one who told Ji Han. Right?

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,270
What the heck were you thinking to tell him such—

181
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,170
I don't think that's what you need to worry about.

182
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,680
What?

183
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,990
A reporter had come to me.

184
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,790
   

185
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,210
You even told this person, too?

186
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,420
You said this won't be the end. Just how far will you take this?

187
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,880
That depends on what you do.

188
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,780
I'll only go as far as you go.

189
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,940
Hey, Jeong Dae Hyeon.

190
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,400
You keep claiming to be the victim, saying I crossed the line or something.

191
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,860
- But what are you so upset about? 
 - Well, usually...

192
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,390
people feel injustice when they get blamed for something they didn't do.

193
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,450
For example, stuff like the pictures and the electricity.

194
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,780
Today, as well.

195
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,010
   

196
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,560
 So what do you want from me? 

197
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,250
 What exactly is the relationship between Lee Do Han and Na A Jeong? 

198
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,230
 It seems they used to be quite close. 

199
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,560
 Used to be quite close? 

200
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,310
 "Used to be quite close" and "being quite close" are different. 

201
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:08,100
 People who used to be quite close can't help but feel sick of each other. 

202
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,950
 Also, in my experience, more people are closer to money. 

203
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,540
 I'll mask your identity and compensate you adequately. 

204
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,460
 So I just need you to cooperate. 

205
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,550
 I refuse. 

206
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,200
 What? 

207
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,740
 I don't want to. 

208
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,520
I said that the reporter had come to me. I didn't say I told him anything.

209
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,670
I didn't say I told him, yet you cornered me so much.

210
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,660
Jeong Dae Hyeon, I don't trust you anymore.

211
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm sure you told me about this in the first place to torment me.

212
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,030
Not sure.

213
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,340
It could be trying to tell you to be careful or something.

214
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,940
You would? At this point?

215
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,120
People who used to be quite close

216
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,360
might not be left with only the feeling of being sick of each other.

217
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
I think that's the case for me, though.

218
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,620
No matter how much I think about it, you're the one I should be most wary of.

219
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,150
Is this right?

220
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,550
The things you're doing right now.

221
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,870
You're afraid of yourself being found out,

222
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,160
so you're forcing yourself to marry someone you're not in love with

223
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,770
and being on the run all the time, anxious your secret might be exposed at any given point.

224
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,400
Is this really right?

225
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,460
Gosh, I love this place.

226
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,150
Should we just come down and live here?

227
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,340
What do you think about that big house over there?

228
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,460
I'd rather live in that house.

229
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,060
It's got a garden.

230
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,890
I can plant flowers and vegetables.

231
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,020
H-Hey, young man, please give me a hand.

232
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,210
Me?

233
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,810
What's wrong, ma'am?

234
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,670
Are you hurt somewhere?

235
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,860
I sprained my back a while ago.

236
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,430
I managed to bring the fertilizer, but...

237
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,860
Oh, is that so?

238
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,570
- We'll help you out. 
 - Gosh, okay.

239
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,070
You don't need to go this far to help.

240
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,520
Gosh, this isn't anything hard.

241
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,060
You can just take a break, ma'am.

242
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
You're such a pretty young lady and a good worker, too.

243
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,800
I had learned so many things just in case.

244
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,330
One time, I harvested sweet potatoes all day to learn how to farm.

245
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,360
Goodness, I'm proud of you.

246
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,500
If you're done there, come here and pull out the weeds with me!

247
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,380
Okay!

248
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,610
Let me see it.

249
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,620
The scythe looks old. I won't get tetanus. Right?

250
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,480
You're such a wimp.

251
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,080
If you tell yourself it wasn't a deep cut, this will heal on its own.

252
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,550
I think it'll get better if you blow on it.

253
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,070
Happy?

254
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,350
Where are you going?

255
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,160
It still hurts, Na A Jeong.

256
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,300
I feel much better.

257
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,750
You didn't even do much work.

258
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,810
Don't you see my scar of honor?

259
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,040
All right. Did you both enjoy the meal?

260
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,340
Ma'am, you're such a good cook.

261
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,830
We really loved the food.

262
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,090
I'm so glad.

263
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,500
You can spend the night here if you don't have a place to sleep

264
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,980
since it's already so late.

265
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,390
I'll give you a big discount!

266
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,510
I didn't think there'd be only one room.

267
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,370
It's an obvious turn of events.

268
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,630
It's more like a rule, I guess?

269
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,690
If you come to an island, the ferries shut down.

270
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,570
If you go to the backcountry, the buses shut down.

271
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,870
When you find a place to spend the night, there's always only one room like this.

272
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,590
Stuff like this is just so cliché. It doesn't bother me at all.

273
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,380
Lee Ji Han, are you okay?

274
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,400
What do you mean?

275
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,270
- Are you worried about me right now? 
 - I can't help it. Why?

276
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,500
Lee Ji Han, how should I say this? You look very nervous right now.

277
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,390
I'm not. I'm totally fine.

278
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,750
And why shouldn't I feel fine?

279
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,320
We stayed in the same room in Busan, too.

280
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,540
Also, we slept just fine under one roof the past few days.

281
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,670
So, you're telling me you couldn't find out about that man. Right?

282
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,250
Reporter Kang, you love eating raw food too much. 
  (Also means to gain something for free) 

283
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,720
You'll get a stomachache one day.

284
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,630
What's this now?

285
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,880
Take a look at it first.

286
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,000
What the heck is this?

287
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,300
While I was looking into that man, I had my junior follow those two.

288
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,010
Yes!  This is what I'm talking about!

289
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,280
The clear evidence I told you about!

290
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Why are you giving me this now?

291
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,990
I almost got disappointed, Reporter Kang.

292
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,610
Managing Director Choi, you're sure you'll keep your promise. Right?

293
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,600
The truth behind your mother's accident.

294
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,740
Of course.

295
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,690
I've already been securing the witnesses and the CCTV footage from back then.

296
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,350
This is a funny turn of events.

297
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,700
The room is nice and cozy.

298
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,480
Are you sleeping?

299
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,270
Are you really sleeping?

300
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,750
Na A Jeong. N-Na A Jeong.

301
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm not sleeping!

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,800
I'm not sleeping, so stop calling me!

303
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,740
You would've woke me up even if I had fallen asleep.

304
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,900
When you're not calling me, you keep gulping and tossing around.

305
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,950
When did I do that? You're so weird.

306
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,950
You can just answer me if you're not sleeping.

307
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,960
Does it really hurt that much?

308
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,250
The bleeding stopped, and the wound will close up soon, too.

309
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,970
Aren't you being too careless just because it's not you?

310
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,510
It really hurts.

311
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,240
Were you always such a baby?

312
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,070
Only with certain people.

313
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,910
Then, save it for tomorrow and sleep tonight.

314
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm dying from walking around all day.

315
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,970
Goodnight.

316
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,870
Goodnight.

317
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,720
Why aren't you sleeping?

318
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,850
You woke up?

319
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,860
I just couldn't fall asleep.

320
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,150
Why?

321
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,050
Because we're going back tomorrow?

322
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,550
I wish one day wasn't 24 hours long,

323
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,240
but 48 or 72 hours long.

324
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,950
Do you like being with me that much?

325
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,950
I wonder why I couldn't catch on when you like me this much.

326
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,420
By the way,

327
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,660
when did you start liking me?

328
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,900
Rather, how did you end up liking me?

329
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,580
I told you.

330
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,190
I fell for you while trying to make you fall for me.

331
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,430
When I came to my senses, I already had feelings for you.

332
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,760
I was so startled.

333
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,350
It was so bad that I even fell ill.

334
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
That was the same for me.

335
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,150
I did all sorts of things to get rid of those feelings.

336
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:44,500
I even believed the superstition about Deoksugung's Stone-Wall Road.

337
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,900
Deoksugung's Stone-Wall Road?

338
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,800
Oh, when we had the family introduction meeting?

339
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,100
The paper cranes.

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,300
Those paper cranes, too?

341
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,910
They were!

342
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,080
Gosh, Lee Ji Han, you tried so hard.

343
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,580
Since when did you like me, Na A Jeong?

344
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,420
I first realized something was off...

345
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,910
at the Deoksugung's Stone-Wall Road.

346
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,400
You finally said you'd acknowledge Do Han and me, but

347
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,010
I felt empty inside.

348
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,590
The tooth that was aching finally came loose,

349
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,380
but it only felt empty and

350
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,630
it felt like wind was gushing in through the hole.

351
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,950
But you grabbed my hand at the wedding dress shop and ran away.

352
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,110
I got really mad at you back then. Right?

353
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,210
But I was actually happy.

354
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,320
I clearly had to get married to Do Han,

355
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,670
but my feelings kept going the other way.

356
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,100
I was on my toes all alone, unable to do this or that.

357
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,070
But you showed up out of nowhere and brought me out of that situation.

358
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,390
I was thankful.

359
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,460
What do you think...

360
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,190
would've happened if you met me before my brother?

361
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,700
Instead of Brother's younger brother, Lee Ji Han, and

362
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,280
Brother's lover, Na A Jeong.

363
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,160
It'd have been great if we had met...

364
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,000
as a man and a woman like now.

365
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,830
That would've been really great.

366
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,310
We have no choice but to run into many obstacles going forward.

367
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,400
It'll be difficult and exhausting.

368
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100
But let's still...

369
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,000
continue to stay together.

370
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,820
Let's not hide our feelings

371
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,880
and put on an act,

372
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,300
ever again.

373
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,920
I plan to announce the off-season performance assessment you asked for tomorrow.

374
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,120
Yes, I got it.

375
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,910
So, did Do Han agree to take over the company?

376
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,330
What can he do if I just force it into his hands?

377
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,770
He'll figure something out.

378
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,230
It's not like I didn't let him know in advance.

379
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,250
In any case,

380
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,880
the new position they want Ji Han to take,

381
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,100
what's your opinion?

382
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,240
He'll be reliable since he was in charge of the LJ shopping mall promotion.

383
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,360
Above all, he has a good reputation at Taeyang Corporation, our partner company.

384
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
- Really? 
 - Yes.

385
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,130
I'm sure it's thanks to Chae Won.

386
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,060
Anyhow, now is the perfect time. Correct?

387
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,430
A day is too short.

388
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,650
I know.

389
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,520
It feels like a dream.

390
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
What a shame.

391
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,120
I'll break the news to Do Han.

392
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,970
Why would you? I should tell him.

393
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,400
But still, it's about ending my relationship with Do Han.

394
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,600
- I should do it. 
 - You can't.

395
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,980
Our news is one thing but before that,

396
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,700
I really need to talk with Bro.

397
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,390
We still haven't made up after the fight that day.

398
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,920
It might sound ridiculous for me to say this in this situation.

399
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,630
But Brother is more than a brother to me.

400
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,960
I don't want Brother to get hurt.

401
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,050
I know it bothers you, Na A Jeong.

402
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,700
But can you...

403
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,300
just for once...

404
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,010
trust me and give me some time?

405
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,800
I don't think it'll take too long.

406
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
I understand.

407
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,400
I'll wait for you.

408
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,330
I'll tell Brother and let you know.

409
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,720
Okay.

410
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,180
- Go inside. 
 - Only if you go first.

411
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,340
What's all this?

412
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,920
You can say they're my offerings for you, Ji Ae.

413
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,040
I made them myself. They're 100% handmade.

414
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,120
Amazing, Unni, it's a five-tier lunch box.

415
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,970
I know. It's a five-tier lunch box. Why are you giving this to me?

416
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,950
You should just give it to A Jeong.

417
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,250
Oh, that has nothing to do with me at all. They were 100% made by someone else.

418
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,320
He's right, Unni. He must've worked hard to make this.

419
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,730
Just look at him. He looks so gaunt already.

420
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,930
That's Jong Hee for you. Thank you for recognizing my effort. What a good person.

421
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,310
Looks like the two of you became really close, huh?

422
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,980
You're even on a first-name basis now.

423
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,070
I'm going to the restroom.

424
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,380
Is this what you mentioned last time?

425
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,610
Yes! It is.

426
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,180
Give me your account number, and I'll wire you the money.

427
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,730
It's a 30% discounted price. ight?

428
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,250
Yes.

429
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,760
Gosh, you packed a great lunch.

430
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,870
Miss, I'd like you to stop eating this now, by the way.

431
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,690
- What? 
 - It’s a very precious thing that isn’t available to many. It's for my Ji Ae.

432
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,400
Okay.

433
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,980
You can eat this. There's a lot of this one.

434
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,730
What the heck is this?

435
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,300
Is it Jong Hee this time?

436
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,510
Ji Ae! Ji Ae!

437
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,010
Where are you going without eating your lunch?

438
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,090
Forget it. You can just go.

439
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,910
- Ji Ae. 
 - My goodness!

440
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,050
Just stop bothering me already!

441
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,840
Ji Ae, you're really cruel.

442
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,830
Don't you actually know everything?

443
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,090
I just haven't confessed my feelings,

444
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,240
but you know I like you, Ji Ae.

445
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,570
So why won't you confess?

446
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,990
Because I'll be rejected if I do.

447
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,390
And it's better to be by your side than not see you.

448
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,430
Then, why would you keep hitting on A Jeong and Jong Hee?

449
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,400
How many times do I have to tell you?

450
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,300
Na A Jeong really has nothing to do with me, and I contacted Jong Hee because...

451
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,270
I wanted to know more about you.

452
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,930
I can swear by you, Ji Ae.

453
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,870
Why would you swear by me?

454
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,240
What more am I supposed to do for you in this situation, Ji Ae?

455
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
There's no need to do more for me.

456
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,230
Just do less for other people!

457
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,000
- Sorry? 
 - It makes me jealous!

458
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,600
I also have feelings for you!

459
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,650
Yes, Ji Han.

460
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,190
 Brother. 

461
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,510
You weren't home. Are you at the studio?

462
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,700
 Yes, I'll be here for a while. 

463
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,860
I think I'll have to organize my thoughts alone.

464
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,340
Things are kind of complicated for me...

465
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,350
these days. 
    

466
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,240
There's nothing wrong. Right?

467
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,650
 Not at all. 

468
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,790
And never mind me,

469
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,770
I think you'll need some time, too.

470
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,650
I'll call you again when I'm done sorting things out.

471
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,360
Let's wrap up our talk we couldn't finish.

472
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm ready any time.

473
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,450
Let me know when you're okay.

474
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,990
I also have something to tell you.

475
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,860
Yes. I always feel bad for you.

476
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,000
Ji Ae's such a bold person.

477
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,710
"It makes me jealous! I have feelings for you, too!"

478
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,970
I miss her. I'll get off work as soon as I can!

479
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,360
Jeong Soo, what is it?

480
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,120
Team Leader, the guerilla personnel transfer announcement is up.

481
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,480
Did you know about this?

482
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,550
   
   

483
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,020
    
 Ji Han as the team leader?

484
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,520
How can there be such a sudden personnel transfer without any warning?

485
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,750
Wow. It really is a crazy promotion, though.

486
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,650
Ji Han, congrats. I knew you'd make it when you worked so hard!

487
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,640
Then, are we on different teams with Ji Han?

488
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,380
Huh? That's true.

489
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,310
 Brother, here you go again... 

490
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,040
   
   

491
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,910
You've done great work so far.

492
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,650
Yes, thank you, Chairman.

493
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,830
Oh, right.

494
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,830
Let's grab some food with Grandpa sometime soon.

495
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,290
Grandfather?

496
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,130
G-Grandfather—

497
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,320
I-I didn't hear that wrong just now. Right?

498
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,380
Grandpa?

499
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,990
Ji Han.

500
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,940
Congratulations.

501
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,330
What the heck happened just now?

502
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,620
Let me explain what the heck's happened just now.

503
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,220
At a public place where everyone's watching...

504
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:41,200
"Oh, let's grab some food with Grandpa sometime soon."

505
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,920
Grandpa! Okay? "Grandpa."

506
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,820
He said you're his grandson and that you're his family!

507
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,560
He acknowledged it right there and then!

508
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,280
- Why so suddenly? 
 - It was about time.

509
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,770
You contributed so much all this time, Ji Han.

510
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,830
Oh, well, CEO Yoon, too.

511
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,820
I actually just asked Secretary Kim about it.

512
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,030
CEO Yoon and the Chairman are still keeping in contact.

513
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,600
He said you might even get married before your brother's couple.

514
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,070
So the Chairman's really happy about it, too.

515
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,170
You're pretending not to know to the end.

516
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,900
Gosh, how sly.

517
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,700
So, tell me. When did things progress so much with CEO Yoon?

518
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,500
- Without even me knowing. 
 - It's not like that.

519
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,860
If you keep this up, I'll really get upset.

520
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,930
Ji Han!

521
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,620
I'm working off-site.

522
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,720
Sly Ji Han!

523
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,820
Cunning Ji Han!

524
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,390
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

525
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,520
CEO Yoon, let me have a word with you.

526
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,500
I don't really want to right now.

527
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,640
It'll only take a moment.

528
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,050
Fine. Let's talk.

529
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,190
You finally hit me up first.

530
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,550
So, what did you want to talk about?

531
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,760
It seems Grandfather has the wrong idea about our relationship.

532
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,310
He thinks we still...

533
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,050
That's not it.

534
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,210
He thinks things are working out better than before.

535
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,030
So, I'm going to try to be honest.

536
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,070
I have feelings for Na A Jeong.

537
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,240
I'm sorry for everything.

538
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,140
I can't believe I'm actually hearing this.

539
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,520
I did tell you to be honest then, but I regret it now that I'm hearing this.

540
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,760
CEO Yoon, you'll meet someone much better than me.

541
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,740
Someone better and the man I like are different.

542
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:06,500
Ji Han, I've never failed to obtain what I wanted in life so far.

543
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,550
It'll be the same this time.

544
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:13,610
Do you honestly think you and Na A Jeong can be together?

545
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,900
What about Do Han?

546
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,000
What about everything you built up so far and other people's opinions?

547
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,250
Can you give up everything? Can you handle everything?

548
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,970
Really?

549
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,830
Can you really?

550
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,810
Yes.

551
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,570
I'm fine.

552
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,040
Would Na A Jeong be okay with that?

553
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,160
A sister-in-law who fell in love with her brother-in-law.

554
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,330
That's the label Na A Jeong will have to live with.

555
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,150
   

556
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,800
I guess he's planning to give full support to Do Han.

557
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,200
We can somehow take care of soft-hearted Do Han.

558
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,300
- But what the heck is this— 
 - Can you really take care of Do Han?

559
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,640
Of course!

560
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,370
But Lee Ji Han's different. Have you seen how his eyes glare?

561
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,140
That ambition and viciousness!

562
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,620
When he looks at us, it feels like he's saying, "Sparta!"

563
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,620
Having Ji Han get involved makes things so difficult to the max.

564
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,820
Why are you two so overreacting?

565
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,840
Miss, you should be reacting in some way.

566
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,600
How can you be so laid back?

567
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,690
Honestly, only if we hadn't fought amongst ourselves because of your slandering,

568
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,200
those two brothers from nowhere would've never made it to the top.

569
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,590
- This is all your fault! 
 - Gosh.

570
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,090
It's not my fault.

571
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,510
It's thanks to me.

572
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,940
She hasn't come to her senses.

573
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,530
Brother, stop whining and wait patiently.

574
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,110
We're in for a good show.

575
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:04,470
You see, the higher you go, the more painful the fall.

576
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,560
Forget it! What would you know? Just pay the viewing fee.

577
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,780
How dare you.

578
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,950
Oh, maybe you won't have any money?

579
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,400
You brat, seriously!

580
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,410
Gosh, seriously— Gosh!

581
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,550
Gosh, seriously. What do we do?

582
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,550
Why are you asking me? My head's about to explode!

583
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,020
Listen carefully, Honey.

584
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,010
To assess the situation objectively,

585
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,640
we've been ruled out, more or less.

586
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,740
Becoming LJ's chairman is nonsense.

587
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,080
We need to find our way to survive again.

588
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,680
Honey, you're really something else.

589
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,540
I jump up from sleep because I get so angry.

590
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,630
How can you assess the situation objectively even now?

591
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,920
It's not like I don't feel like that.

592
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,170
But at this rate, we won't even get a subsidiary company

593
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,490
and when I think we'll be spending our old age like ordinary people...

594
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,590
Gosh, I was smacked to my senses!

595
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,340
The best we can do right now is unify candidates.

596
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,310
Miss Seung Ah versus Do Han and Ji Han.

597
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,960
Which one of the two will we side with and take some of the spoils?

598
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,040
That's what matters.

599
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,200
For sure, we're not siding with Choi Seung Ah.

600
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,660
I may lack pride, but I can't side with that traitor.

601
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,470
Yes, you read my mind.

602
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,160
I can't trust her fancy talking anymore, either.

603
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,520
But Do Han and Ji Han won't just let us side with them.

604
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,990
There's always a way.

605
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,490
What is it?

606
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,250
   
 I guess he's running a bit late. 

607
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,910
 I can't go through with this marriage! 

608
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,650
Does that even make sense? Change the channel.

609
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,580
This drama isn't just ridiculous.

610
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,100
It's totally ridiculous and wrong.

611
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,410
Why? Which one is it?

612
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,880
 Sister-in-law, come out. 

613
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,150
Goodness, even if those two were the last two people alive,

614
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,320
how can a sister-in-law and a brother-in-law fall in love?

615
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,460
A Jeong, what's wrong? Do you want some water?

616
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,340
I'm fine! Keep watching.

617
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,970
 I love you, Brother-in-law. 

618
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,950
But they must be tormented, too.

619
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,250
This means the sister-in-law betrayed her husband

620
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,160
and the brother-in-law betrayed his brother.

621
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,230
Gosh, how could they deal with the guilt?

622
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,220
Honey, none of it matters, even if they had a million reasons together.

623
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,690
Of course!

624
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,640
They still might have a reason worth listening to.

625
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,810
What I'm saying is they might have their own circumstances

626
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:46,000
and a very few might be in a very legal, moral, and ethical

627
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,820
relationship, don't you think?

628
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,450
What now?

629
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,880
You were sleeping all this time, and what nonsense is she spewing while eating?

630
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,300
Anyhow, where were you all day yesterday without even a word?

631
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,940
It's obvious, isn't it?

632
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,030
I'm sure she met Do Han.

633
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:08,500
They were away from each other after being together at his house.

634
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,200
- They must've missed each other. 
 - That's not it.

635
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,930
Finish eating before you go.

636
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,110
She didn't even eat that much.

637
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,650
I'd really tell everyone it's a fake marriage only if

638
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,750
Lee Do Han's secret wasn't on the line.

639
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:19,310
Hey, over here!

640
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,780
What's this now?

641
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,610
You're crazy. What if my family sees us?

642
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:45,180
I didn't know you already finished talking with Do Han.

643
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,600
How did it go?

644
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,770
Did it go wrong?

645
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,080
That's not it.

646
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,010
I came because I missed you. I wanted to see you.

647
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,790
Liar.

648
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,080
It's true.

649
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,280
Gosh, I swear.

650
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,870
Not because of Brother.

651
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,830
Brother and I agreed to take our time to talk.

652
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,740
What is it, then?

653
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,480
I can just tell something is up.

654
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:26,160
I finally got acknowledged by my grandfather as his grandson at work.

655
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,460
And Brother is a step closer to inheriting the company.

656
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,360
Lee Ji Han, that's what you've been...

657
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,190
It's what I've been wishing for.

658
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,750
It's what I've been wishing for,

659
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,990
but I'm not all that happy about it.

660
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,580
Is it because of me?

661
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,570
I guess that's true.

662
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,610
You can't really be happy.

663
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,470
If you choose me, you'll lose everything you've built so far

664
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:06,610
and only get criticized by people.

665
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:09,370
That's not the reason.

666
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,870
I think I can really give up everything

667
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,200
as long as I have you, Na A Jeong.

668
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,340
Actually,

669
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,020
I can give everything up.

670
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,720
I'm able to do that,

671
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,080
but it might not be the case for you.

672
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,000
So, I was going to ask you.

673
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,360
Will you really be okay...

674
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,750
if that happened?

675
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,400
I'm already prepared.

676
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,180
Great.

677
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,600
That's all I need to hear.

678
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,420
 But they must be tormented, too. 

679
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,770
 This means the sister-in-law betrayed her husband 

680
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,610
 and the brother-in-law betrayed his brother. 

681
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,660
 Gosh, how could they deal with the guilt? 

682
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,140
By the way, Lee Ji Han...

683
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,560
So, what I want to say is—

684
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,050
I told you I'm really okay.

685
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,060
The worst that can happen is getting kicked out, isn't it?

686
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,200
It'd actually be better since I get a reason to freeload off of you.

687
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,350
But still...

688
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,730
Do you find this funny?

689
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,100
It's not funny,

690
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,350
but I wanted you to smile.

691
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,130
It's not funny at all.

692
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,260
Still, let's not cry.

693
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,170
I didn't tell you this to make you cry.

694
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:37,010
I told you this because I wanted to be honest with you.

695
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,950
We agreed not to hide things from each other or put up an act.

696
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Tell me everything honestly from now on, too.

697
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:55,100
♫  With a face that says you're in love with me  ♫

698
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,340
♫  You keep telling me you love me  ♫

699
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,000
♫  How could you be like that?  ♫

700
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:09,460
♫  I'll store all of your love in my heart  ♫

701
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,800
Hey, why can't I reach you?

702
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,550
Are you just not picking up my calls like I don't pick up yours?

703
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:52,320
What brings you all the way here?

704
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,310
Would I have come to ask how you were doing?

705
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,210
No news is good news.

706
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:01,180
But you brought some news, so I'm sure it's not good news.

707
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,680
Right.

708
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,310
How come you understand me better than my brother?

709
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,020
I think it's such a shame sometimes.

710
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,310
You should've worked harder and been born one of us.

711
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,710
I'm busy. Get to the point.

712
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,480
I don't want to be here even if you're free.

713
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,200
You heard about the personnel appointment. Right?

714
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,010
Congrats, first of all.

715
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,220
And then?

716
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,050
You've got my deepest sympathy.

717
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,320
As soon as you take office, an interesting thing will happen.

718
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,930
I wanted to let you know in advance.

719
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,850
I just couldn't stand to wait because I was itching to tell you.

720
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,780
What could it be?

721
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,990
Here.

722
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,680
- What's this? 
 - I came all the way here to see this reaction.

723
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,040
What the heck is this?

724
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,160
I guess you can't even see because you blacked out.

725
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,040
If it's that hard to see, you can start from the bottom.

726
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:17,570
Here. They're walking into a hotel together.

727
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:22,280
And here, she's wearing a wedding dress and running with him.

728
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,230
It's painful, right, Do Han?

729
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,930
But this is who your brother is.

730
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,410
You brothers are really great in many ways.

731
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,180
A Jeong.

732
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,640
Let's meet.

733
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,590
All right.

734
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,850
Let's be honest.

735
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,360
So, what did you need to tell me?

736
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,470
Come on, do we need a reason to see you?

737
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,290
We've got a lot of time. Let's slowly start with how you're doing.

738
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,580
But I already know how you're doing, Oppa.

739
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,900
So, you shouldn't have too much free time. Right?

740
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,400
- You should be the busiest right now. 
 - What?

741
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,600
Everyone says you've been abandoned by Chairman Hyeon.

742
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,700
To be accurate, I took a step back because of a small misunderstanding.

743
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,390
Because I'm a generous person.

744
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,170
That wasn't true, though.

745
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,310
From what I heard, it wasn't a step back but more like a stepping down.

746
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,090
Who said so? Did Choi Seung Ah say that?

747
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,760
That brat, I'm really going to—

748
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:33,970
Yes, everything you said is right, and we're aware, too.

749
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:38,830
We also know you don't really like us.

750
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,510
Because we've been making ourselves enemies of Ji Han and Do Han.

751
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,580
- However? 
 - However,

752
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,950
we're on the same side now.

753
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:55,320
Min Woong and I are going to side with Ji Han and Do Han without much greed.

754
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,640
I guess we'll soon be a happy family?

755
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,600
Yes, you're right.

756
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,700
And you know, a family is supposed to help each other when we can.

757
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,760
What's good for you is good for me. It's killing two birds with one stone.

758
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,390
Help each other, huh?

759
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,820
For starters, it's clear how I can help you both. Right?

760
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,860
For example, I can help you get a subsidiary company or something.

761
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,250
- How keen! 
 - But is there something you could help me with?

762
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,840
Of course there is!

763
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,820
Sure, you'll soon be a part of our family.

764
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,300
But you'll "soon to be" a part, literally.

765
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,240
That means you're not yet a part.

766
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,620
- But we're already a part of the family. 
 - Yes.

767
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,840
There's a limit to how much you can find out about someone else's family.

768
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,140
We'll let you in on those details.

769
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,960
I'm not sure. There isn't anything I really—

770
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,220
I think Seung Ah—

771
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:56,670
I think Seung Ah is scheming something against Ji Han.

772
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,590
You should mind your manners.

773
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,770
You should be the one since you'll be sorry.

774
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,980
- What? 
 - I must look easy to you.

775
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,580
I heard you're still close to that reporter.

776
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,310
Didn't I make my warning clear enough last time?

777
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,860
I can tell what you're talking about.

778
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,350
You're talking about Lee Ji Han and Na A Jeong. Right?

779
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,800
You know, but you're smiling?

780
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,830
I did it to smile, so why would I cry?

781
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,810
CEO Yoon, you should've listened to me, too.

782
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,550
I even showed you the picture.

783
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,010
Or could it be you still don't believe what I said?

784
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,200
There's a worse picture. Do you want to see?

785
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,730
- Unni. 
 - Huh?

786
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,710
I guess I should also show you

787
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:00,390
how Taeyang will react the moment that scandal is made public.

788
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:05,100
Would Chairman Hyeon or any of the shareholders side with you against Taeyang?

789
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,770
In my opinion, I think you'll at least be kicked out of LJ as a start.

790
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,830
Let's just keep it to words like this if you can.

791
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,110
Let's call it an end here.

792
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:21,060
It's tiring for both of us.

793
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,770
I'm leaving now.

794
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,360
Bye.

795
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,770
Lee Do Han didn't come home today, either.

796
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,860
He should sleep at home, though we're saving the talk for later.

797
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:57,850
 Things are kind of complicated for me these days. 

798
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,810
No way.

799
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,600
What an amazing timing.

800
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,030
I actually had something to tell you as well.

801
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,340
You did?

802
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,280
What is it?

803
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:32,210
Can we tell Lee Ji Han about our marriage being fake?

804
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,050
Why?

805
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,330
- It's because I— 
 - Because you like Ji Han?

806
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,340
What?

807
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,580
You do, huh?

808
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,780
Even after I had seen all the pictures, I still had my doubts.

809
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,610
Do Han.

810
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,850
Do Han, I'm sorry.

811
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,150
I know I shouldn't be doing this to you.

812
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,570
I knew that, so I did everything I could to stop myself.

813
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,200
But I couldn't really do that.

814
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,530
Since when was it?

815
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,510
Is it after Ji Han found out I like men?

816
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,890
What?

817
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,820
What did Lee Ji Han find out?

818
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,720
So, you two started...

819
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,790
when he didn't even know...

820
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,730
our marriage is fake?

821
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,110
What did you say?

822
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,330
What are you talking about?

823
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,830
What were you just talking about?

824
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,930
Your marriage is fake?

825
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,590
Lee Ji—

826
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,980
Lee Ji Han.

827
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,890
Ji Han.

828
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:45,340


829
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:51,000
♫  I fly with you, azure feelings come blowing  ♫

830
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,560
♫  What do we do? A night filled with dreams  ♫

831
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:02,720
♫  Only you and I, in all the days and scenes containing you  ♫

832
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,060
♫  Butterflies are flying around, butterflies are you and I, yeah  ♫

833
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,120
   

834
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,430
 Lee Ji Han! 

835
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,170
 I... 

836
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,430
 I can't trust you anymore, Na A Jeong. 

837
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,910
 Why won't you pick up? Why are you avoiding me? 

838
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,650
 How can you cheat on him before you even wed him? 

839
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,870
 On top of that, with your brother-in-law? 

840
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,790
 I still cherish him. 

841
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,090
 I'll do anything to protect him. 

842
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:33,210
 At least, you shouldn't sit back like this since you care about them more than I do. 

843
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,470
 The press conference is ready. 

844
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:37,840
 I'm not going to run away this time. 

845
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,830
 I'm going to protect Ji Han 

846
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:43,480
 and I'm going to protect myself. 

847
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,490
♫  Over the skyline, over the world  ♫
