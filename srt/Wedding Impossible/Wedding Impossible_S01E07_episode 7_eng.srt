1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,790
   
   

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,780
   
   

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,360
   

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,140
   

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,660
     

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,103
   

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,953
   

8
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:30,363
   

9
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:36,793
   

10
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:50,230
   

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:56,610


12
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:59,713
Let's be honest now that everything's over now.

13
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:02,853
You came to cause a scene there. Right?

14
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:06,393
I think I finally see a little bit now.

15
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:10,783
The choice that will lead me the right way.

16
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,393
The fact that I went there..

17
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:20,423
means I'll acknowledge.

18
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:33,263
Acknowledge what?

19
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:35,603
You and my brother.

20
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:47,963
So, try your best to be happy

21
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,943
with my brother.

22
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:46,663
 You know what some people say. 

23
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:52,073
 You wish for happiness with your heart, not your head. 

24
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:58,513
 But I didn't feel his heart in it at all, and it left me wondering. 

25
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:05,683
 I wondered if he actually wanted to say something else. 

26
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:34,313
But why do I feel like I'd be able to get the answer from you?

27
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,203
You're conflicted.

28
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,243
That makes me feel conflicted, too.

29
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:48,233
Should I tell Ji Ae you're a spy who approached her to get

30
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:51,213
my info or not, Team Leader Taek?

31
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:57,033
So, how's Lee Ji Han doing?

32
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:01,473
 Is there something else on your mind? 

33
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:03,623
 Should we stop by the temple or the cathedral later? 

34
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,343
 I'm worried about our sales. 

35
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:07,533
 I didn't pay attention for a few days, and it's terrible. 

36
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,783
 For your information, I don't believe in any religion now. 

37
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,633
 Are you serious? 

38
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,173
 The confusion is over. 

39
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,653
 I'm only going to trust myself now. 

40
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,653
 Isn't it a nice thing? 

41
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:22,653
 I don't have to wonder if I'm possessed by Satan or if it's karma. 

42
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:26,833
   

43
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,723
 I got it. 

44
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:32,423
 Don't worry about me, and have a good time with A Jeong. 

45
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:35,703
 Are you serious? 

46
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,363
 Heartaches are over. 

47
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:39,403
 I'll focus on recovery now. 

48
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,643
 Isn't it such a nice thing? 

49
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:48,243
 This simple life where I no longer have to wonder what Brother and that woman are doing. 

50
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:49,743
What should I call it?

51
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:54,943
I guess he seems like someone who finally found peace after a big storm?

52
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:57,313
He's not scheming anything and

53
00:04:57,313 --> 00:05:00,053
he's actually doing well.

54
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,483
What's going on?

55
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,473
Well, he must've realized it now.

56
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:07,763
That he doesn't need to care about you anymore.

57
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:10,623
The chairman accepted you and the family introduction dinner is over, too.

58
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:13,013
It's basically game over.

59
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,783
To stop losing energy over meaningless opposition,

60
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:20,083
don’t you think Jihan would like to focus on his company’s work?

61
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,993
Ji Han, did you get a new car?

62
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,133
- Yes, I did. 
 - What's the occasion?

63
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:43,193
You said a car only needs to roll. You weren't thinking of getting a new one yet.

64
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:47,183
I'll sprint into my life ahead with a new car and a new state of mind.

65
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:49,033
All right, then.

66
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,633
What kind of life is he sprinting into

67
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,533
that he's looking so wonderful?

68
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,513
He must be sprinting toward debt.

69
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:14,473
He must be a "Car Poor." How could he afford a car like that on a deputy's wage? 
  (Poor with a nice car) 

70
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,663
Is he going on a date with that woman from last time?

71
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:20,073
That must be. It must be that woman.

72
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,433
I thought you'd take longer to think. You concluded sooner than I thought.

73
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,003
I took longer than I should have.

74
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:33,303
I should've answered you on the spot right then.

75
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:35,573
But it took longer to organize my thoughts because I digressed.

76
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,673
So? What's your answer?

77
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:42,713
Work! I'm going to work hard.

78
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,293
Work, you say?

79
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,353
So that everything will find its place.

80
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:49,013
My feelings are included in there, too.

81
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,573
How vague.

82
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:54,533
Is this what they call keeping someone on the hook?

83
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,933
Deal! I'll be one of your fish.

84
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:06,413
Since a vague "I don't know" is better than a certain rejection.

85
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,933
Doing business is the same.

86
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,923
It's easier to dig in when there's an opening.

87
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,733
Work hard like you're getting paid.

88
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,263
I'll get into it like I'm dating.

89
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,433
 So, try your best to be happy 

90
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,853
 with my brother. 

91
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,103
All right.

92
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,773
Let's be happy.

93
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,143
No big deal. Right?

94
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,103
He told me to be happy.

95
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,023
That guy finally said he'd acknowledge me.

96
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,293
 My happiness is Brother's happiness. 

97
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:14,643
 So, if Brother is supposed to have something, I want that to be the very best. 

98
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:16,763
 In my world, this is normal. 

99
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,923
 Do you have a problem with that? 

100
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,703
Congrats, Na A Jeong.

101
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:31,283
You finally stole Lee Ji Han's brother from him.

102
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:41,303
   

103
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,473
My gosh...

104
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:56,613
You overcame a major hurdle by getting through the family introduction.

105
00:08:56,613 --> 00:09:00,983
The chairman is also happy about it, so don't worry too much.

106
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,023
- By the way, Secretary Kim. 
 - Yes.

107
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:05,023
I've been wondering about this.

108
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,393
Why do you think Grandfather's so invested in my marriage?

109
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:13,103
I honestly thought Grandfather would oppose A Jeong.

110
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:17,063
But he's helping us on top of approving her.

111
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,183
I just don't get it.

112
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:24,593
I believe the chairman is probably wishing to atone

113
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:28,203
for having opposed President Hyeon Soo Hyeon and your father.

114
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:31,483
The chairman might seem okay,

115
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:34,513
but his scar from back then still has not healed.

116
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:37,903
I'm not my mother's replacement, nor can I be.

117
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:40,643
Yes, of course!

118
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:43,863
But he could still try to give you a chance.

119
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:49,103
Perhaps, a chance for everyone who was hurt because of that incident.

120
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,843
What is it?

121
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,643
Gosh, my goodness.

122
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:00,623
- What? 
 - Gosh!

123
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:01,743
Stay put.

124
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:03,393
Why?

125
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,273
Come this way.

126
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,543
You suggested we find out what Grandfather's thinking over a dinner.

127
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:12,183
Why are we going back home suddenly?

128
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:17,783
Honey, we rooted for Na A Jeong so she can be a setback to Do Han's succession.

129
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,073
But she's about to become a stepping stone.

130
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:24,433
Do Han and Grandfather are only going to become closer through this marriage!

131
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:27,423
Honey, let's ignite a bomb.

132
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:28,703
A bomb?

133
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:33,063
We'll ignite a bomb with our lips! Boom!

134
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:38,673
Gosh, aren't your teeth cold?

135
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:41,163
- They are. 
 - They are?

136
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,953
Excuse me, let me ask you a question.

137
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:46,043
- Oh, sure. 
 - I'm looking for

138
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:50,413
this house right now. Do you know which way it is?

139
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:52,213
Wait! Who are you?

140
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:55,933
Oh, I'm a reporter from Jegook Daily.

141
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:56,933
I see.

142
00:10:56,933 --> 00:11:02,253
We got a report that the LJ Group's third grandson's fiancée lives around here.

143
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,123
Is it this house?

144
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,243
- Oh, it's our house. 
 - This is your house?

145
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:09,673
Gosh, all the houses look so similar around here.

146
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:12,133
He must've been mistaken, goodness!

147
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,953
No one like that lives around here.

148
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,463
No, i-it's not our house.

149
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:18,443
Hey, let's go. Let's go home.

150
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,313
Let's go.

151
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,383
- Is anyone home? 
 - Yes.

152
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,653
Please let me ask you something.

153
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:26,083
How can I help?

154
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,713
Hello, I'm a reporter from Daily Fact—

155
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:33,143
Are you the lady who will marry the LJ Group's grandson?

156
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:36,253
I came to get word from you about the marriage.

157
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,273
- Please open the door. 
 - W-Wait.

158
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,473
Never mind the door.

159
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:42,453
I don't know what you're talking about.

160
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,953
Oh, my! LJ, my foot.

161
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,563
No one like that lives here.

162
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,543
She's right!

163
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,313
This woman is mine.

164
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,793
Not someone who'd marry that LJ something!

165
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,083
She's the mother of my child. Mother of Jo Tae Min's child.

166
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,713
I don't know what's wrong with them. But you got the wrong house.

167
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:01,783
- Go look elsewhere, please. 
 - Yes, I apologize.

168
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:04,173
Okay, take care.

169
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:07,683
Honey, he left! He must've come for Sis.

170
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,363
What's going on? What's this?

171
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,443
Why are there so many reporters looking for A Jeong in our neighborhood—

172
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:16,943
- Oh, my. 
 - Dad, b-be quiet!

173
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,683
Is someone looking for me?

174
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,973
- Sis, go back inside! Go back! 
 - Gosh, go back inside!

175
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,133
- Go back inside! 
 - Go inside!

176
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,133
- What's the matter? 
 - Go, go, go!

177
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,433
I sprained my ankle!

178
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:34,163
My friend in the secretaries' office told me that our chairman's grandson is really getting married.

179
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:36,203
They're busy trying to stop those news articles.

180
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,753
I'm sure they'll take care of it.

181
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,083
The secretaries' office must be prepared for stuff like that.

182
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:44,023
No. They prepared a fake press release since his fiancée is an ordinary person.

183
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:45,693
But the real intel has been leaked, giving them trouble.

184
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,903
Marrying the chairman's grandson must be tiring, too.

185
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:51,203
She's an ordinary person, but the reporters will harass her nonetheless.

186
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,083
We're the only ones who'd be tired.

187
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,663
We went through hell with the stock prices going up and down because of that chairman's grandson.

188
00:12:57,663 --> 00:13:00,933
Won't this disturb the atmosphere at work again?

189
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,523
Don't you think so, Ji Han?

190
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:05,403
Yeah, right.

191
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:17,103
Can you move into their house when you're not even married yet?

192
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:20,723
I think there are more reporters outside, too.

193
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:23,563
But I can't just stay inside forever.

194
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:26,223
Our family will be harassed more if I stay here.

195
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,583
But can you trust his family?

196
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,133
"Because we want to protect her."

197
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:32,673
It was smooth talking, but see what happened in the end.

198
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:35,233
- Hey, take this with you. 
 - What?

199
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,493
I couldn't pack a lot because I was in a rush.

200
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:40,493
Take it and share it with Do Han.

201
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:43,803
You know, right? If you're uncomfortable at any given point, come right back.

202
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,583
Let's not overreact, please.

203
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,743
Grandfather's secretary said he'll take measures to quiet down the situation.

204
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:55,033
- So I'm only staying outside until then. 
 - What's going on, seriously?

205
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:59,233
Hey, you know, be careful and get there safely.

206
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,883
- Text me if you get bored. 
 - Okay.

207
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,443
Mom.

208
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,503
- I'll carry it for you. L-Let Dad— 
 - N-No, no!

209
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:08,143
- It's fine. 
 - Just stay put.

210
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:09,483
G-Get there safely!

211
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,003
Bye!

212
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:12,973
 Bye, Ji Oh. 

213
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,853
Look.

214
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:21,553
Do you like me?

215
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:22,833
- Sorry? 
 - I mean,

216
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,463
I think it'll be better to make things clear.

217
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:29,593
If you do like me, go ahead and ask me out right now.

218
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,573
Well, I mean...

219
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:36,613
I don't even have my lines prepared properly.

220
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,123
Yes.

221
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:42,683
J-Ji Ae,

222
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,753
since the day this cafe opened in front of my workplace,

223
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:52,513
I've always had feelings...

224
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,083
for...

225
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,593
I need to hear a love confession to decide whether I should reject or accept.

226
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,853
Sorry? Reject or accept?

227
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,463
Is it true you have feelings for me?

228
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:06,113
I can answer you now. Right?

229
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,473
You see, I have no interest in—

230
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,983
Something went inside my ears.

231
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:18,373
So, as long as I don't confess having feelings for you,

232
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:20,783
no one will be rejecting anyone. Right?

233
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:24,473
Wait! You just said, "I've had feelings for..."

234
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:28,083
I've had feelings for you as the owner!

235
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,133
That's what I was going to say.

236
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:33,663
T-This place has the best coffee around here.

237
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:35,863
I like your coffee.

238
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,403
What did he say? Did he say he likes you?

239
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:50,663
- He confessed that he likes... 
 - Oh my god!

240
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,063
...my coffee.

241
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:56,523
- What? 
 - Gosh, this pisses me off.

242
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,813
Though I have no interest,

243
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:03,033
I was a little bit willing to accept if he confessed with sincerity.

244
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,433
Gosh, who is he to say—

245
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:08,873
Who is he to make me feel like I was rejected?

246
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:19,333
Taek, Chairman furiously asks where the information leaked.

247
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:24,353
This cup of coffee is my only comfort right now.

248
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:26,103
Really?

249
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:32,143
This cup of coffee is my only sorrow right now.

250
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:42,133
You're also going through a lot because of Ji Han.

251
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,173
You two still call yourselves family?

252
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,993
How can family members

253
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:52,873
have nothing better to do than to prattle about family matters to reporters?

254
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:54,873
This is unfair, Grandfather.

255
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:58,163
- Yes, we did leak info on Na A Jeong. 
 - And?

256
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:01,413
We didn't bring the reporter to Mother's Memorial Park.

257
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:05,313
He's right! And the public has the right to know the truth, Grandfather.

258
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:07,023
The truth?

259
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:10,013
Sure. I don't know about the truth,

260
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:13,033
but I can tell you my sincerity.

261
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:19,743
I have no intention of leaving my company to the two of you.

262
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:21,573
Don't even dream about it.

263
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,083
That's my sincerity.

264
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,753
Hey!

265
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,223
Hey!

266
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,203
You brat! Have you gone mad?

267
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:44,133
- You did all this. Right? 
 - What?

268
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,743
- "What"? 
 - Look at her pretending not to know.

269
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:50,703
Miss, I saw everything. I saw you smiling while looking at us!

270
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,643
Are you framing us for what you did?

271
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:55,423
You brat, how dare you do this to your brother—

272
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:58,143
Why? Can't I frame you for once?

273
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,243
You framed me for your drunk driving.

274
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,193
- Choi Seung Ah! 
 - You knew my name, huh?

275
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:05,013
I didn't know you knew because you always call me a brat.

276
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:08,083
Miss, you're making a huge mistake right now.

277
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,673
- If Father finds out, he won't let you— 
 - Of course, he won't.

278
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,903
Once he finds out Brother lost Grandfather's favor,

279
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:17,503
he'd choose someone else, wouldn't he?

280
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,283
This is why I told you!

281
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:27,343
There's no need to be wary of either one of them!

282
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:30,343
You just have to get rid of them both!

283
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:35,243
I warned you in advance.

284
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,053
You're the one who didn't understand.

285
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:39,543
Idiot! Idiot!

286
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,233
You think it'll be you if not me?

287
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,803
Don't be confused. It won't be you.

288
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:47,673
It'll be me. Just wait and see, then.

289
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,803
Just keep your mouth shut.

290
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:03,953
Honey, what do we do now?

291
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:07,333
Is it really over for you and me? Is that true?

292
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,563
- Let go! 
 - Say something, seriously!

293
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:33,583
It looks like I thought too lightly of marriage.

294
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,853
Marriage is easy.

295
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,313
It's the fame that's hard.

296
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:40,913
Should I just do the interview?

297
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,953
- What? 
 - Think about it.

298
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:46,843
I don't really understand why I should hide now that I think about it.

299
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:48,613
People are curious about me, too.

300
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:54,413
So I'll just quit being mysterious and come out with the cold, hard fact.

301
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:57,533
It's also a shame to hide my face.

302
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:03,643
With this incident and during the family introduction, too...

303
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:07,413
I keep making you care about stuff you shouldn't have to.

304
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,603
- Sorry. 
 - Forget it.

305
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:12,413
You need to quit apologizing.

306
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:16,283
And your brother did cover it up nicely.

307
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:20,173
I'm glad that Ji Han finally accepted you.

308
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:23,313
I'm not sure. Whether that was acceptance or

309
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:26,553
just giving up, we don't know that.

310
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:31,033
But I still don't know if it's right for me to come here.

311
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,883
It's not like you live here alone.

312
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:35,853
I'm really fine with staying at your studio—

313
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,143
Na A Jeong, I'm not fine with that.

314
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:40,613
It's fine. Just make yourself at home.

315
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,613
By the way, what did she pack for you?

316
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,993
- Mom just packed some side dishes for us. 
 - I see.

317
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,073
Terry, how are you doing?

318
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:51,993
I'm home.

319
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,943
Is no one home?

320
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:23,733
   

321
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:27,723
   

322
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:30,313
   

323
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:33,643
   

324
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:35,873
Nothing's been posted yet.

325
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,683
Lee Ji Han,

326
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,593
you were so pathetic at Stone-Wall Road, and what are you doing now?

327
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,513
If you accepted her, that's it.

328
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,543
No need to care about that woman anymore. Okay?

329
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:16,863
My eyesight is minus 6.0.

330
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:21,423
I wasn't wearing my glasses earlier and didn't see anything. So don't worry.

331
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:26,353
H-Hey, didn't you say you got LASIK last year?

332
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:31,853
So, why did you come inside so quietly without making a noise?

333
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:35,983
I see. So you're saying this is my fault.

334
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:38,253
I came inside my home too quietly. Right?

335
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:40,923
No, that's not what I'm saying.

336
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,933
You should've worn your clothes after the shower.

337
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,703
Oh, you're right. That's my fault, too.

338
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:48,203
I was too naked inside my own home. Right?

339
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,623
That's not it.

340
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:52,173
It's my fault. I-I'm the one at fault.

341
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:55,233
I should've made more noise.

342
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,873
- I'm so sorry. 
 - No, not at all, Sister-in-law.

343
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,603
It's my fault for not being careful inside my home.

344
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:03,783
If you're mad, just get mad!

345
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,363
It bothers me more if you act like this.

346
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:09,313
Get mad? I'm not mad at all, Sister-in-law.

347
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:14,263
Of course, we should escort you safely if reporters swarmed your home, Sister-in-law.

348
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:16,013
Wait a minute, you...

349
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:18,213
Since when did you call A Jeong your "sister-in-law"?

350
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:19,653
Just now.

351
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,993
Anyhow, please be at home while you stay here.

352
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:24,783
All right, then.

353
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,783
What about her room, though?

354
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:40,523
You two aren't using the same room, are you?

355
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,733
How ridiculous!

356
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:55,573
Since when did he treat me like a sister-in-law to be calling me that?

357
00:23:55,573 --> 00:23:59,083
 Hey, Sister-in-law— Sister-in-law— Sister-in-law— Don't you think so, Sister-in-law? 

358
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:02,963
Ridiculous.

359
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:16,183
I can really sleep in the living room.

360
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:19,033
- Where are you going? 
 - I've got something to do.

361
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,143
Hey, Lee Ji Han.

362
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:27,013
Thank you for accepting A Jeong.

363
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:29,103
What the heck? That's so cheesy.

364
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:31,903
Go ahead and sleep. I'm leaving.

365
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,843
Come home early.

366
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:43,063
You should've been dressed.

367
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:45,263
You should've at least worked out.

368
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,903
Hey, whether they're using the same room or not,

369
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,293
you shouldn't have said that, seriously!

370
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:54,063
 If she uses the same room as you, Sister-in-law might feel uncomfortable. 

371
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:56,613
 Since you two aren't married yet, it'd be embarrassing. 

372
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,193
 Sister-in-law, don't you have any sleeping habits? 

373
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,793
 My brother has terrible sleeping habits. He even hits people. 

374
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,023
Gosh, seriously.

375
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:07,783
It's fine.

376
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:10,413
You can live. You can do it.

377
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:13,503
Treat her as a total sister-in-law and

378
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:18,253
I can live with her under one roof.

379
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:42,723
 I'm totally not against you two using the same bed. 

380
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:47,433
 It's just that why use one bed in a huge house like this? 

381
00:25:58,383 --> 00:26:00,753
I really bought a nice one for cheap.

382
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,773
Once she leaves, it's over.

383
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,563
This is our Ji Oh's room from now on.

384
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:15,233
Of course. Then you and I will have a lovely time and make Ji Oh's younger sibling!

385
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,103
Honey!

386
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:19,953
- What a pervert. 
 - My goodness.

387
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,623
- By the way, Honey. 
 - Yes?

388
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,243
Didn't you say your family moved here when A Jeong entered college?

389
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:27,313
- That's right. 
 - How come her fourth-grade textbook is here?

390
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:29,583
Gosh, she's always been like that.

391
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,653
Look here. She saved all the scripts she's worked with.

392
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:36,513
She only had a few lines. Why treasure them so much?

393
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,833
I think these are A Jeong's contracts.

394
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:43,633
Seriously, she should've cleaned them up already.

395
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,473
She always makes others do her job.

396
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,873
Appearance Agreement.

397
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,583
What's this now?

398
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,033
   

399
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:54,343
Marriage Contract?

400
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:58,233
"Lee Do Han and Na A Jeong will...

401
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,663
The drama, "Three Years of..."

402
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:03,113
The client and the cast?"

403
00:27:26,153 --> 00:27:28,323
Who are you?

404
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:31,803
Where's Na A Jeong?

405
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,253
Do Han must've left already.

406
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:00,263
Is that a rolled omelet?

407
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,073
I love rolled omelets.

408
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:03,723
They look so delicious.

409
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,923
It's for you, Sister-in-law.

410
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:08,043
I heard you always eat breakfast, so I prepared it for you, Sister-in-law.

411
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:10,013
Please come this way.

412
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,703
You don't need to do all this...

413
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:23,713
Why is there only one bowl of rice, though?

414
00:28:23,713 --> 00:28:27,403
Oh, I always skip breakfast, Sister-in-law.

415
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:30,613
I feel bad eating breakfast alone when I'm freeloading.

416
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,913
Why feel bad?

417
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:35,923
I should do this much as your brother-in-law in my house, Sister-in-law.

418
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,433
Why do you keep adding "Sister-in-law" at the end of everything you say?

419
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,843
Brother-in-law, Brother-in-law, Brother-in-law.

420
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,633
Because you're my sister-in-law, Sister-in-law.

421
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:45,283
Now, then. Please enjoy.

422
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:47,123
Sister-in-law.

423
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:52,383
Don't be like that and come eat with me!

424
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:54,180

Not at all, Sister-in-law. I'll do them so you can rest.

Also, is there a dryer here?

00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:12,273
Acknowledge me, my foot.

451
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:16,543
He doesn't even mean it, but keeps calling me Sister-in-law.

452
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:43,073
This one makes exactly 1,000 cranes. Right?

453
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:45,313
You folded them yourself.

454
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:49,603
These can only be for one thing. 1,000 paper cranes to grant your wish.

455
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,543
I knew you've been weird since that day.

456
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:55,803
Don't even try to get out of this.

457
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:58,723
It's a wish regarding me. Right?

458
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,863
Tell me what you wish for.

459
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:03,253
You don't need to know.

460
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:08,393
You lied when you told me to be happy with Do Han that day. Right?

461
00:31:08,393 --> 00:31:11,593
Tell me. What did you wish for with those?

462
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:15,373
Did you wish I'd get away from Do Han or something?

463
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,263
No.

464
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:20,343
It's the opposite.

465
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,503
I wished I'd get away.

466
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:33,973
I meant every single word I said that day.

467
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:40,693
And after accepting you as my sister-in-law, my heart was at peace.

468
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:45,203
So much so that I felt the times I opposed you

469
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,953
and my damaged skin were a waste.

470
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:58,583
But why do you say you acknowledge me...

471
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:03,643
as if you're trying to push me away, Lee Ji Han?

472
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:11,743
Whatever it may be, what matters is that this is my place.

473
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:17,143
So, I'd like for you to keep your place.

474
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:24,763
Going in and out of someone else's room and

475
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:27,203
rummaging through the trash can.

476
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:31,163
That's crossing the line. Right?

477
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:06,573
 Yes, I did meet a person who knows you. 

478
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,443
 He even knew you got a new door lock. 

479
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:12,533
I'm sure he knew you and I were getting married, too.

480
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,553
He's your ex, huh?

481
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:16,383
Right?

482
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:20,983
 It was a pleasure. I'll see you again next time. 

483
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:25,933
 I knew it. His tone was a little off. 

484
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,593
But how did he know we were getting married?

485
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:31,333
And how did he know it was me?

486
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:39,283
A Jeong, I think I'll be a little late today.

487
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,293
Don't wait for me and rest at home.

488
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:06,813
What's up?

489
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:08,903
Did your power go out again?

490
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:11,043
I heard you met A Jeong.

491
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:16,673
I did, by chance.

492
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:17,873
By chance?

493
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:20,023
Yes, by chance.

494
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:24,533
How strange. So many things are happening to me by chance lately.

495
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,453
Someone keeps sending me pictures of me they took secretly by chance.

496
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:29,643
My studio's power keeps going out by chance.

497
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:34,623
My fiancée even meets my acquaintance by chance.

498
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:40,683
You better not mess with A Jeong.

499
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:42,963
That's crossing the line.

500
00:34:43,863 --> 00:34:45,563
You're angry.

501
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:49,763
I might even think you that really like that woman.

502
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:52,063
When you said you'd hurt me,

503
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:55,723
did you mean you'd get your revenge by blackmailing me like this?

504
00:34:55,723 --> 00:34:57,623
Do Han,

505
00:34:57,623 --> 00:35:01,003
I think you're the one crossing the line right now.

506
00:35:01,003 --> 00:35:04,273
Do you feel even an inkling of guilt toward me?

507
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:05,663
I don't.

508
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:09,513
I used to, but you got rid of it all just now.

509
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:12,123
So you better quit at this point.

510
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:15,313
Stop lingering around in my life.

511
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:48,633
From what I found out, Lee Do Han and that man hardly made contact.

512
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:51,143
They do have a few common acquaintances, but only a couple.

513
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:55,103
Wouldn't it be more correct to say they're just strangers?

514
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:57,553
You don't really know about this, Managing Director Choi.

515
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,433
Those relationships are usually more interesting.

516
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,803
They hardly meet, but if he reacts so sharply. This means...

517
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:04,653
there's something there.

518
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:07,863
I want to know about Lee Do Han, Na A Jeong,

519
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:11,953
and Lee Ji Han. I thought I made this clear.

520
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:15,983
If you sell me a face I don't know without those three,

521
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:19,413
wouldn't it annoy me a bit, Reporter Kang?

522
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:23,913
If he's stuck in there, it'd mean he's at the intersection.

523
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:27,993
Who knows? This man might have something to do with Na A Jeong as well.

524
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:31,903
Come to me when you've found that something, then.

525
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:34,013
Hold on now.

526
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:38,533
In that case,

527
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,503
what's in it for me?

528
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:45,233
It'd be a useful hand for you, Managing Director Choi.

529
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:50,483
But it won't even make the headlines, even if I get a scoop out of this.

530
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:53,643
I can tell what's in it for you,

531
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,423
but I can't really tell what's in it for me.

532
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,463
Tell me what you want clearly.

533
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:01,383
I hate beating around the bush.

534
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:11,083
Your mother's case.

535
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:15,803
I'd also like to clear my name as well.

536
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:19,073
I think it'd be a win-win for us.

537
00:37:20,273 --> 00:37:22,333
Reporter Kang.

538
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:30,923
You know I'm not sitting across from you and drinking tea together

539
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:35,153
because I look favorably upon you. Right?

540
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:39,503
Though my mom abandoned her family for her affair,

541
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:41,613
Hyeon Soo Hyeon's still my mom.

542
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:45,683
And you caused the accident that killed Hyeon Soo Hyeon.

543
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,133
I haven't forgotten.

544
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:51,733
That's why I'm saying I need to clear my name.

545
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:58,033
Aren't you curious

546
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:02,813
about the truth that will be revealed once my name's cleared?

547
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:16,073
What are you thinking about?

548
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:17,443
Huh?

549
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:19,843
Nothing really.

550
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:23,013
Had I known, we should've gone to the aquarium.

551
00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:28,683
So I can introduce you to my fish friends to commemorate my first time getting hooked on in life.

552
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:33,683
So many people want to introduce me to their friends today.

553
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:36,333
Fish friends and bird friends.

554
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,873
Bird?

555
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:39,353
Well, yes.

556
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:42,953
1,000 birds who can't fly away because they're locked up in my house.

557
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:48,053
I thought the swallow with the broken leg was the worst.

558
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:50,813
But those guys are even worse.

559
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:54,473
They won't let me do anything.

560
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:07,533
How long is Na A Jeong staying at your place?

561
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,673
Who knows?

562
00:39:09,673 --> 00:39:11,403
I guess she'll stay for good.

563
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:14,103
- For good? 
 - Once she marries my brother,

564
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:16,363
wouldn't they live together?

565
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:20,423
I'm sure she'll nest in my house.

566
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:24,153
You're in deep trouble, Lee Ji Han.

567
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,703
You'll need to find your own place soon.

568
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:30,603
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable to be stuck with newlyweds?

569
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:34,483
I think it'd be better if you came to me as soon as possible.

570
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:38,693
Don't worry.

571
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:41,583
I'm already doing my best.

572
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:02,733
- Unni. 
 - My gosh!

573
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,543
It's me. Come inside.

574
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:10,713
Unni.

575
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,973
That person.

576
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,623
Do you know him? You don't, right?

577
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:22,103
Didn't he follow me in?

578
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,313
He's a regular, all right?

579
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:26,413
He's a regular?

580
00:40:28,503 --> 00:40:30,913
It's really tiring, seriously.

581
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:33,513
You two should reconsider becoming famous.

582
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,733
This really isn't a walk in the park.

583
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,493
It's not easy.

584
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:41,763
She's got the worst case of celebrity disease!

585
00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:45,033
So how is it living in your fiancé's place?

586
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,373
What about the brother-in-law? Does he still get on your nerves?

587
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,053
He doesn't.

588
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:53,013
Amazing. He said he'd accept you, so I guess he meant it.

589
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:56,233
The bad commenter must've finally become a good commenter.

590
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:59,653
But why do the good comments bother me even more?

591
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:02,213
I think it was better when he was determined to oppose us.

592
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:04,473
I'm sure it'd bother you.

593
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:06,603
Anyway, it means you defeated him.

594
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:09,583
Wouldn't it be something like the winner's compassion for the loser?

595
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,723
That's true, but...

596
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:15,523
Whenever he calls me "sister-in-law,"

597
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:18,103
it feels like I've got a stone stuck here.

598
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,933
It feels like I'm getting indigestion.

599
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:21,853
It's not getting stuck but pulled out.

600
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:24,253
It's not indigestion but getting flushed.

601
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:26,263
No one is opposing your marriage now.

602
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:29,453
Don't you just have to sail smoothly for your wedding now?

603
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,643
She's right. I think you're worried for no reason.

604
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:36,573
Everything's going well, so why be so worried?

605
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:39,643
You think so?

606
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,083
Team Leader, are you free after work today?

607
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,933
After work, why?

608
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:53,943
Go on about your businesses.

609
00:41:56,013 --> 00:42:00,253
Are you trying to resume your Better Life Project or something?

610
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:03,013
No, it's nothing like that.

611
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:05,273
Do you want to grab a drink?

612
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,053
A drink sounds great.

613
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:09,973
A drink?

614
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:11,213
Is something wrong?

615
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:13,643
No, it's not like that.

616
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:17,543
I just want to get home late.

617
00:42:22,393 --> 00:42:24,293
See you later.

618
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:27,943
Honey, Honey, Honey—

619
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:30,613
Let go of me. I need to tell them what's wrong is wrong.

620
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:32,583
Wait, but still...

621
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,443
Is marriage a joke, huh?

622
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:36,313
- Na A Jeong is dead today. 
 - Honey.

623
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,503
Hey, Na A Jeong. Na A Jeong!

624
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:40,793
Honey, let's quiet down a bit.

625
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:43,993
- There are other residents inside— 
 - Gosh.

626
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:46,663
Na Soo Jeong?

627
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:48,723
Tae Min?

628
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:51,913
A Jeong, run! I'll make you some time—

629
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,953
Hey, you crazy bitch!

630
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:56,263
- W-Why? W-What's wrong? 
 - Hey, you fucking lunatic.

631
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:58,573
- You've finally gone mad, huh? 
 - W-Why?

632
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:00,583
Hey! Hey!

633
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,723
- What's gotten into you? 
 - What's gotten into me?

634
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:04,313
What's gotten into me, you ask?

635
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:05,983
Hey.

636
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,733
    
 What's this?

637
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,173
Marriage Contract?

638
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:20,243
Ever since you pretended to be Mom in elementary school and answered grade confirmation calls,

639
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:22,883
I knew you were a scammer, Sis.

640
00:43:22,883 --> 00:43:25,393
A fake marriage? Does that even make sense?

641
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:27,833
- It's acting, not fake. 
 - Hey!

642
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,593
Do you even get married as an act, huh?

643
00:43:29,593 --> 00:43:32,693
Do you want to go to prison and get criminal records as part of your act, too?

644
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,543
Honey, let's hear out A Jeong, too.

645
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:40,593
Don't you think she signed such a contract because she had a plan?

646
00:43:42,763 --> 00:43:45,493
It's my first lead acting role and...

647
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:47,533
What?

648
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:49,763
I mean, honestly,

649
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:53,343
things just aren't working out for me, and

650
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:55,503
my dream seems so far away.

651
00:43:55,503 --> 00:43:59,713
But Do Han just begged me so earnestly at that exact moment.

652
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:02,943
Of course, I refused at first.

653
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:08,233
But the pay didn't seem so bad after listening to him and

654
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,313
the treatment sounded not too bad, either.

655
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:19,593
But I'm not sure, either.

656
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:22,923
I thought it was just an everyday life act.

657
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:26,973
But I feel like I keep lying more and more.

658
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:30,243
I thought it'd be the role of my life,

659
00:44:30,243 --> 00:44:34,893
but I think I'm only becoming a nuisance.

660
00:44:34,893 --> 00:44:36,433
You...

661
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:39,533
Hey, should you be saying that right now?

662
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:42,633
You didn't even think about that when you signed this?

663
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:50,333
Hey, did you think things through when you had a baby out of wedlock with Tae Min?

664
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:58,163
But what can I do? They were all my choices.

665
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:02,443
Since I've come this far, I'll have to see this to the end.

666
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,413
You're being really immature.

667
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:08,383
Do you even know what's waiting for you at the end to say that?

668
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:16,843
Hey, Na Soo Jeong!

669
00:45:16,843 --> 00:45:19,463
If you leave like this, how about my uneasiness?

670
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:22,763
Don't worry too much about Soo Jeong. I'll try to lighten her up.

671
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,773
A Jeong, I'm rooting for you. Okay?

672
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:28,873
You know, knives rust if you don't use them

673
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:31,023
and our bodies stiffen if we don't use them.

674
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:32,803
Isn't acting just the same?

675
00:45:32,803 --> 00:45:37,523
If you feel like it's not working out, you can put it to use like this.

676
00:45:37,523 --> 00:45:40,123
You're more awesome than you think.

677
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:42,163
I mean it.

678
00:45:46,193 --> 00:45:49,013
Fine. See it to the end.

679
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:51,753
It's your life, not mine.

680
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:53,413
You'll keep it a secret.

681
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:57,853
Just don't get caught by anyone. Especially Mom and Dad.

682
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:02,713
You probably don't know, but Mom and Dad already bragged to the aunts who looked down on you.

683
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:05,943
Do you know how happy Mom and Dad were to hear you're getting married?

684
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:09,633
It'll hurt them the same whether you get caught or break it off at this point.

685
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,833
So, last all three years, no matter what, and get divorced quietly.

686
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:17,423
Did you understand what I said?

687
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:20,053
I got it, Soo Jeong.

688
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,303
I'm sorry.

689
00:46:21,303 --> 00:46:23,603
Gosh, this is annoying!

690
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:27,083
That blabbermouth couldn't even tell anyone about it.

691
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,793
She must've been suffering all alone.

692
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:35,233
By the way, A Jeong, with that much money,

693
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:39,193
can't you implant enough hair for Father, so he'll look like Bigfoot?

694
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:41,263
Bigfoot, whoa!

695
00:46:41,263 --> 00:46:43,223
Hurry up and come!

696
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:46,103
All right. A Jeong.

697
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:10,143
Drink up.

698
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:20,663
Take one more shot.

699
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:32,463
I had so many things I wanted to tell you.

700
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:34,683
But first things first,

701
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:38,683
I'll tell you about a dream I had one day.

702
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:42,203
It's still vivid in my memory.

703
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:47,793
In the dream, I planted a peach tree in my front yard.

704
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:54,743
But those big, ripe peaches suddenly dropped all at once.

705
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:58,433
Could this have been A Jeong's conception dream?

706
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:02,073
My daughter shows up from here.

707
00:48:02,073 --> 00:48:07,873
All of a sudden, this large dog popped out of nowhere and devoured all those peaches.

708
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:11,643
Gosh, it was so scary.

709
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:16,053
Ten months later, my daughter was born.

710
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:19,153
Goodnes, maybe because her conception dream was like that.

711
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:22,673
She was obsessed with food and so greedy.

712
00:48:22,673 --> 00:48:28,513
Whenever she was upset, she'd charge at you like she was going to bite you.

713
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:33,253
She's my child, but it was really hard.

714
00:48:33,253 --> 00:48:36,003
You must've been through a lot.

715
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:54,263
I was really happy raising a daughter.

716
00:48:54,263 --> 00:49:00,213
Sometimes she seemed so pathetic because it felt like she was sucking the life out of me.

717
00:49:00,213 --> 00:49:04,413
I also got angry often because she wouldn't do as I wished.

718
00:49:04,413 --> 00:49:11,753
But strangely enough, I'm so proud of and thankful for her.

719
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:16,143
All things aside, I'd like to make just one request.

720
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:18,773
Yes, please go ahead, Father.

721
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:25,163
Please just let her live without having to walk on eggshells.

722
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:27,603
So that she can do whatever she wants to do

723
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:31,773
and not suffer alone and hold it in.

724
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:36,493
Because that's how I raised A Jeong.

725
00:49:36,493 --> 00:49:38,623
Yes, I'll do that, Father.

726
00:49:38,623 --> 00:49:42,223
I'll take good care of A Jeong, so don't worry.

727
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:46,403
- Okay. Here. 
 - Yes.

728
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:49,493
Did you know this?

729
00:49:49,493 --> 00:49:54,233
Today is the first time you asked me to drink with you after getting to know you, Ji Han.

730
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:58,693
Congrats on seeing the new me.

731
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:00,533
Of course.

732
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:06,843
So, why are you trying to go home late?

733
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:12,053
My brother and Na A Jeong are nesting in my house.

734
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:16,423
I kind of understand Hong Gil Dong's feelings these days.

735
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:18,373
I don't want to call him, Brother, and

736
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:20,153
I don't want to call her, Sister-in-law.

737
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:23,273
Hong Gil Dong couldn't do it, not that he didn't want to.

738
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:25,013
Why does that matter right now?

739
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:28,523
What matters is I'm having to do it even though I hate it.

740
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:33,033
If I keep doing it, I'll get used to it, and

741
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,933
it'll become more comfortable once I get used to it. Right?

742
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:39,633
It's great. You sound like a master.

743
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:42,573
Oh, there's also something I heard.

744
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:46,313
If you fake it until you make it, it becomes your life.

745
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:48,913
That's what people said.

746
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:52,143
Faking it sounds great.

747
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:56,263
That's what I do best in the world.

748
00:50:57,413 --> 00:50:59,133
Cheers.

749
00:51:09,993 --> 00:51:12,683
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

750
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:14,843
Just how much did he drink?

751
00:51:14,843 --> 00:51:16,613
He drank three shots of soju.

752
00:51:16,613 --> 00:51:18,993
- Three shots? He drank more than he could handle! 
 - Yes.

753
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:22,403
Tae Min, what are you doing? Carry him on your back.

754
00:51:23,973 --> 00:51:27,533
Goodness, goodness, goodness! He's totally out.

755
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:31,963
Is there something you want to tell me?

756
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,313
Keep in mind that I'm always watching.

757
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:37,193
I'm watching as well.

758
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:38,993
What nonsense are you two uttering suddenly?

759
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:41,343
Quit the nonsense and hurry inside.

760
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:42,613
- T-Thank you. 
 - Sure.

761
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:46,363
Go home before A Jeong starts worrying. Okay?

762
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:54,983
Get home safe!

763
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:57,973
Keep it in mind.

764
00:52:14,743 --> 00:52:16,783
It's Na A Jeong.

765
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:22,283
What are you doing outside in this cold? You should be sleeping.

766
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:25,083
You called me.

767
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:28,143
You told me not to sleep because you wanted to say something.

768
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:31,073
Oh, right. I said that.

769
00:52:31,073 --> 00:52:32,333
Sorry.

770
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,313
You drank, huh?

771
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:37,153
Go inside and sleep. Let's talk tomorrow.

772
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,413
No, let's talk right now.

773
00:52:39,413 --> 00:52:41,553
I want to talk right now.

774
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:51,243
A Jeong, I know I'll sound really selfish.

775
00:52:51,243 --> 00:52:53,703
But I'm really happy right now.

776
00:52:54,473 --> 00:53:00,343
Thanks to you, I'm not feeling anxious for the first time.

777
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:04,563
So I'm going to make sure you feel the same.

778
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:08,753
I'll become a really reliable husband.

779
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,233
I'll let you do everything you want to do

780
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,653
and I'll take care of all your troubles.

781
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:15,663
Okay? Huh?

782
00:53:15,663 --> 00:53:17,653
Okay? Deal?

783
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:21,553
Go inside and sleep.

784
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:23,553
Why?

785
00:53:23,553 --> 00:53:25,933
I'm going to sit here a little longer.

786
00:53:25,933 --> 00:53:27,323
Okay.

787
00:53:27,323 --> 00:53:31,383
I'll go ahead inside, then. Don't stay outside too long.

788
00:54:01,353 --> 00:54:05,693
 Just don't get caught by anyone. Especially Mom and Dad. 

789
00:54:05,693 --> 00:54:08,683
 Do you know how happy Mom and Dad were to hear you're getting married? 

790
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:12,383
 It'll hurt them the same whether you get caught or break it off at this point. 

791
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:16,733
 So, last all three years, no matter what, and get divorced quietly. 

792
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:19,453
 I know I'll sound really selfish. 

793
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:21,993
 But I'm really happy right now. 

794
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:28,133
 Thanks to you, I'm not feeling anxious for the first time. 

795
00:54:30,763 --> 00:54:32,993
Don't be conflicted, and

796
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:35,613
just trust your decision.

797
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:40,953
I think your decision is right, Na A Jeong.

798
00:54:46,223 --> 00:54:49,563
Did you decide to quit calling me Sister-in-law?

799
00:54:50,363 --> 00:54:51,933
Yes.

800
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:57,133
Regardless of what I call you, the fact that you'll become my sister-in-law won't change.

801
00:54:59,423 --> 00:55:01,393
That's nice.

802
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:06,043
At least you're consistent.

803
00:55:06,043 --> 00:55:09,533
But how can you be so certain?

804
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:13,553
You don't know what I'm conflicted about.

805
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,923
I don't care about anything else.

806
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:24,033
I just don't want you to waver, Na A Jeong.

807
00:55:24,033 --> 00:55:28,133
I heard my brother say he didn't feel anxious for the first time.

808
00:55:28,133 --> 00:55:31,243
But you'd feel anxious instead.

809
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:39,613
Regarding this marriage,

810
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:44,243
I've thought about everything that's been bothering me...

811
00:55:45,213 --> 00:55:47,813
one by one.

812
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:54,613
I can overlook everything else, but there's just one thing.

813
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:03,003
You still bother me, Lee Ji Han.

814
00:56:08,373 --> 00:56:12,553
I'm not really sure why I'm feeling this way.

815
00:56:17,303 --> 00:56:19,603
I just can't seem to overlook you.

816
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,453
I waver left and right.

817
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:33,153
So, I'm really going to ask you one last time.

818
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:40,293
Lee Ji Han, are you really okay...

819
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:44,053
with me marrying Do Han?

820
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,993
Can you really live with me being your sister-in-law?

821
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,433
Yes.

822
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:05,043
I'm also going to trust...

823
00:57:06,063 --> 00:57:08,053
my decision.

824
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:18,663
Right.

825
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:23,023
If I keep faking it like this, it'll become real one day.

826
00:58:25,053 --> 00:58:27,023
 Your wish won't come true if you throw them out. 

827
00:58:27,023 --> 00:58:30,683
 Keep them safe, and I hope your wish comes true. 

828
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:38,533
I think what you said was right, Unni.

829
00:58:38,533 --> 00:58:41,323
I'm jealous of A Jeong, who doesn't have to go through this anymore.

830
00:58:41,323 --> 00:58:42,903
What?

831
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:47,053
As expected, what you use to scratch an unscratched lottery ticket is important.

832
00:58:47,053 --> 00:58:50,323
Even if you lose the lottery, you'd still have the diamond coin, her conglomerate husband.

833
00:58:50,323 --> 00:58:51,733
So, she won the lottery in life.

834
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:54,593
Jong Hee, you don't know better.

835
00:58:54,593 --> 00:58:59,483
Even if you're using a dime, you need to scratch your own lottery ticket for the real fun.

836
00:58:59,483 --> 00:59:02,693
What's the fun in winning a lottery by scratching it with someone else's coin?

837
00:59:02,693 --> 00:59:05,643
Why? I think it'll be really fun.

838
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:09,443
I can't say for sure, but A Jeong's probably jealous of us right now.

839
00:59:09,443 --> 00:59:11,123
What?

840
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:15,223
Why do you think A Jeong worked so hard at her part-time jobs?

841
00:59:15,223 --> 00:59:17,803
It was to continue her acting career.

842
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:19,783
She thought she was finally free from worrying about money,

843
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:21,983
but her in-laws want her to quit everything and just have a good life.

844
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,873
Would that really be a good life for her?

845
00:59:23,873 --> 00:59:25,133
Of course it is!

846
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,803
Unni, don't you know the FIRE movement? 
  (Acronym for "Financial Independence, Retire Early") 

847
00:59:26,803 --> 00:59:30,163
Early retirement is young people's dreams these days.

848
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:35,493
You always draw a line between young and old whenever you're losing an argument.

849
00:59:35,493 --> 00:59:38,293
Also, if she was really bothered by it,

850
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:42,193
would A Jeong really go get her dress fitted with her fiancé?

851
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:54,853
This is way better than I thought, too.

852
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:57,263
This is really hard to choose.

853
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,563
Why be so picky? Just choose one.

854
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:02,543
How can we do that? It's still a wedding dress.

855
01:00:02,543 --> 01:00:05,823
Hey, I wore dresses every weekend.

856
01:00:05,823 --> 01:00:08,133
And I've got tens of ex-husbands.

857
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:09,403
Let's just choose one.

858
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:12,033
Let's take our time to try them on and choose.

859
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:15,943
You're the star of this wedding, you know.

860
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:38,593
 About this marriage... 

861
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,563
 I've thought about everything that's been bothering me... 

862
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,833
 one by one. 

863
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:49,073
 I can overlook everything else, but there's just one thing. 

864
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:54,263
 You still bother me, Lee Ji Han. 

865
01:00:56,883 --> 01:01:00,593
Pull yourself together, Na A Jeong.

866
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,883
 Lee Ji Han, are you really okay... 

867
01:01:21,853 --> 01:01:24,613
 with me marrying Do Han? 

868
01:01:35,573 --> 01:01:39,003
 Can you really live with me being your sister-in-law? 

869
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,933
- Lee Ji Han. 
 - Come outside.

870
01:02:18,243 --> 01:02:23,523
♫  The wind raises its hands and embraces my cheeks  ♫

871
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:28,973
♫  Shining like it's burning, all the perfect timing  ♫

872
01:02:28,973 --> 01:02:32,643
♫  A scent that fills the air  ♫

873
01:02:32,643 --> 01:02:37,783
♫  Over the skyline, dive down past it  ♫

874
01:02:37,783 --> 01:02:43,363
♫  I fly with you, azure feelings come blowing  ♫

875
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:48,943
♫  What do we do? A night filled with dreams  ♫

876
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:55,033
♫  Only you and I, in all the days and scenes containing you  ♫

877
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:57,783
♫  Butterflies are flying around  ♫

878
01:02:57,783 --> 01:03:01,353
♫  Butterflies are you and I, yeah  ♫

879
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,793
   

880
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:48,970


881
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:55,713
   

882
01:03:55,713 --> 01:03:57,983
 I'm not letting you go back to Brother. 

883
01:03:57,983 --> 01:04:00,023
 I don't know what happened between you two, 

884
01:04:00,023 --> 01:04:02,583
 but I'm letting it go because I trust A Jeong. 

885
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,813
 What will you do after confessing everything at this point? 

886
01:04:05,813 --> 01:04:08,493
 Do you really like my brother? 

887
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:13,323
 Stop barging into my life and interfering like this. 

888
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:15,643
 Aren't you embarrassed to live like that? 

889
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,603
 Is that really protecting me? 

890
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,473
 Aren't you just locking me up? 

891
01:04:19,473 --> 01:04:21,773
 Because I like Na A Jeong. 

892
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:24,253
 I don't think I can do this anymore. 

893
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:26,993
♫  I'm drowning, falling  ♫

894
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:31,461
♫  Oh, oh, yeah, to you  ♫
