1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,266
MODEL EMPLOYEE AWARDS

2
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,267
Great.

3
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,937
Congratulations.

4
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,231
You've won this three times already.

5
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,110
Yes, I'm really grateful
for the recognition.

6
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,071
But what happened to your nose?

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,869
I should know how to hold back,

8
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,621
but I can't stand injustice.

9
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,790
You're so cool.

10
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,833
You must be a model citizen too.

11
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,544
It's not just actors who act

12
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,505
-if you think about it.
-One, two.

13
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,257
-LJ, LJ, LJ!
-LJ, LJ, LJ!

14
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:34,178
Sometimes, ordinary people
have to act as well.

15
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:39,767
But one difference is that there are
no bloopers in real life.

16
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,817
What do you think?
Meddling without knowing your place.

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,276
Why did I do that?

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,362
Do-han. I'll do it.

19
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:52,947
I'll marry you.

20
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,990
I just became a cupid for them.

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,745
We don't have the ability
to take back our mistakes.

22
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:11,882
This is ordinary food,
and the river's always the same.

23
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,051
But this is nice.

24
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,143
We can't bring back precious memories.

25
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,520
It tastes different

26
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,355
from back then.

27
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,236
A-JUNG
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

28
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,446
And we can't go back to the past

29
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,616
and fix the scars that didn't heal right.

30
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,704
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
ABOUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY

31
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,123
But this place

32
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,542
might be able to help me.

33
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,133
My, this is...

34
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,217
It's bad, right?

35
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,015
Then can you scatter this?

36
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,814
Well...

37
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,357
This is bad too.

38
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,278
Then can you...

39
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,824
-Can you shake this--
-You're driving me crazy.

40
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,452
Will you ask me to do a sword dance too?

41
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,579
Then how about just one talisman?

42
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,875
Is there a talisman
that can take back something you said?

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,919
Just go on with the marriage.

44
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,962
The spirit tells me

45
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,382
you'll be loved by your husband.

46
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:39,136
That spirit told me I'd succeed last year.

47
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,681
And you said
it saw me receiving awards overseas.

48
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,224
This time, I'm sure.

49
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,728
And you'll have at least two children.

50
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,856
If you keep telling me lies,

51
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,733
I'll go to your channel.

52
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,945
I'll find the most viewed video
and comment

53
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,988
that you're a total fake.

54
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,033
Not BTS' New Year Horoscope video.

55
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:05,037
Why don't I ask the spirit again?

56
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,331
-Fine.
-Okay.

57
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,792
Let's see.

58
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,503
All right.

59
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,296
Let's see...

60
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,966
I can see it.

61
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,050
I can see it!

62
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,054
A rose.

63
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,932
With lots of thorns,

64
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,601
waiting for a butterfly.

65
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,270
Oh, no!

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,109
But it will meet a bee

67
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,279
and end up getting all its honey sucked.

68
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,364
Right?

69
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,451
I'll get exploited
and abandoned if I marry.

70
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,121
I knew it.

71
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,123
What do you mean?

72
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,207
Your husband's

73
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,084
the victim.

74
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,168
What?

75
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,712
You're the bee.

76
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,717
A very nasty bee at that.

77
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,891
But it's strange.

78
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:13,605
Why is the rose lying

79
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,815
like this?

80
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,615
What are you doing?

81
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,617
Choose.

82
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,952
Is it me or her?

83
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,457
What?

84
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,376
Don't be so childish.

85
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,878
Using age to attack me?

86
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,004
Seriously?

87
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,006
Oh, jeez.

88
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,052
That day, you said
you had something you wanted to hide too.

89
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,721
Does Na A-jung know what it is?

90
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,644
She does.
That's why you want to marry her.

91
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,772
Is she blackmailing you, then?

92
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,232
It's not that.

93
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,942
You're avoiding my eyes.

94
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,112
Go walk Terry if you're so bored.

95
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:04,865
Why change the subject?

96
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,077
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

97
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,623
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

98
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,000
On passing the audition

99
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,006
Honey, look at her face.
We totally got her!

100
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,511
She's good at acting, so she could be
pretending to be surprised.

101
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,056
A-jung, you have to get me
autographs of the actors.

102
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,768
Come on, honey.
A-jung might become the most famous soon.

103
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,061
You don't need them.

104
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,771
Auntie, come on.

105
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,606
Blow out the candles.

106
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,233
-Go on.
-Oh, right.

107
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,572
Congratulations!

108
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,991
-Are you crying?
-Congrats!

109
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,413
Hey, she's really crying.

110
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,250
I told you she gets touched
by stuff like this.

111
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,419
Thank you, guys.

112
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,839
You're the best.

113
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,424
-Great job.
-She's touched.

114
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,510
THE EMPRESS'S DREAM GROUP CHAT,
LEAVE CHAT

115
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,138
THE EMPRESS'S DREAM FD KIM DONG-HUN,
LEAVE CHAT

116
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,890
RICH DAUGHTER FD HAN CHEON-YEONG,
LEAVE CHAT

117
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,934
RICH DAUGHTER GROUP CHAT,
LEAVE CHAT

118
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,687
She got in through her connections, right?

119
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,730
Using my connections?

120
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,274
When?

121
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,044
A-jung.

122
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,053
-Are you crying?
-No.

123
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,346
Why would I cry?

124
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,474
My eyes are teary because of the cold.

125
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,228
Why did you come out?

126
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,691
Here.

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,818
What is this?

128
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,236
My emergency fund.

129
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,826
If you ever have coffee
with all the staff, you should buy once.

130
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:19,416
Being good at acting is important, but
so is being in your coworkers' good books.

131
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,500
It's fine.

132
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,713
Buying coffee once won't help anyway.

133
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,759
Well, keep it just in case.

134
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,761
-Don't let Su-jung see.
-Gosh.

135
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,015
My eyes hurt.

136
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,391
Do your best.

137
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,726
All right?

138
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,979
And you can quit whenever you want
if it's too tough.

139
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,398
Don't say that.

140
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,694
You should tell me
to fight it and keep going. You're my mom.

141
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:48,737
I mean...

142
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,659
You don't need to cling to anything
so desperately.

143
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,993
I get it.

144
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,078
You know,

145
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,997
it's fine to take a different path
in the middle.

146
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,374
That's a path too.

147
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,418
It's better than suffering.

148
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,922
Finding another path isn't easy.

149
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,509
Only those who reached it can see it.

150
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,305
Others may say
you're only doing minor roles,

151
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,558
but to me and your dad,

152
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,773
you're always the star of the show.
Don't forget that, okay?

153
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,448
It's not a baby, right?

154
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,078
-Are you mad?
-What a relief.

155
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,746
Then it's fine.

156
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,998
How can you think--

157
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,499
How can I think of that?

158
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,085
Then just tell me what it is.

159
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,505
-It's not that.
-Are you sure?

160
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,966
If you're not telling me

161
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,096
something that's serious,
it's the same as lying to me.

162
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,559
You really shouldn't lie to me, Do-han.

163
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,478
I would have no one to trust.

164
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,689
That'd really suck.

165
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,693
You're really not

166
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,778
hiding anything?

167
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,431
NA A-JUNG

168
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,433
A-jung?

169
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,226
Hello?

170
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,228
Right now?

171
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,731
It's fine. I'll go now.

172
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,441
Okay.

173
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,984
Go? Go where?

174
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,362
Let's talk later, okay?

175
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,287
You're going to her?

176
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,498
You can't. I won't let you.

177
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,876
Now I have to ask you this.
Why do you hate her so much?

178
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,046
She's just using you to get back at me.

179
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,840
Hey, she's not like you.

180
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,552
Are you taking her side?
I'm your brother, you know.

181
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,929
Just move.

182
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,515
No.

183
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,352
Fine. Then I'm sorry.

184
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,113
He seriously

185
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,280
stepped on me?

186
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,663
LJ GROUP'S SUCCESSOR LEE DO-HAN

187
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,706
What?

188
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,708
What? Ji-ae!

189
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,793
Look at this.

190
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,673
"LJ Group's successor Lee Do-han"?

191
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,927
"Living in New York. Entered Korea
for Chairman Hyun's birthday"?

192
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,306
Isn't this guy
the one A-jung was talking about?

193
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,893
You mean he's that friend
who proposed to her?

194
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,019
Yes.

195
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,354
I told you.

196
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,481
How could she be friends with him?

197
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,692
-But--
-That's impossible.

198
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,694
Welcome...

199
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,195
Hey, Jong-hee.

200
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,614
Hello.

201
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,908
I'll have an iced caffe latte.

202
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,368
What about you?

203
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,996
Can I have a warm Earl Grey tea?

204
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,581
Sure.

205
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,085
Is that him?

206
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,172
-Is it him?
-Yes, I'm sure!

207
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,262
Right, she was totally wrong about kids.

208
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,599
Why do you go there, then?

209
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,267
I'm not sure.

210
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:54,149
Since it's cheaper than counseling
and easier to approach than a hospital?

211
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:56,902
I get sleepy

212
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,321
even with coffee,

213
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,239
but it wakes me for a while.

214
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,325
That's what it's like.

215
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,161
I know it won't change anything,

216
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,914
but my thoughts get organized for a while.

217
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,040
So,

218
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,043
what's the result?

219
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,586
Here.

220
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,673
You said I'm the only one who can help.

221
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,675
You won't regret it?

222
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,677
You didn't want to do it.

223
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,597
I thought it over, and it won't be so bad.

224
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,558
I'll be the female lead.

225
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,061
And for once in my life,

226
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,189
I want to be someone

227
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,525
who's really needed.

228
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,654
I want to try a role that's important.

229
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,698
A role only I can do.

230
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,619
And that's what you suggested.

231
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,748
A-jung.

232
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,169
If I hold your hand now,
we're really getting married.

233
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,381
You can think--

234
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,590
I've already

235
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,133
done enough thinking.

236
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,434
I'm going to take a new path with you.

237
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,064
Only I know the path
because I've walked this far,

238
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,609
so I'll decide whether
to regret it at the end.

239
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,625
EPISODE 3

240
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,294
Sir.

241
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,673
There has been severe backlash
from the shareholders

242
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,593
after the announcement.

243
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,389
I understand what you're saying.

244
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,852
I'll rethink the succession.

245
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,979
Happy?

246
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:02,193
But I'm still planning
on teaching him work again.

247
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,322
For starters, how about

248
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,199
getting him to work on

249
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,951
the Myeongju shopping mall?

250
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,954
There are serious issues regarding

251
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,291
the Bangkok shopping mall
scheduled to open next year.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,252
The completion date we promised

253
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,338
is getting postponed.

254
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,300
If any problems occur because of this...

255
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,804
Then my brother Do-han
could end up taking the fall.

256
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,556
Is that what you mean?

257
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,603
The groundbreaking ceremony
was pushed again?

258
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,690
I got my nose broken and stepped on,

259
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,819
but Do-han and A-jung are still together.

260
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,240
Yes, and I guess it's serious this time,

261
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,951
judging by the way

262
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,663
you're lying sick in bed.

263
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,208
The logic of life

264
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,127
is that you can't always be happy.

265
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,631
You suffer at one point in your life.

266
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,842
When that moment comes, think of me.

267
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,261
I've immediately

268
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,682
begun thinking of her.

269
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,895
I got you some porridge,
so make sure to eat it.

270
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,233
I'll get going.

271
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,215
NA A-JUNG

272
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,093
The person you are calling is unavailable.

273
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,266
I'm sure she'll turn up at some point.

274
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,937
I won't give up so easily.

275
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,830
-Is it you?
-What?

276
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,332
Well, aren't you here to buy a used item?

277
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,793
I don't do that.

278
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,463
Oh, it's not you. Sorry.

279
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,340
I thought you were buying my kid's mat.

280
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,467
I don't have a kid.

281
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,551
Right.

282
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,179
Let's go, Ji-oh.

283
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,976
Dad, why is he sitting there
in front of our house

284
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,604
when he's not buying this?

285
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,109
Excuse me.

286
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,236
On second thought,

287
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,197
I'm here to buy

288
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,115
your mat.

289
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,002
There's Poli and Amber too.

290
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,588
What?

291
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,632
How did you get in?

292
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,844
Well, this man
opened the door and let me in.

293
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,388
Oh, he's here to buy Ji-oh's mat.

294
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,183
He wanted to check the state,
so he came in.

295
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,894
You came here to buy a Robocar Poli mat?

296
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,313
The size is perfect for my living room.

297
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,857
Do you two know each other?

298
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,026
No, not at all. Never.

299
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,571
Enjoy the mat, then.

300
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,991
A-jung, are you shooting today?

301
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,662
-What... I...
-Hey, we need to talk.

302
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,541
Are you okay?

303
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,126
Why did you step on Poli?

304
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,211
Come outside.

305
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,341
Don't they know you quit that job?

306
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,927
Trying to meddle in my family affairs too?

307
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,762
Stay out of this.

308
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:03,059
You told me to come out.
Aren't we going to talk?

309
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,811
Damn it.

310
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,985
Start your car. Hurry.

311
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,570
What?

312
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,737
My mom's coming.

313
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,160
She said she'd go to my aunt's.
Why's she back already?

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,081
Anyway, if she sees me,
she'll notice I quit.

315
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,708
So they don't know.

316
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,003
So hurry up.
I'll talk with you, so just go.

317
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,348
By the way, what's with
those rumors, Chae-won?

318
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,310
Are you really marrying that guy?

319
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,688
You mean Lee Do-han? From LJ?

320
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,274
The handsome one?

321
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,650
He's handsome,

322
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,027
but it's not true.

323
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,403
We're just friends.

324
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,738
And his little brother?

325
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,450
Why do you ask?
Are there rumors about him too?

326
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,618
Don't you know?

327
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,661
Everyone knows about them.

328
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,165
Older one runs from blind dates,
younger one keeps setting them up.

329
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,793
He was obsessed with trying to find
a decent girl for him.

330
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,046
They were both born out of wedlock.

331
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,965
The older brother
isn't even interested, though.

332
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,133
That's crazy.

333
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,135
I've heard of mothers like that

334
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,387
but never of brothers that eager.

335
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,474
It's a relief you're not marrying him.

336
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,184
She's out of his league.

337
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:30,271
Right. She's inheriting way more than him.

338
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,023
You deserve better.

339
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,858
-Of course.
-Right.

340
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,151
I agree.

341
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,157
I'm sorry. Reservations are full today,

342
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,284
so you'll have to wait.

343
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,453
Didn't you make a reservation?

344
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,497
Don't you know her?

345
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,874
You're making her wait?

346
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,127
No need to apologize. It's my fault.
It's fine.

347
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,546
Thank you.

348
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,714
Heard that?

349
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,091
Who wants to wait?

350
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,300
Wait?

351
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,677
We made reservations.

352
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,179
I know. Who will wait instead of me?

353
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:08,476
Why are you surprised?
Why should I wait while you go in?

354
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,228
I'm richer than you.

355
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,522
-Chae-won.
-Will you wait?

356
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,651
Right, you should.
I have much more to inherit than you.

357
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,486
What about you?

358
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,030
Your mother's the second wife.

359
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,994
Shouldn't you get on my good side
to challenge the first wife's kids?

360
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,245
Yoon Chae-won!

361
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,454
Why?

362
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,622
Are you upset?

363
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,542
Then don't talk about others

364
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,877
so easily.

365
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,799
What's with her?

366
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,134
-Is she mad?
-What?

367
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,218
Unbelievable.

368
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,053
-What was that?
-She's crazy.

369
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,776
What's that?

370
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,194
Trying to hit me?

371
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,279
If necessary.

372
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,699
There's no one around,

373
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,661
and it's the perfect spot
for you to bury me.

374
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,581
I need something to protect myself.

375
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,207
You watched too many TV shows.

376
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,417
Whatever.

377
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,962
Why did you drag me all the way here?

378
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,673
Where are we?

379
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,009
Use your brain

380
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,428
and look around, will you?

381
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:35,313
"LJ Group's new shopping mall site"?

382
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,025
I'm sorry about that day.
It was a mistake.

383
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,945
You said you shouldn't touch
a savings account.

384
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,074
This is my savings account.

385
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,910
I worked on this without any help

386
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,579
from my family since I was an intern.

387
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,457
It'll be owned by the city in 30 years,

388
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,585
but my grandfather wanted
to put Do-han in charge.

389
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,254
It's over now,

390
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,883
but there's hope.

391
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,676
If you take back your word

392
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,096
and if Chae-won marries him,

393
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,347
it'll all be fixed.

394
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,390
Apologize properly.

395
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,934
What?

396
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,478
I didn't hear you properly.

397
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,564
Apologize properly to me again.

398
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,152
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,073
I made a mistake that day.

400
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,616
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,410
My hearing's bad. I didn't hear you.

402
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,495
What did you say?

403
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,666
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,043
Maybe you're standing

405
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,963
too far away. I still can't hear you.

406
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,673
Come closer and say it.

407
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,140
I...

408
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,808
I'm really sorry.

409
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,643
What did you say?

410
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,526
I'm sorry.

411
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,612
Finally apologizing properly.

412
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,489
But too bad.

413
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,324
It's already too late.

414
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,619
No matter how many times you apologize,

415
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,164
I've already decided to marry Do-han.

416
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,253
My mom was right, by the way.

417
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,548
You grow so small when you're anxious.

418
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,802
What was that?

419
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,262
Playing with me?

420
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,430
And just leaving?

421
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,861
You're walking?

422
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,613
Get in.

423
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,199
Lee Ji-han!

424
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,451
You! You little...

425
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,494
Hello, sir. What brings you here?

426
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,205
-How are you?
-I...

427
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,125
You ignored my calls
as soon as you got my stamp,

428
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,376
and what now?

429
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,921
How shameless. How dare you come here!

430
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,005
Shall I go?

431
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,506
I will. I'll be back.

432
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,926
Where do you think you're going?

433
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,636
You're dead.

434
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,429
-Father!
-How could you do that?

435
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,680
-How?
-Father!

436
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,848
How could you?

437
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,350
What? Wait!

438
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,976
-Wait!
-What's going on?

439
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,061
What is all this?

440
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,479
What are you doing?

441
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,730
Why would you...

442
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,233
What?

443
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:31,197
-What?
-That's my wife's friend.

444
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,580
You're Ji-eun's friend.
You sang at our wedding.

445
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,207
Oh, right.

446
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,833
-Yes.
-Hello.

447
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,001
-Ji-eun's husband?
-Yes.

448
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,212
Father, she sang at our wedding.

449
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,296
Hello, sir.

450
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,381
-I see!
-Hello.

451
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,465
It's her.

452
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,218
It's not much, but enjoy.

453
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,096
Ji-eun's friend is the same as family.

454
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,808
This is a feast. It's amazing.

455
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,892
Are you a chef?

456
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,607
By the way,

457
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,151
how did you end up coming here?

458
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,154
I was running an errand,

459
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,324
and your husband recognized me.

460
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,576
-What a surprise.
-Really?

461
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,661
Yes.

462
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,121
That's amazing. Enjoy.

463
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,707
Why are you glaring at her

464
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,792
like that?

465
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,920
It seems suspicious.

466
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,966
Is she really your sister-in-law?

467
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,803
My dear brother-in-law.

468
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,138
Try this meat.

469
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,349
It melts in your mouth.

470
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,026
Play along if you don't want
your hair pulled out again, okay?

471
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,865
Try the crabs, my dear sister-in-law.

472
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,200
-It's tasty.
-Great.

473
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,078
You know exactly what I like.

474
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,414
-Goodness.
-Oh, no.

475
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,082
-Are you okay?
-It's fine.

476
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,835
-Tissue...
-Sorry about that.

477
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,379
Here.

478
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,214
Oh, no.

479
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,300
Hey.

480
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,261
You got something on your mouth.

481
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,267
How kind of you.

482
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,061
Wiping your pants, then my mouth.

483
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,772
My kindness is unbiased.

484
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,570
Right.

485
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,995
They're all my favorites.

486
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,499
I missed your food the most in New York.

487
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,960
How can you live abroad
when you love Korean food?

488
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,547
Can't you just live here?

489
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:58,552
I mean, you're trying to marry
that girl who ate two bowls of soup.

490
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,306
She even ate all the fish clean.

491
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,351
Do-han.

492
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,561
You might want to leave,

493
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,356
but I feel sorry for Ji-han
living here alone.

494
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,692
Why is everyone telling me about him?

495
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,362
I can barely take care of myself.

496
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,410
That reporter came here several times

497
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,078
to see Ji-han,

498
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,830
but only met the chairman.

499
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:26,956
It's obvious.

500
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,582
He was here for money.

501
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,086
So don't blame Ji-han.

502
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,548
His condition gets worse
whenever it rains.

503
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:40,302
If you hate him too,
Ji-han won't have a sunny day in his life.

504
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,890
Don't tell my grandfather I came.

505
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:49,979
What's your deal?

506
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,481
Are you both frauds?

507
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,651
She was dramatic at the wedding.

508
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,322
This must be why. Did you find me again

509
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,074
-to blackmail me?
-Blackmail?

510
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,617
Aren't you her friend?

511
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,870
Not at all.

512
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,956
She pretended to be
my friend at my wedding.

513
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,170
Anyway, I paid her, and our deal
included her keeping it a secret.

514
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,047
If you try to do anything funny

515
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,425
in front of my family,

516
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,385
I'm going to report you.

517
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,807
What?

518
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,559
You didn't know?

519
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,227
She's your sister-in-law.

520
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,902
You should be careful too.

521
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,613
That means she's deceiving you as well.

522
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,715
You don't believe me?

523
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,967
That's nonsense.

524
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,136
I'm telling the truth.

525
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,514
I've looked down on people many times,

526
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,432
but I've never seen

527
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,852
a super-rich person
attacking a less rich one.

528
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,521
Maybe you were mistaken.

529
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:17,024
Chae-won attacked her friends
over something like that?

530
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,278
They bad-mouthed Ji-han and Do-han,

531
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,197
mentioning their birth.

532
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,824
But they said she deserved better.

533
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,327
Now they think she has feelings for him.

534
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,662
Gossip's going to spread.

535
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,413
I guess I can understand,

536
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,291
but her liking Ji-han?

537
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,044
I'm quick when it comes to these things.

538
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,506
I'm the first one who got wind
of my husband's arrest.

539
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,467
Why would Chae-won ever like Ji-han?

540
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:46,011
It seems you're mistaken this time.

541
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,764
People's hearts are easy to read.

542
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,891
It's so obvious.

543
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,851
When she looked at Do-han,

544
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,812
her eyes had no sparkles.

545
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,231
So who would she have feelings for

546
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,024
between those two?

547
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,109
You're wrong.

548
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:01,819
Seung-a.

549
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,488
Let's go inside.

550
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,532
I think you're just hungry.

551
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,576
You need food therapy.

552
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,660
Come.

553
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,663
Teaming up and mocking me?

554
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,831
You brats.

555
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,466
Why do you work so hard?

556
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,677
How cute.

557
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,139
Hardly anyone uses
the emergency stairs anyway.

558
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,434
Well, Mr. Lee wants the footage urgently.

559
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,354
I think I found it.

560
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:41,942
What?

561
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,445
Was Ms. Na

562
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,155
a bully or something

563
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,781
in the past?

564
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,714
You're not even real friends.

565
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,759
How much about you is a lie?

566
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,719
It's acting, not lying.

567
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:13,015
You should act properly too.
You were being so awkward.

568
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,142
Your act will end if I tell them.

569
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,644
I'm sure

570
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,187
you won't be able to.

571
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,731
You'll be in a tight spot too.

572
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,901
You little...

573
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:24,985
What?

574
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,071
Hey!

575
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,947
He really is here!

576
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,033
Hey, give us back our land.

577
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,827
You said you'd build a department store.

578
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,329
Why isn't it happening?

579
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,956
It's been empty for years.

580
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,001
This entire neighborhood is all dead now.

581
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,379
Please calm down and listen--

582
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,923
You've ignored our calls until now!

583
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,343
Just give us back our land, got that?

584
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:53,222
We won't let you leave
until you give us back our land.

585
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,724
Everyone, be quiet.

586
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,023
We're in the same boat.

587
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,443
I'll help you, so you help me too.

588
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,408
Where are you going?

589
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,492
District office.

590
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,910
At this hour?

591
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,496
Everyone's gathered there right now.

592
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,789
Hurry.

593
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,712
If you have any questions,

594
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,506
raise your hand, and I'll answer anything.

595
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,550
Me.

596
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:31,802
She's 365 Mart.

597
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,095
Owner of 365 Mart?

598
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,638
Go ahead.

599
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,849
LJ scammed us, didn't they?

600
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,726
Of course not.

601
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,480
I even saw a large bridge being built
on the way here today.

602
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:46,358
And the bus terminal is being renovated.

603
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,945
The car center owner?

604
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,364
That has nothing to do with LJ!

605
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,699
It does.

606
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,411
It's all being done
with the money LJ donated.

607
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,079
How else could it be paid?

608
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:06,253
What's more, the department store
will be owned by your city in 30 years?

609
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,796
Did you know that?

610
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,717
It'll increase tax revenue,

611
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,304
which means Myeongju
is already developing.

612
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,513
Well,

613
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:19,016
if it's such a good thing,

614
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,228
why didn't this guy
answer any of our calls?

615
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,938
And he stopped coming here!

616
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,733
Yes! He wants
all the benefits for himself.

617
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,901
No! Of course not.

618
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:29,985
Everyone,

619
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,198
I've learned
that no news isn't always good news.

620
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,994
Mr. Lee told me not to tell people...

621
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,329
What is it?

622
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,081
Just tell us everything!

623
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,333
It's fine, tell us.

624
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,460
-Go on!
-Tell us!

625
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,003
All right.

626
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,797
Actually, Mr. Lee here

627
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,674
got into a car accident recently.

628
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,759
An accident?

629
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:54,968
-An accident?
-Oh, no.

630
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,519
He hasn't even recovered fully yet,

631
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,731
but he said
he had to come here and dragged me along.

632
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:13,320
He told me
that this place was everything for him.

633
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,240
That it was like his savings account.

634
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,535
This is my savings account.

635
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,371
But he didn't want you all

636
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,039
to find out he was hurt

637
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,959
and get worried and anxious,

638
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,504
so we were going to quietly
check the area and go.

639
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,631
But now you know everything.

640
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,550
You should have told us, then!

641
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,718
Are you okay now?

642
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,928
Yes, I'm okay.

643
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,721
-Oh, dear.
-So everyone,

644
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:43,725
if he really wanted
everything for himself,

645
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,936
would he have worried

646
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,397
about that?

647
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,817
I don't think I would.

648
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,735
-True.
-She's right.

649
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:56,697
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,157
Since you're holding that, sing for us.

651
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,367
What should I sing?

652
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,286
Pardon?

653
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,331
The song "Oh My!"?

654
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,291
Yes!

655
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,257
Stand up, everyone!

656
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,553
She's like some cult leader.

657
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,853
Oh, my! Oh, my!
Don't do this

658
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:32,316
A woman's heart is fickle

659
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,526
Why are you doing this

660
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,737
Don't ask

661
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:42,075
Don't ask any more from me

662
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,329
I only met you today...

663
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,302
Indigestion? You didn't even eat much.

664
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,434
It's strange to be able
to digest right now.

665
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,186
It's all acting.

666
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:11,813
It's not easy

667
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,274
to do method acting.

668
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,956
I don't do this for just anyone,

669
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,583
but I need my driver to go to Seoul.

670
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,878
Thank you for today.

671
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,464
You know how to thank people?

672
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,841
And I'm sorry

673
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,387
about getting you that role.

674
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,682
I didn't think that you'd be

675
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,977
taking someone's chance away.

676
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,356
And I didn't think

677
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,234
that you'd feel hurt.

678
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,701
You don't need to apologize.

679
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,081
I didn't apologize to you either.

680
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,838
Your dream must have been
important to you too.

681
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:24,136
I know I ruined your plans.

682
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,307
And that we're doing things
that we shouldn't.

683
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,395
But I won't apologize.

684
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,814
Because of Do-han?

685
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,192
Yes, so just keep hating me.

686
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,403
I'll do the same.

687
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,033
That would be better for us.

688
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,019
Terry.

689
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,272
Ji-han must be crazy.

690
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,535
So how was Do-han?

691
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,541
What?

692
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,043
How did I know?

693
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,921
This is my house.

694
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,216
I know everything going on here.

695
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,176
I'm sorry, sir.

696
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,470
And in my house,

697
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,266
I don't want people hearing things
that I haven't said.

698
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,435
Yes, sir.

699
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,646
All right.

700
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,743
Mr. Hyun, it's Reporter Kang Ik-jun.

701
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,329
I wanted to know if you were doing well.

702
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,930
He's ignoring me?

703
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:33,557
What?

704
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,350
It's nothing.

705
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,189
By the way,
will we even get anything by waiting here?

706
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,567
We will. Definitely.

707
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,778
I did this for 20 years,
and I never failed.

708
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,447
But they said it wasn't true.

709
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,866
If they say

710
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,243
it's not true, it is.

711
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,163
And if they say it's true, it isn't.

712
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,332
It could really be true,
and really be wrong.

713
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,672
See that?

714
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,383
Just as I expected.

715
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,052
This is why I can't give up.

716
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:22,856
This looks good.

717
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,236
What is it?

718
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,239
Is it your first time eating it?

719
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,200
I've had it before.

720
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,453
But you never asked to meet before.

721
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,335
Do you like Ji-han?

722
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,794
What do you mean?

723
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,172
That's ridiculous.

724
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,632
No, it's not.

725
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:52,135
I thought about it, and it was always him.

726
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,890
I overheard Se-jin saying
that you had a fight to defend Ji-han.

727
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,893
They were gossiping about him.

728
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,853
People always gossip.

729
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,147
Just ignore them.

730
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,650
It'll just cause rumors.

731
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,448
But Ji-han will be touched.

732
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,492
You were his first love.

733
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,247
Don't move.

734
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,332
If you move,

735
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,960
they'll see I'm watching.

736
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,633
How did you know
reporters were tailing us?

737
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,470
How did I not notice before?

738
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,139
Do you know them?

739
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,224
Yes.

740
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,059
Too well.

741
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:43,979
Let's just eat.

742
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,779
FORBES WORLD'S 100 MOST POWERFUL WOMEN,
CEO Y, DATING FAMOUS GROUP'S HEIR L?

743
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,867
It's a lame company

744
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,703
that releases gossip.

745
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,748
I wonder why they met alone.

746
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,126
It's nothing.

747
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,337
What? What happened to positive thinking?

748
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,672
There's no use.

749
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,051
Na A-jung is intent
on marrying my brother.

750
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,971
This upsets me more.

751
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,890
A photo of them together
in a lame article.

752
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,309
Who's the reporter?

753
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,393
Hang on.

754
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,729
Here it is.

755
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,022
It's Kang Ik-jun.

756
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,859
Who?

757
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,112
He was involved
in Hyun Su-hyeon's accident.

758
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,742
Oh, right.

759
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,286
Right!

760
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,457
How did I not remember his name
at that moment?

761
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,208
Darn it.

762
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,419
What a jerk.

763
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,881
He was chasing Hyun Su-hyeon years ago,

764
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,258
and now he's after her son?

765
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,351
-It seems like it didn't work out again.
-Yeah.

766
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:08,730
I looked up the TV show she told us,
and her name wasn't there.

767
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,900
With A-jung's personality,

768
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,777
she probably can't tell us

769
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,029
after she bragged so much.

770
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:20,033
But we can't keep pretending not to know.

771
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,828
Who will ask her this time?

772
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,290
I asked when she broke up.

773
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,875
Okay, pass.

774
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:33,088
I asked when she got fired before that.

775
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,048
Okay. Pass.

776
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,551
I told you what happened
with the used item deal.

777
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:40,845
Then it's you.

778
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,430
Do we have to ask her?

779
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,517
I can play dumb

780
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,728
and wait until A-jung tells us first.

781
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,855
How will you play dumb?

782
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,150
You're the worst at acting
among all of us.

783
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:58,905
You'll make it obvious
and just hurt her pride more.

784
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,156
She's right.

785
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,700
A-jung said herself that her acting skills

786
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,203
-had nothing to do with his genes.
-Right.

787
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:06,830
Jeez.

788
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,164
She's so annoying.

789
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:11,543
Why do we have to walk on eggshells
when she got fired?

790
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,634
What are you doing?

791
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,802
Hey.

792
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:21,970
We're

793
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,263
just eating fruit.

794
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:25,807
There's no fruit.

795
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:27,517
What?

796
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,185
Well, you're all gathered.

797
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,399
I had something to say to you all.

798
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,860
I see.

799
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:40,488
All right.

800
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,450
We're ready. Just say it.

801
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,413
-Mom.
-Yes?

802
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,039
Dad.

803
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,083
Su-jung.

804
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:53,710
Tae-min.

805
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:55,795
And Ji-oh.

806
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,843
I'm getting married.

807
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,764
What?

808
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,266
What?

809
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,601
So suddenly?

810
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:17,984
A-jung?

811
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,570
You know we're indoors, right?

812
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,155
And it's a semi-basement.

813
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,239
I know.

814
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,952
Then what's with those sunglasses?
And the outfit?

815
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:30,705
I hear reporters are tailing you.

816
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,667
That means I could get photographed
with you today.

817
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:36,544
Are they here?

818
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,089
Where are they?

819
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,050
It's not that kind of reporter.

820
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,927
It's really exhausting.

821
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,011
I know.

822
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,723
But I've never
been photographed for an article before.

823
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:54,771
It might be the reporter that photographed
you and that woman on the Forbes list.

824
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,189
It's so cool.

825
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,443
But it's not just that.

826
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,612
I just wanted to dress up once

827
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,072
looking like an actress

828
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,074
to negotiate a contract.

829
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,705
Did you read it?

830
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,624
Yes. It was clear.

831
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:15,875
Was it?

832
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,126
-But...
-Yes?

833
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,836
The fifth clause here.

834
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,921
Yes.

835
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,091
I want to revise
the reason for our divorce.

836
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,929
Isn't "personality differences"
the most common reason?

837
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,013
No,

838
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:31,599
I want it to be me that wants it.

839
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:32,684
Not me?

840
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,269
Yes. Think about it.

841
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,480
You have money, a car, and a company.

842
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,984
Plus, you were going to marry
someone better.

843
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,902
So if you end it,

844
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,029
what would people think?

845
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:48,700
They'll say people should marry
those from the same status.

846
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,618
But still,

847
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,495
they'll pity you for it.

848
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:53,997
I don't want that.

849
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,794
I'd rather be a hell of a woman
who dumped a rich guy than get pitied.

850
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,005
Revise this.

851
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,299
No "sympathy."

852
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,301
No "sympathy."

853
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,927
Write "a hell of a woman."

854
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,679
And this part.

855
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,766
About providing incentives
for ancestral rites.

856
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,602
I want this taken out.

857
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:18,855
I know I'm acting,
but it doesn't feel right

858
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,064
to get paid for it.

859
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,194
But action scenes
are dangerous, so I'd like

860
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,697
additional fees paid for that.

861
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,198
What action scenes?

862
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,575
Write this down.

863
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,910
Having to get a new identity

864
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:36,289
and fleeing to another country.

865
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,837
Or having to get stabbed
due to various conflicts.

866
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,673
That won't happen.

867
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,717
And we have to be PG-15.

868
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,722
I'm okay with holding hands and hugging.
And a little bit of cuddling.

869
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:57,810
But if it gets any higher than that,
you'll have to find a different actress.

870
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,103
Keep that in mind.

871
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:02,690
That's it.

872
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,400
-Right.
-I guess we're done.

873
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,526
All right.

874
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,611
Here.

875
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:09,072
Just sign here.

876
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,789
-Deal?
-Deal.

877
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,668
Let's go and get prepared.

878
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:23,503
Right.

879
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,982
You wanted to live in New York.

880
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,611
But to do that,
your grandpa needs to give up on you.

881
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,784
Wouldn't that be better
than trying to get his permission?

882
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,078
You mean

883
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,623
we'll keep making him oppose us?

884
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,500
You're so smart.

885
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,002
An elopement.

886
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:06,963
That's our concept.

887
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,636
They're simple and pretty.

888
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,929
They are.

889
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,807
Can we take the rings today
if we buy them?

890
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,561
If you make an order,
we'll prepare them as soon as possible.

891
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:26,983
Then can you show us rings
that we can take right away?

892
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,277
-Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

893
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,740
What about other family members?

894
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,534
You have other siblings.

895
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,413
Well, they hate
even being in the same room as me.

896
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,540
So they'll probably hate you too.

897
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,500
I'm sure they'll welcome me.

898
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,086
-Why?
-They hate you,

899
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:52,341
so they'll welcome someone
who isn't the woman your grandpa wanted.

900
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,596
We're all okay with that woman
Do-han's bringing, right?

901
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,389
Seung-a.

902
00:50:58,473 --> 00:50:59,766
Of course.

903
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:04,854
He's marrying her instead of Chae-won.
It's much better.

904
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,731
Honey.

905
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,485
I'll give my permission just this once,

906
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:14,530
so just compliment her
and say she's pretty.

907
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:16,991
I don't really want to compliment

908
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,785
someone other than you,

909
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:19,952
but I'll try.

910
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:21,913
I know.

911
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,624
I understand how you feel.

912
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:28,127
Just think of it as acting, all right?

913
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,295
-Seung-a.
-Yes?

914
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,338
You're really...

915
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,840
You're...

916
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,134
I can't do it.

917
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,304
Well, I'm quite pretty.

918
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,097
Why are you so pretty?

919
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,308
I was just born pretty.

920
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,101
They won't really

921
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,770
like me anyway.

922
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,524
They have motive,
so I don't need to mind them.

923
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,443
What about this?

924
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,363
This one looks prettier.

925
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,656
-Really?
-Yes.

926
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:57,740
Not too boring?

927
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:58,908
No, it's pretty.

928
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,576
The other one's better.

929
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,454
Let's work on our history.

930
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:04,372
Our history?

931
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,873
Yes.

932
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:09,585
We'd been friends,
then dated about five years ago,

933
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:13,673
but it didn't really go well
because of the long distance.

934
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,842
And we felt sparks again recently.

935
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:17,927
How is it?

936
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,346
You're writing a whole novel.

937
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:24,559
Hey, scripts are crucial for acting.

938
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:27,979
I'll take this.

939
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,730
Okay. It's pretty.

940
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,992
-I'll buy both dresses.
-Yes, sir.

941
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,958
What are you doing here?

942
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,459
I came for you.

943
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,011
They're filming something.

944
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,638
You know anyone there?

945
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:06,976
No.

946
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:08,728
Let's go.

947
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:20,156
What is it? Anything else you want to see?

948
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,074
No. Let's go.

949
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:26,871
I saw the photo.

950
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:32,001
You refused when I begged you to meet him.
What happened?

951
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:33,753
It's nothing.

952
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,422
I just helped him with something.

953
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,176
You two meeting up is a big deal for me.

954
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,139
Remember how I even got you on a plane
to make you meet?

955
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:46,974
Oh, right.

956
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:50,561
He tried to talk to that rookie,
and her manager warned him.

957
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:52,104
-Really?
-Don't laugh.

958
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,815
The other actress was much prettier.

959
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,776
And she was cool.

960
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,819
Wonder what she's doing.

961
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,864
Why don't you send her a message, then?

962
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:02,949
Should I?

963
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,450
She'll probably reply.

964
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,576
Bring the script!

965
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,827
Okay!

966
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,497
I'm sorry.

967
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,001
Chae-won.

968
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,628
Do you know what I hate?

969
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:17,880
Not doing things

970
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,174
properly.

971
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,258
Whether it's work

972
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,136
or apologizing.

973
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:35,940
Are you okay?

974
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,817
You should be careful.

975
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,360
Sorry.

976
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,080
Are you okay?

977
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,581
I'm fine.

978
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,917
Are you okay?

979
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,587
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

980
00:54:58,671 --> 00:54:59,672
On purpose?

981
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,216
Of course not.

982
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,805
Who are you to make me have such regrets?

983
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,441
I apologized,

984
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,609
so you apologize too

985
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,238
to that pretty and cool woman.

986
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,369
Whatever it is, I'm sorry. Happy?

987
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,252
Stop it.

988
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,420
I'm fine.

989
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,101
Lee Do-han.

990
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,729
I'm asking you for the last time.

991
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,067
You're really giving it all up?

992
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,612
I mean, I've only had a glimpse

993
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:08,032
of all this wealth,
and it's beyond my expectations.

994
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,035
You really won't regret it?

995
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:12,703
I won't.

996
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:14,455
Okay, then.

997
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,751
Well, I'm all dressed up. Let's do this.

998
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,004
You have plans for this?

999
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,464
Of course.

1000
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,883
I prepared three types they'd hate.

1001
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:31,680
Eat up, Honey.

1002
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,349
You're the best.

1003
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,434
-You eat up too.
-Okay.

1004
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,438
If we try too hard, it might look obvious.

1005
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:42,483
We have to pretend to be shy and awkward.

1006
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:48,531
"I want to get on your good side,
but that will be impossible." Why?

1007
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:51,992
Rolled omelette.

1008
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,538
Old people never like picky eaters.

1009
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,540
I don't like beans.

1010
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,711
It's fine. Enjoy.

1011
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,381
Enjoy.

1012
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,970
Fish.

1013
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,054
Enjoy your meal.

1014
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:13,139
Wait.

1015
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,521
Do you need anything?

1016
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,273
Well...

1017
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:24,817
She wanted sausages.

1018
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,950
So our sister-in-law-to-be

1019
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,869
loves sausages.

1020
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,538
We have some left, right?

1021
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,039
Cook them for her.

1022
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,166
All right.

1023
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,960
Oh, and please have the edges cut.

1024
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,045
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1025
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,130
Right.

1026
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,888
This is great.

1027
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,681
You're such a good match.

1028
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,057
You're a good match.

1029
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,852
I'm so happy for you two.

1030
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,730
It's his first time
bringing his girlfriend.

1031
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,023
Really?

1032
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,816
Is that true?

1033
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,403
How many times did you bring yours?

1034
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,487
What?

1035
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,698
That was a joke.

1036
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,787
You're mischievous.

1037
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,583
Grandpa, stop frowning.

1038
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,502
They love each other
and want to get married.

1039
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,923
-We should all congratulate them.
-Right.

1040
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,425
Right. A-jung,

1041
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,135
you should give Grandpa

1042
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,429
grandchildren to relieve his anger.

1043
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:37,848
This is the second step.

1044
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,601
Talking back to your elders.

1045
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,937
I'm sorry to cut in,

1046
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,688
but I don't agree.

1047
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,565
What?

1048
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:49,610
Love doesn't always have to end
with children.

1049
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,365
I think love is about
growth and happiness.

1050
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,660
A-jung, I meant--

1051
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,161
Speaking of which,

1052
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:00,996
we don't plan to have kids.

1053
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:05,626
Declaring to be a DINK at
the first meeting. It'd never look good.

1054
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,380
Well...

1055
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,759
You stay here.

1056
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,845
Let me have a chat with this lady.

1057
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:18,847
Let me talk to you.

1058
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,474
Sure.

1059
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,018
I'm coming with you.

1060
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,144
No,

1061
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,771
just stay here and chat.

1062
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,022
Are you sure?

1063
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:30,442
That's when I'll do the last step.

1064
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:32,486
Good boy, Do-han.

1065
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,737
Intimate touching.

1066
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,572
Oh, my!

1067
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:39,827
What?

1068
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:45,666
What?

1069
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:50,879
What...

1070
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,673
She's crazy.

1071
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,591
She's totally mad.

1072
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,845
A weirdo's joining our family.

1073
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,889
How frivolous. Unbelievable.

1074
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,476
Let go of me.

1075
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,312
What's wrong with her?

1076
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:07,479
Is she crazy?

1077
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:09,356
Is she trying to ruin us?

1078
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,568
She doesn't seem to have a brain.

1079
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:16,280
How else could she act like that
when she wants to marry you?

1080
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,285
Fine. Forget everything else.

1081
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:24,788
What was this?

1082
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,290
What was that?

1083
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:27,541
Stop that. Gross.

1084
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:29,043
Grandpa

1085
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,627
would never accept her.

1086
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,130
I'm still going to marry her.

1087
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,549
What? Aren't you listening?

1088
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,010
Don't you want Grandpa's approval?

1089
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,225
You're the crazy one.

1090
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:47,728
You're crazy.

1091
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,564
Ms. Na.

1092
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:52,566
Yes?

1093
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:58,864
Didn't you say you'd break up with Do-han?

1094
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,657
I did.

1095
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:04,328
Can I ask why you changed your mind?

1096
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:15,005
I didn't want him to suffer because of me.

1097
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,092
He's suffering?

1098
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,638
And it's all because of you?

1099
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,891
No, I doubt I'm the only reason,

1100
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,852
but I didn't want to be

1101
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,979
one of the reasons.

1102
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,943
Whenever I felt I couldn't do something,

1103
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:42,491
Do-han was the only one
who kept telling me I could do it.

1104
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,953
He always supported me.

1105
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:51,959
Whether or not we get married
and become wife and husband,

1106
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,213
Do-han is my best friend.

1107
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,132
So?

1108
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,300
So,

1109
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,553
I came to the conclusion

1110
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,348
that in the opposite situation,
I don't want him

1111
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:08,725
to feel despair.

1112
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,272
I understand if you oppose.

1113
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,900
Whatever decision you make,

1114
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,528
I'll accept it.

1115
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,758
I know what you're thinking.

1116
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,302
But don't say it.

1117
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,512
What am I thinking?

1118
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,890
Your face already says,

1119
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,767
"How do I get rid of her?"

1120
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:52,478
You're right.

1121
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,689
There seems to be only one way

1122
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:57,649
to fix this problem.

1123
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,485
Do-han.

1124
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,820
The reason why you rejected

1125
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:05,491
all those girls
and wanted to give up everything

1126
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:09,870
is her?

1127
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:11,955
Yes.

1128
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,625
Even if you object,

1129
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,752
I'm marrying her.

1130
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:23,592
If you don't even want to see us,
we'll live quietly in New York,

1131
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,594
out of your sight.

1132
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,641
There's no need.

1133
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:37,064
When we drank together, you told me

1134
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:41,318
that little brothers
normally only think about

1135
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,570
stealing from their older brothers.

1136
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,406
There's something I want

1137
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:48,617
to steal from him now.

1138
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,748
I'm going to allow this marriage.

1139
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,464
What?

1140
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,258
I'll accept it.

1141
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,884
What is it?

1142
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:07,261
Na A-jung.

1143
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,345
What?

1144
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,305
It's you.

1145
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,226
I'm going to steal you

1146
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:16,979
from my brother.

1147
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,053
I've made up my mind.

1148
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,179
I'll seduce you

1149
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,681
and dump you.

1150
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:35,766
You'll seduce me?

1151
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,726
But if you're so confident, try me.

1152
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:38,977
I'm curious

1153
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:41,021
whether or not I'll fall for you.

1154
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:42,856
We're going on a date.

1155
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,275
So? Are you getting butterflies?

1156
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:49,780
I really need A-jung.

1157
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,573
Why do you keep

1158
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:53,492
getting hurt in front of me?

1159
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,328
I thought you hated me the most.

1160
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,288
I guess I like you, then.

1161
