1
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,404
Sometimes, we desperately hope
that some secrets

2
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,365
are kept hidden away

3
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,494
so that we'll never find out.

4
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,498
But in the end, we are forced

5
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,083
to face the hard truth.

6
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,255
Why are you telling me this now?

7
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:34,428
Why should I hear this from you
when Do-han didn't tell me himself?

8
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,098
Because I want to hurt him.

9
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,560
I told Do-han I would

10
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,939
focus on my own happiness now.

11
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,526
When that happens, everything falls apart.

12
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,196
There's no use pretending
you're unaffected.

13
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,532
Then you've failed.

14
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,244
I'm not using that

15
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,996
to hurt my brother.

16
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,501
I don't care

17
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,504
who he likes.

18
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,007
He's still my brother.

19
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,303
So if you want to keep that happiness,

20
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,639
you'd better keep your mouth shut.

21
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,018
If Do-han really gets hurt because of you,

22
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,022
I won't let it slide.

23
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:44,164
You're bound to get caught in the end
if you fake it.

24
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,378
I have some things
I want to hide from you.

25
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,882
Do you really have to
dig into them like that?

26
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,301
You really shouldn't lie to me, Do-han.

27
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,386
I would have no one to trust.

28
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,179
That'd really suck.

29
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,472
I have a lot to say.

30
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,267
I just don't know what to say first.

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,227
But I know one thing.

32
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,397
I'm not a good brother to you.

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,941
Do you know why I'm marrying her?

34
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,360
Because I'm sick

35
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,072
of making excuses to everyone.

36
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,701
Do-han.

37
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,870
You selfish bastard.

38
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,135
What? Ji-han.

39
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,219
Come with me.

40
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,647
And the reason why

41
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,317
we keep up that stupid act regardless

42
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,029
is to protect someone.

43
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,158
So that person won't crumble.

44
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,080
We have to run

45
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,291
from certain truths

46
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,421
and certain emotions somehow.

47
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,442
What is it this time?

48
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,778
You're the one who crossed the line.

49
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,156
So I'm giving you a warning.

50
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,367
Don't mess with me.

51
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,830
Or it won't end with this next time.

52
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
Next time?

53
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,209
What do you mean?

54
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,587
Jung Dae-hyeon.

55
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,232
Where did she go?

56
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,360
Well...

57
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,420
You should at least explain
what's going on.

58
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,217
Tell me

59
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,804
why the hell you're doing this right now

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,640
so I can try to understand

61
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,144
or go back and explain this to Do-han.

62
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,812
I won't send you back

63
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,938
to Do-han.

64
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,486
-Ji-han.
-You said you felt uneasy about me.

65
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,948
Then don't marry him.

66
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,659
I can't be your brother-in-law.

67
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,536
No,

68
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,705
I won't.

69
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,586
Why?

70
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,838
You told me

71
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,633
to be happy with Do-han.

72
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,637
You can't be happy with him.

73
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,932
You'll be miserable.

74
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,559
So why are you telling me that now?

75
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,187
Weren't you worried
your decision was wrong...

76
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,482
that night?

77
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,070
So fix it before it's too late.

78
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,072
It's not

79
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,449
too late to fix it.

80
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:09,012
EPISODE 8

81
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,400
A-jung! What happened...

82
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,946
What's he doing here with you?

83
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,991
I called him and asked him

84
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,368
to pick me up here.

85
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,954
You did?

86
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,623
I mean, I didn't feel it at first,

87
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,627
but wearing the dress made me
realize I was really getting married,

88
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,379
and I suddenly got confused.

89
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,382
So I ended up...

90
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,927
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,430
Then you could've told me.

92
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,684
Or at least take your phone.
Do you know how startled I was?

93
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,894
Don't be too harsh.

94
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,687
It's not her fault.

95
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,940
It really is my fault.

96
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,443
Sorry for worrying you.

97
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,449
But I felt better
after talking with Ji-han.

98
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,909
Right?

99
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,333
Let's talk after you change.

100
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,460
You should've at least changed.

101
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,794
It's uncomfortable.

102
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,005
No.

103
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,590
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,968
This won't happen again.

105
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,054
I promise.

106
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,598
Let's go inside.

107
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,755
I can't be your brother-in-law.

108
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,091
No,

109
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,926
I won't.

110
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,347
I won't send you back to Do-han.

111
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,894
You jerk.

112
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,355
I like you enough to get angry

113
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,649
if someone...

114
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,402
insults you.

115
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,612
What can we do now...

116
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:34,658
If you fall for me,
you won't marry Do-han.

117
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,328
If we really like each other?

118
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,201
I'm letting it slide because of A-jung.

119
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,663
I've known her for a long time.

120
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,584
I'm sure
she didn't call you first earlier.

121
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,005
I don't know what happened
between you two,

122
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,549
but I'll just trust A-jung and let it go.

123
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,637
What? Do you have something to say?

124
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,268
I'm tired. Good night.

125
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,606
-Where are you going?
-See you.

126
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,744
What did you mean earlier?

127
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,913
Dae-hyeon, answer me.

128
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,374
What have you done?

129
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,784
What's the point of telling

130
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,745
the truth now?

131
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,594
It'll only hurt her.

132
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,330
Grandpa.

133
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,001
Grandpa.

134
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,003
What brings you here?

135
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:02,008
I heard you began handing over the company
to Do-han, transferring your shares.

136
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,803
And rumors that he's attending
the board meeting.

137
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,929
They're not rumors.

138
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,598
It's time I handed it over.

139
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,226
Grandpa.

140
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,562
Go on.

141
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,235
I really don't understand

142
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,905
why you're supporting them so much.

143
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,659
Mom passed away because of them.

144
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:37,335
Or is there really something
I don't know about the accident?

145
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,797
You know,

146
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,845
you've never explained
Mom's accident to us properly.

147
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,308
It's nothing nice to tell you.

148
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,726
Grandpa.

149
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,477
She's our mom!

150
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,105
Even if she cheated
and had other children,

151
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,149
she's still our mom.

152
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:05,572
Min-woong and I
got our mom stolen twice because of them!

153
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,116
You should be pitying us,

154
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,118
not them!

155
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,833
I do pity you.

156
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,960
But

157
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:23,256
do you really think it's their fault?

158
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,677
What do you mean?

159
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,096
She was my daughter.

160
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,934
Don't waste your energy,
and focus on your own work.

161
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,355
Fine.

162
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,816
I'll get going, then.

163
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,495
Honey. You've been like this for days.

164
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,955
You should eat to have energy.

165
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,750
What's the point?

166
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,794
I don't even deserve to eat.

167
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,672
Everyone deserves to eat.

168
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,800
Even criminals have
three meals a day in prison.

169
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,680
I've realized that ambition's
stronger than blood

170
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,016
and that you get betrayed
if you let your guard down.

171
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,478
How could she do this to me? Damn it.

172
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,605
Get a grip.

173
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,777
Will you give up
just because you lost once?

174
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,076
Crises happen to people

175
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,870
so that they'll overcome them.

176
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,459
Honey, you have to overcome this
and become someone powerful,

177
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,753
like the head of LJ.

178
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,384
-Am I capable of that?
-Of course!

179
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,136
You're Choi Min-woong!

180
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,346
-Go for it!
-All right.

181
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,597
You can do it!

182
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,814
Answer it.

183
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,150
What is it?

184
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,487
What?

185
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,701
What is it?

186
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,785
What?

187
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,704
What is it?

188
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,875
I can't! I can't do it!

189
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,545
Choi Seung-a, you bitch!
We were supposed to work together!

190
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,589
Mr. Kang, it's me.

191
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,175
I'll accept your offer.

192
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,469
About my mom's accident.

193
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,556
I'm getting curious too.

194
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,561
But you should dig into that man

195
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,272
before Do-han gets the company.

196
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,650
-There isn't much time.
-Don't worry.

197
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,404
I got all the info, and I just need
to confirm it with him.

198
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,659
This is getting interesting.

199
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,778
You told me to fix this now.

200
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,406
I've thought about it all night,

201
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,409
and there's something I need to fix.

202
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,703
You and me.

203
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,498
Wait. I think you're mistaken.

204
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,707
Me?

205
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,626
-Not you and Do-han?
-Yes.

206
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,961
You.

207
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,215
You should stop popping up
here and there and meddling

208
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,550
in my life.

209
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,635
It's exhausting.

210
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,020
Let me check something first.
Then I'll decide whether to stop.

211
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,774
How did you meet Do-han?

212
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,035
Who asked the other out first?

213
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,166
Didn't anything trouble you
while dating him?

214
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,002
-Ji-han.
-Then just...

215
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,796
answer this.

216
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,927
Do you really like

217
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,305
Do-han?

218
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,983
Yes, it's almost painful.

219
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,653
They say you go mad with love,

220
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,615
and I feel like I'm going mad.

221
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,992
That's how much I like him.

222
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:05,163
So I want to marry him
before I get any crazier.

223
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,335
Happy now?

224
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,506
You're up early.

225
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,175
Yes.

226
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,218
-Good morning.
-Morning.

227
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,852
What? What's going on?

228
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,063
What did he do this time?

229
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:35,068
He was being nice to you a few days ago.
What's gotten into him?

230
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,152
It's fine.

231
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,404
You know how fickle he is.

232
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,575
Let's just think of him
as a cute younger brother.

233
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,911
-You think he's cute?
-No.

234
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,414
I mean, let's just think of him like that.

235
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,500
Mind control.

236
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,710
But you seem uncomfortable.

237
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,092
Well, since we're on that topic,

238
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,220
I think I should go back home today.

239
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,806
Because of Ji-han?

240
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,599
No, it's not that.

241
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,479
You know I was going to go back
when the reporters left.

242
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,357
I left in such a hurry too,

243
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,027
and I want to spend time
with my family before our marriage.

244
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,613
All right.

245
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,744
Oh, jeez.

246
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,502
Mr. Lee?

247
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,507
What are you doing here?
This is my office.

248
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,175
I was hiding.

249
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,928
-Why?
-It's hard to pretend.

250
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,349
I can't pretend to be okay or play dumb.

251
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,894
Didn't you say you were great at that?

252
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,736
Have you heard anything
about our family or LJ?

253
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,320
No.

254
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,115
Why? Did something happen?

255
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,700
No.

256
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,496
I was just wondering if there are
any other obsessive reporters.

257
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,959
From now on, keep me posted
on any issues you hear about.

258
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,336
All right.

259
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,633
I feel so anxious.

260
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,844
Do-han would...

261
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,182
Would it be easier to give up...

262
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,518
on LJ?

263
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,603
No!

264
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,812
That's nonsense!

265
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,482
Giving up on LJ? Impossible!

266
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,151
Sorry about that.

267
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,156
That's what I mean. It's strange.

268
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,742
Does he mean it? Maybe he just said it.

269
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,496
Plus, nothing happened
after the news about Ms. Na.

270
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,039
I know.

271
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,877
But he seemed agonized when he said

272
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,129
it wouldn't have gone this far

273
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,173
if he hadn't been greedy.

274
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,842
That everyone was suffering
because of him.

275
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,848
Maybe it's about something else.

276
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,892
God, this is a mess.

277
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,187
You said you'd clean a bit
and use it as Ji-oh's room,

278
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,022
but you took out all her stuff.

279
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,733
I didn't know A-jung would come back.

280
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,944
Why's she suddenly coming back home?

281
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,988
What if she fought with Do-han?

282
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,241
Didn't you hear her?

283
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:32,245
She's spending time with us
before the wedding.

284
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,123
And no matter how feisty A-jung is,

285
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,751
our gentle son-in-law
won't even fight back.

286
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,045
He's right, Mother.

287
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,588
Don't worry.

288
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,590
And even if they did fight,

289
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,759
A-jung would've won.

290
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,554
She'd have fought like a general.

291
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,806
She'll even bring back loot.

292
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,724
Cut it out.

293
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,563
There's lots of dust.

294
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,029
I'm home.

295
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,953
No, I'm sure
something's going on with her.

296
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,747
Come on, stop worrying.

297
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:20,168
Did you forget how I drank with Do-han
and made sure

298
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,087
he'd be good to A-jung?

299
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,131
Don't be ridiculous.

300
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,340
You got wasted,

301
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,467
and he had to carry you home.

302
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,928
You're too weak to scare him.

303
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:34,432
I may be, but A-jung's strong.

304
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,059
Let's just trust A-jung.

305
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,854
Whatever she does, let's trust her

306
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,231
like we always did.

307
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,025
Of course.

308
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,152
My gosh.

309
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,946
When did she grow so much?

310
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,701
She's already getting married now.

311
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,785
Look at her.

312
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,123
Wow. When was this?

313
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,626
Auntie!

314
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,045
Ji-oh.

315
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,964
-"Auntie"?
-What?

316
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,675
A-jung.

317
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,178
I'm home.

318
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,013
A-jung.

319
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,397
Why did you suddenly come back?

320
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,275
Did something happen? Is that it?

321
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,526
No.

322
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,155
It's nothing. Don't worry.

323
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,448
Jeez.

324
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,992
You really think I'll buy that?

325
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,412
Does it show?

326
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,501
I'm sure you can't tell Mom and Dad,

327
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,296
so just tell me. Why did you come back?

328
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,344
My acting's bad these days.

329
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,347
I used to be so good at acting,

330
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:59,433
but now, everything seems so fake.

331
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,812
What happened?
Did your fake husband say something?

332
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,732
He's the one
who wanted you to act for him!

333
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,068
No, it's not that. I just...

334
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,530
I just can't focus on my role.

335
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,286
I felt guilty lying
to Mom and Dad just now,

336
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,914
and I keep feeling other emotions

337
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,042
and getting greedy.

338
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,003
Greedy?

339
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,421
Yes.

340
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,718
Honestly, I want to give up the acting

341
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,594
and just quit,

342
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,596
regardless of my friendship.

343
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,142
But I can't because of that greed.

344
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,396
But wanting to quit

345
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,939
because of greed

346
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,484
is really wrong.

347
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,573
I'd be really shameless, right?

348
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,494
Whatever it is, greed is always
a shameless thing.

349
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,080
What if you're a bit shameless?

350
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,750
If you become happy, then that's good.

351
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,462
Tae-min and I got married
because of greed.

352
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,006
But we're so happy right now.

353
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,549
You could've

354
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,343
been greedier.

355
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,802
Hey! You...

356
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,181
Jeez. Never mind.

357
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,643
It's okay to be greedy.

358
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,104
Come on.

359
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,528
JI-HAN, ARE YOU BUSY?

360
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,447
He's totally ignoring me.

361
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,287
Even if I'm on his hook,
he should at least reply.

362
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,632
How's the business going?

363
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,593
Well enough to buy you dinner.

364
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,431
How's your business going, Chairman Yoon?

365
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,766
You brat.

366
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,768
You really are arrogant.

367
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,563
At least I'm not worried.

368
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,818
You're my daughter, but I envy you.
You have everything.

369
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:17,196
Not everything.
There are things I don't have.

370
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,281
Like what?

371
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,200
There's something I want,

372
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,871
but it's pretty difficult to get it.

373
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,457
If there's something you want,

374
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,544
don't hesitate to use
everything you can to get it.

375
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,504
And throw away your pride.

376
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,714
Get as pathetic and lame as you can.

377
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,677
Do you even know what I want?

378
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,471
I'm your daughter.

379
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:46,142
Don't you want me to stay proud and cool?

380
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,394
Don't you know

381
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,813
that's what's really cool?

382
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,983
If you gain it in the end,
you're the winner.

383
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,744
Do you really like Do-han?

384
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,957
Yes, it's almost painful.

385
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,085
Can't she just like him a little bit?

386
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,259
I couldn't stop their marriage.

387
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,761
How do I stop her now?

388
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,764
I can't tell her Do-han's secret.

389
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,569
Uncle!

390
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,404
Ji-oh.

391
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,072
Hey, Ji-oh.

392
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,951
We're not supposed to talk to strangers.

393
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,832
He's not a bad guy. He's my aunt's friend.

394
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,054
I'm glad I ran into you.
Is your aunt home right now?

395
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,265
No, she went to work.

396
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,351
You shouldn't lie.

397
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,102
She doesn't work.

398
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,313
She does work.

399
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,731
She's an actress.

400
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,902
She said she was filling a hole today.

401
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,279
Really? Is that her role?

402
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,615
A repairman role?

403
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,702
By the way, what are you doing here?

404
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,412
Just visiting.

405
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,581
How old are you?

406
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,458
Seven.

407
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,252
Seven?

408
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,296
You've only known her for seven years,

409
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,841
so you must not know her
as well as my brother.

410
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,644
Have a snack with your friends.

411
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,105
But I didn't sell you any toys.

412
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,481
You sold me info.

413
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,151
Whether your aunt's home
and what she's doing.

414
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,865
You can sell stuff like that?

415
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,202
Then let me sell you more.

416
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,745
Really?

417
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,164
Good idea.

418
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,379
-When are we shooting?
-I don't know.

419
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,006
It's so hot.

420
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,306
Why were you suddenly

421
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,516
looking for a job today?

422
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,853
She was really lucky,

423
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,564
getting an important role
as a replacement.

424
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,611
Weren't you going to focus
on your wedding?

425
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,074
Is something going wrong
regarding your marriage?

426
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,201
It's not that.

427
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,955
I just needed to be my old self
for a moment.

428
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,083
And having no work just made me

429
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,169
have useless thoughts.

430
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,174
I guess she's anxious before the wedding.

431
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,675
I understand.

432
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,802
-So much happened.
-Right.

433
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,472
The family meeting, the reporters,

434
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,058
and living in someone else's house.

435
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,018
You must've been exhausted.

436
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,394
This was a good idea.

437
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,563
Doing something you're used to.

438
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,607
-It's refreshing too.
-Right.

439
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,026
You're right.

440
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,779
I feel much better.

441
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,281
I'm so happy.

442
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:48,092
But didn't you give up opposing
your brother's marriage?

443
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,303
No, I can't just sit
and watch them get married.

444
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,264
Failure is the mother of success.

445
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:58,560
If I analyze the reason I failed,
I'll figure out a way.

446
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:06,527
Be careful. You have to stay alert
and move quickly on a film set.

447
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,907
-Floor director.
-Yes?

448
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,993
There are people taking photos
at the entrance.

449
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,495
-You should stop them.
-Okay.

450
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,789
-Thank you.
-No problem.

451
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,418
Is he for real?

452
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:27,381
He came here so often,
he's like one of their staff now.

453
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,675
Everyone will think he's a staff.

454
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,302
It's the last one.

455
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,054
-Hang in there.
-Okay.

456
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,014
-Thank you.
-What?

457
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:39,852
Ji-han.

458
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,438
What are you doing here?

459
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,814
What is this?

460
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,942
What kind of role is it this time?

461
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,282
An independence fighter.

462
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,286
I'm fighting for freedom.

463
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:01,665
I thought I was freed from your house.
What are you doing here?

464
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,251
You took out your gun,
so I guess you know.

465
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,173
I thought we agreed

466
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,842
you'd stop meddling in my life.

467
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,343
You know about my whims.

468
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,053
Is that a surprise?

469
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,016
Shouldn't you have expected me to come?

470
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,226
Then you'll know how I'll react.

471
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,061
Excuse me!

472
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,605
He's my stalker.

473
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,440
Thanks for the food.

474
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,608
Thank you.

475
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,984
Thank you.

476
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,448
See? Failure is the mother of success.

477
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,160
Too bad.

478
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,954
This is why I came in legally.

479
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,753
What is this? Why's your face here?

480
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,089
NA A-JUNG
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

481
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,302
You gave me money and a job,

482
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:59,223
sent me on a blind date, and now,
you're giving out lunch boxes to stop me?

483
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,933
By the way, your face looks

484
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,851
so different.

485
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,061
Your acting...

486
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,147
is really amazing.

487
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,531
Where are you going?

488
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,826
You should at least make a reaction.

489
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,620
You're making me feel embarrassed. A-jung!

490
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:28,001
I barely made up my mind.
Why are you making me waver again?

491
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,425
I didn't expect to see
Mr. Cold Iced Americano here.

492
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,635
I was so surprised.

493
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,470
It's ridiculous.

494
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,681
Right, I get it now.

495
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:46,228
I was just a good barista to him,
and he had a crush on someone else.

496
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,857
He's putting in so much effort.

497
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,650
She's totally upset.

498
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:54,945
What is it?

499
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,784
I think there's a misunderstanding.

500
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,706
I have nothing to do
with those lunch boxes.

501
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,209
So? What does that have to do with me?

502
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,669
Move!

503
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:13,922
Gosh.

504
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,466
You have uselessly long limbs.

505
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,802
It's not even at my eye level.

506
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,305
Why would they be useless?

507
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,431
I'm flexible.

508
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,944
Hey.

509
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,656
Yes?

510
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,367
I'm just curious.

511
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,122
What's the discount on LJ cosmetics
for LJ employees?

512
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,917
It's 30 percent...

513
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,835
What about hotel stays?

514
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,962
It's 20...

515
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,548
But why are you asking?

516
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,968
Give me your phone.

517
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:04,932
It's face recognition.

518
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,689
I'll contact you if I need cosmetics
or a hotel discount.

519
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,150
-What?
-So you can

520
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,488
contact me if you want to ask anything
about Ji-ae. Deal?

521
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,907
Oh, deal!

522
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:23,742
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

523
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,578
Deal!

524
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,038
Deal!

525
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,290
She's so nice.

526
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,387
It'd be nice to have some beer after.

527
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,429
Together?

528
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,848
What's so funny?

529
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,103
-See you later.
-Okay.

530
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,528
You were laughing just now.
Are you ignoring me?

531
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,948
Did you notice?

532
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,075
You're right.

533
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,827
Wait.

534
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,164
You pointed a gun at me,
and now you ignore me.

535
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,209
And why were you chatting with an officer?

536
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,335
Are you a spy?

537
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,755
It doesn't make sense
to chat with you either.

538
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:21,883
Go.

539
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,595
That guy's weird too.

540
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,765
He's supposed to kill you.

541
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,393
He has no professionalism.

542
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,479
Focus on your roles, everyone!

543
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,317
-You're so annoying.
-Annoying?

544
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,155
Stop avoiding me.

545
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,656
Let me talk to you.

546
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,324
I have to start shooting.

547
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,993
If you want to talk,

548
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,661
go over there

549
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,914
and send some sort of signal.

550
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,167
Or use telepathy.

551
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,710
But I won't answer you.

552
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,296
So leave.

553
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,715
Get ready to rehearse!

554
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,341
-Okay.
-Okay.

555
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,310
He's so aggressive.

556
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,812
He was just laughing with her.

557
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,023
-How cold.
-This way!

558
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,317
Yes. Nice.

559
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,284
She's flying around.

560
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,230
Wow, she's so cool.

561
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,940
-Cut.
-Okay!

562
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,441
-Awesome.
-Great job.

563
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,863
-Good work.
-Great work.

564
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,699
-Great job.
-Good job.

565
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,908
Isn't she cool?

566
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,202
-Great work.
-Let's wrap up.

567
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,788
Bravo!

568
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,291
-Great work.
-Great job.

569
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,750
-Great work.
-Great job.

570
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,127
Hurry up, you guys.

571
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,545
-Okay.
-Great job.

572
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,382
Good job today.

573
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,473
Stop smiling, will you?
Your cheeks will hurt.

574
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,602
Where were you?
Did you see it? It was awesome.

575
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,732
Why don't you just accept Ms. Na now?

576
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,484
You don't seem to have any hope anyway.

577
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,028
I can't let it happen,

578
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,112
no matter what.

579
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,742
Why are you opposing her so much?

580
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,495
It's obvious
that you don't hate her at all.

581
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,080
So what's the reason?

582
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,714
I pity her for trying to become

583
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:51,009
my brother's wife.

584
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,553
I just feel sorry, that's all.

585
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,641
Mr. Lee!

586
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,603
What? Are you ditching me?

587
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,207
Sit.

588
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,542
I won't talk about the marriage.

589
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:39,766
Your acting was cool.

590
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:44,938
I don't believe you.

591
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,191
Don't, then.

592
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:53,947
I mean it.

593
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,158
You were really cool.

594
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,497
You won't be able to do this
if you marry him.

595
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,127
Fine.

596
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,716
It's not just this.

597
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,511
Just living is acting too.

598
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:18,930
Right.

599
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,725
We're all acting.

600
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,645
I'm acting a lot too.

601
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,483
Is it going well?

602
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,445
No,

603
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:35,989
it's not.

604
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,036
I found out something I shouldn't know.

605
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,709
I'm in a similar situation.

606
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,003
I feel the same way.

607
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,631
I'm trying to pretend I'm fine,

608
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:56,926
but it's hard.

609
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,806
You know, false acting is bound

610
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,226
to fall apart in the end.

611
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,192
But what can we do?

612
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,778
We have to keep going.

613
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,157
But

614
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,159
if it's too hard,

615
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,203
how about a break?

616
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,791
It's break time.

617
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,585
Why not?

618
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,173
It's break time,

619
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,802
so it'll be okay, right?

620
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,015
Just for a while.

621
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,372
The person you are calling...

622
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,921
What are you up to, Dae-hyeon?

623
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:24,389
Yes, Mr. Kim.

624
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,434
The chairman wants to see you urgently.

625
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,269
Right now?

626
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,440
What did you want to talk about?

627
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,568
Yes.

628
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,238
You should start managing the company.

629
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,158
I believe you should

630
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:46,244
start by joining the board meeting

631
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,706
that's to take place soon.

632
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,999
I shouldn't.

633
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,710
-Why?
-There are still rumors

634
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,378
going around

635
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,215
about A-jung and my birth.

636
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,260
I told you before.

637
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,637
Running from it won't solve anything.

638
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,431
If you keep running,

639
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,100
you can't protect yourself or your people.

640
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,977
-Grandpa.
-Rumors?

641
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,855
If that's the problem,
now's the best time.

642
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,734
More rumors could pop up later,
and it'll be harder

643
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,070
to deal with them then.

644
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,615
And it'll get harder to find your place.

645
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,576
Something that'll hold me down now

646
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,579
will hold me down in that position too.

647
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,875
No, it won't be able to.

648
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:34,959
Why?

649
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:40,089
Because that position's
too high up to reach.

650
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:41,841
Do-han.

651
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:46,012
Do you know why you're so afraid
and there are so many scandals?

652
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,057
It's because you don't have power.

653
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,102
If you want to protect people around you,

654
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,940
you have to protect yourself first.

655
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,024
Yourself!

656
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,452
We're here.

657
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,916
I knew it.
You were pretending to be asleep.

658
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,376
I slept so well.

659
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,835
You were chatty during break time.

660
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:22,340
But it's over now. And you were going
to say the same thing anyway.

661
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,760
You knew that,
but you asked me to take you to Do-han?

662
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,637
And did it have to be today?

663
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,721
Aren't you tired?

664
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,014
Do-han's the one

665
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,183
who asked to see me.

666
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,769
And you're the one who came today.

667
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,981
Blame it on Do-han and yourself, not me.

668
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,284
A-jung.

669
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,369
Ji-han.

670
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,579
Chae-won.

671
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,125
What brings you here?

672
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,003
I came to see you. You weren't picking up.

673
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:06,217
I guess you weren't busy with work,
seeing as you're with her.

674
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,011
Oh, I...

675
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,680
We just ran into each other near here.

676
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,890
Is that so?

677
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,392
Yes.

678
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,270
I'm meeting Do-han, so I'll get going.

679
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,775
We should hang out together next time.

680
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,278
The four of us could be a family.

681
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,696
A family...

682
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:27,989
A family?

683
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,491
We're not a family yet.

684
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:31,868
Not yet.

685
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,997
I'm actually chasing after Ji-han.

686
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,501
What? It's true.

687
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,548
I used to pretend to be cool,
but I can't anymore.

688
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:48,635
I like him so much
that I get really jealous now.

689
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,139
I'm even bothered
by you two being together.

690
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:56,809
It's funny, right?

691
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,728
You're his sister-in-law

692
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,605
of all people.

693
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,525
I should really make him mine soon.

694
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,278
I'll do my best from now on.

695
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:10,615
I'll be honest about my feelings
so I won't regret it.

696
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:26,047
What?

697
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,425
Don't force a smile.
You said you'd be honest.

698
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,598
Still, just let me smile.
I look prettier smiling.

699
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,310
I meant what I said

700
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,604
about you and Ms. Na.

701
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,359
It's weird. You seem to be
more than just in-laws.

702
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,819
I've always felt it.

703
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:50,238
I didn't tell you

704
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,574
since I thought
it'd make me seem so pathetic,

705
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,160
but I can't ignore it now.

706
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,081
Tell me honestly.

707
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,875
Is something going on between you two?

708
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,256
No, nothing.

709
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,217
You're drunk.

710
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:12,885
Let's go.

711
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,140
You're making me even more pathetic.

712
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,936
If you can't hide it perfectly,
why don't you be honest?

713
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:25,064
It felt awful when I did it,

714
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,025
but it's better than being a coward.

715
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:32,905
I'll get going.

716
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:04,979
I'll do my best from now on.

717
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,232
I'll be honest about my feelings
so I won't regret it.

718
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,401
I envy her.

719
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,653
What?

720
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:14,363
What?

721
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,365
Well...

722
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,243
I meant Ms. Yoon.

723
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,078
She seemed cool.

724
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,414
Oh, right. You said you met her earlier.

725
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:28,628
What's so cool about her
that makes the great A-jung envy her?

726
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,755
What I envy the most about her...

727
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:35,551
is how she's honest.

728
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,304
And I envy her for having

729
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,641
the right to be.

730
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,062
Is something wrong?

731
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,273
-You first.
-Me?

732
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,108
Is something wrong?

733
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:54,946
Well, yes.

734
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:03,204
You know, the guy I used to date.
The one you met last time.

735
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,123
He called me recently.

736
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,169
-What did he say?
-It seemed

737
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:14,924
like he told someone my secret,

738
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:16,676
but I'm not sure.

739
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,554
Then Grandpa suddenly wanted to see me.

740
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:20,721
Does he know?

741
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,475
He just told me to take over the company.

742
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,813
He said I could protect myself
if I took over

743
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,648
and gained power.

744
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,151
Well, people won't attack me,

745
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,696
and I won't get caught.

746
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:40,992
But would that be really protecting me?

747
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,203
It'd be locking myself up.

748
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:48,291
I don't know.
That's what I thought until now,

749
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,543
but maybe it's no big deal.

750
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,754
To be honest, I got scared

751
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,715
after he called.

752
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,553
That other people would suffer
because of me.

753
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:04,015
But still,

754
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,183
I'm glad I have you.

755
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,145
You're always on my side.

756
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,527
But what about you? What's going on?

757
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:20,656
It's nothing.

758
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,700
Nothing's going on.

759
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:24,869
What?

760
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:58,194
Right.

761
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,074
I'll just be honest.

762
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:11,874
You're home.

763
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,418
Yes.

764
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,754
Where's A-jung?

765
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:18,756
She left.

766
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,179
Really?

767
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,474
I have something to tell you.

768
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,019
-About A-jung?
-What?

769
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,938
Let's stop talking about that.

770
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,857
I know you still don't like her.
I guessed it

771
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,609
at the dress shop.

772
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:43,030
But I have no intention
of breaking it off.

773
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,283
I like her,

774
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:49,537
and I'm going to marry her.

775
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,417
-How much do you like her?
-What?

776
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,127
She likes you so much it's painful.

777
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,046
What about you?

778
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,928
Do you really like her?

779
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:12,435
I guess we really are brothers,

780
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,187
seeing how we're both cowards.

781
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,315
-Ji-han.
-Do-han.

782
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,569
Let's stop being cowards.

783
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:25,698
Let her go.

784
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:28,868
Don't marry her.

785
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,745
That's enough!

786
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,498
I'm already going through a lot right now.

787
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,835
If there's a reason,
just explain it to me.

788
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,547
I can't stand your whims anymore.

789
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,841
Seriously?

790
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,679
Selfish bastard.

791
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,014
What?

792
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,312
You're full of self-pity,

793
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,441
aren't you?

794
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,277
It's so ugly.

795
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,030
Aren't you ashamed

796
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:08,866
of living like that?

797
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,743
You bastard.

798
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,301
You're the one doing whatever you want.

799
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,136
What?

800
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,806
Every time.

801
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,100
Regarding your marriage,

802
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,645
when you left five years ago,
and when Mom passed away...

803
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,817
Did you ever tell me properly?

804
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:48,364
About what you'd do with your life
or how you wanted to live.

805
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,825
-I--
-But!

806
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,412
I always kept quiet.

807
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:59,708
I felt sorry, thinking that maybe

808
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,379
I didn't give you enough trust.

809
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,758
Since we're surrounded by enemies.

810
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,510
Grandpa?

811
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:13,597
Min-woong, Seung-a,
everyone whispering behind our backs.

812
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,057
And I was the reason!

813
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,606
Because I caused our parents' deaths.

814
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:26,694
Fine.

815
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,197
I understand you not trusting me.

816
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,159
You can keep secrets

817
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,244
and lie to me.

818
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,080
But what about others?

819
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,209
What about A-jung?

820
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,132
Please.

821
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,552
Stop thinking about yourself

822
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,055
and think about others getting hurt.

823
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:15,868
He found out.

824
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,061
I must be crazy.

825
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,358
Having feelings for Ji-han?

826
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:59,536
LEE JI-HAN

827
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:30,818
What is it?

828
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,112
Can you come out?

829
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,032
I'm near your house.

830
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,577
This is really the last time.

831
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,638
What?

832
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,224
What happened to your face?

833
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,103
I always look handsome, you know.

834
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:08,981
What happened?

835
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,192
Who did this?

836
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:14,278
If I tell you,

837
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,905
will you hit them for me?

838
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,952
Just break off your marriage instead.

839
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,748
Did you fight with Do-han?

840
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:34,882
Why?

841
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,427
I told him to break it off.

842
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,305
You deserved it, then.

843
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:45,559
He should've hit your mouth,
not your cheek.

844
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:52,775
By the way,

845
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,320
why are you doing this?

846
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,451
Why are you so persistent?

847
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:07,122
Because I like you, A-jung.

848
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,042
So much that it's painful.

849
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,382
So I can't keep acting.

850
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,426
I'm giving up.

851
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,681
So I can't do it anymore.

852
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:28,102
I said I'd seduce you,

853
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,021
but I guess I'm the one

854
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,109
who likes you now.

855
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,738
That's why I'm opposing.

856
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:46,328
-Stop joking.
-I'm not.

857
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,123
I'm not lying or making an excuse.

858
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,419
The real reason...

859
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,049
is just that.

860
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:14,648
You're crazy.

861
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,656
You lunatic.

862
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:28,639
Hey!

863
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:31,975
I'm so dumbfounded.

864
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,769
Have you lost it?

865
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:35,896
Are you insane?

866
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:38,065
How could you?

867
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:39,858
This is crazy!

868
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:44,154
I'm going to be your sister-in-law.
How could you do this?

869
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,823
Even if you did like me,

870
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,367
you should've

871
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,577
kept it to yourself!

872
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:55,165
You said you cared about your brother.
Was it all a lie?

873
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,835
How could you do that to your brother?

874
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,213
Answer me.

875
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:03,715
Answer me.

876
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,551
Answer me!

877
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,096
Or do I seem easy to you?

878
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,558
Do I seem easy?

879
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,894
That's why you're

880
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,273
doing this to me, isn't it?

881
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,235
Say something!

882
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,532
Answer me!

883
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:42,796
It's not that.

884
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,426
I'm sorry.

885
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,804
Who are you to keep doing this to me?

886
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,391
You're making me feel so confused!

887
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:57,686
I was barely

888
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,439
holding myself back until now.

889
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,895
I've gone crazy because of you.

890
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,752
Just trust me now.

891
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,004
When did you start liking me?

892
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:52,259
What if you met me before Do-han?

893
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:56,471
Do you really think it would
work out between you two?

894
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,932
Would she be okay with it?

895
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,228
Tell me everything honestly from now on.

896
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,230
What is this?

897
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,440
It's your brother.

898
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,941
We need to talk.

899
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,609
No way...

900
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,278
Let's be honest.

901
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:15,157
When did things start to go wrong?

902
