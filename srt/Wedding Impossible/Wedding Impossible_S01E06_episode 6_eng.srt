1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,730
   
   

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,960
   
   

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,410
   

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,390
   

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,840
     

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,240
   

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,990
   

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,360
   

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,900
   

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,600
   

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,990
May God help you trust in His mercy

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,590
and confess the sins you committed truthfully.

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,060
Father,

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,760
I think I must be possessed by Satan.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,960
What?

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,080
Otherwise, the things that are happening to me can't be explained.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,370
I get nauseous tens of times in a day, and my head's about to split open because of this.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,120
I've never known what insomnia is,

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,310
but I can't even sleep properly these days.

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,130
Please tell me what's causing you such agony, Brother.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,200
My heart's beating...

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,670
at a place where it shouldn't be.

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,890
 Regardless of my will, 

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,420
 I keep looking where I shouldn't. 

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,280
 Though I know I shouldn't be going there, 

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,580
 my feet keep leading me there without me knowing. 

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:53,980


28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,350
 I have no idea, either... 

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,610
 why I keep caring about that person. 

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,960
 Why did I have to harbor such dark feelings? 

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,620
 I thought you didn't like rain. 

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,440
 Lee Ji Han. 

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,580
I'm sure something's wrong with me.

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,880
If that's not the case, why would I step into that sinful path on my own accord?

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,980
Father, do you think we could

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,300
perform that right now?

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,590
Huh? Perform what?

38
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,840
- Exorcism. 
 - Exorcism—

39
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,200
Whatever feeling it may be, harboring it isn't a sin.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,750
No, I don't want to harbor it even if it's not a sin.

41
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,820
Brother, turning a blind eye and avoiding like now

42
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,700
will only bring bigger chaos within yourself.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,280
What are you telling me to do, then?

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,540
Examine those feelings properly instead.

45
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,740
And you just have to choose the path that's most correct.

46
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,140
Don't worry too much.

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,710
I'll now pray for you. Let's pray together.

48
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,450
Dear God, who's full of love,

49
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:22,350
your lost lamb looks onto you desperately today for your wisdom.

50
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,120
Even in times of trials and hardship...

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,370
I pray that woman be gone within me.

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,420
I implore you to take her out for sure.

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,240
Please.

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,350
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

55
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,760
 Lee Ji Han. 

56
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,980
 Lee Ji Han! 

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,010
 What's wrong? 

58
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,080
 Let's share. 

59
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,700
Gosh, what a little rascal.

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,710
He'd rather die than listen to me.

61
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,230
He got soaked in the rain.

62
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,060
I wonder if he's feeling okay.

63
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,860
   

64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,300
Wait a minute.

65
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,380
So what if he caught a cold? What does it have to do with me?

66
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,970
It's not like I told him to stand in the rain.

67
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,300
He's the one who threw the umbrella.

68
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,950
- Honey. 
 - Yes?

69
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,750
How long does it take to go to Jeonju from here?

70
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,200
Jeonju?

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,220
It takes about three to four hours. Why?

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,110
Oh, I'm just wondering if I should've just gone and eaten there.

73
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,620
Had I known the bibimbap delivery would take forever like this.

74
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,590
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,470
Huh?

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,790
My, oh, my. W-Who is she talking to right now?

77
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,850
She's really a great actor.

78
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,670
It's hard to be doing that in your own yard, right?

79
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,280
You're right.

80
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,080
Wow! It's still fortunate she didn't go for anything else but acting, right?

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,670
Right!

82
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,440
A Jeong found the right path for her.

83
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,590
The problem is my bibimbap went rogue.

84
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,610
Honey, let's just be patient for a bit longer.

85
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,160
We won't be seeing that for much longer now. Right?

86
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,710
Gosh, that crazy brat. Geez...

87
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,830
Yes, it's still not too late.

88
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,490
I just need to go on the right path.

89
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,910
   

90
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Are you putting me to the test right now?

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,010
Even if you show me the wrong path, it won't work.

92
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,660
Because I've made up my mind.

93
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,080
W-Where are you going?

94
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,160
That's not the way. It's this way.

95
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,630
I know it, too.

96
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,830
I can tell you didn't know.

97
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,610
107!

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,830
108!

99
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,020
My knees will give before I get Na A Jeong out.

100
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,480
With this much work, either Buddha or God will get that woman out of me.

101
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,380
What's this?

102
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,510
W-What's this?

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,880
What's the use chanting the mantra?

104
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,340
A video played by mistake undoes it all.

105
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,370
"How to forget someone you like."

106
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,920
   
 It's simple. Just confess your feelings. 

107
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,070
 You naturally forget when you get rejected with humiliation. 

108
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,780
It's easy to say since it's not happening to you.

109
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,030
I'm going through all this so I won't have to be humiliated.

110
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,120
 Make 1,000 paper cranes and make a wish. 

111
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,540
 Wish you can forget that person. 

112
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,820
 Though it's a classic, it works. 

113
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,720
Are you kidding me? Who has the time to make 1,000?

114
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,670
People with short lifespans will die before they can make a wish.

115
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,480
 Take a walk at Deoksu Palace's Stone-Wall Road, the mecca of breakups. 

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,110
 Loving on your own is also love and 

117
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,680
 breaking up alone is also a breakup. 

118
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,990
They're all superstitions.

119
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,020
What are you doing?

120
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,850
Are you sleeping?

121
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,340
Get out if you've got nothing to say.

122
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,200
I've got many things to say.

123
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,350
I just don't know what to say first.

124
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,230
I want to ask if you're sick,

125
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,840
but I don't know if I should ask about getting soaked in rain first

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,940
or what upset you so much that you got soaked in the rain which you hate.

127
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,880
I want to apologize,

128
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,560
but I don't know if I should first apologize for not defending you in front of that reporter...

129
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,060
or saying I won't be your brother anymore.

130
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,120
But I can tell one thing for sure.

131
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,280
That I'm not a good brother to you.

132
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,230
Just give it some more time.

133
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,400
Grandfather still finds it a little hard to do,

134
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,780
but he'll soon acknowledge you.

135
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,610
And when time passes, you'll also acknowledge A Jeong.

136
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,970
I sent your wet clothes for dry cleaning.

137
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,530
I left tea on the table, so drink it before it gets cold.

138
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm going out.

139
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,970
You've gone mad, Lee Ji Han.

140
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,790
How are you going to face Brother now?

141
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,980
   

142
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,580
Are you feelings better?

143
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,530
Gosh, I didn't think I'd ever live long enough to see you worry about me.

144
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,530
I'm thankful, but you don't need to worry.

145
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,580
That's what I was going to do, too.

146
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,510
But actually seeing you makes me worry.

147
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,070
- Is that all? 
 - I felt it one more time.

148
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,320
That I can never take your seat, Grandfather.

149
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,530
I think your seat is full of things I can't shoulder or understand.

150
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,020
Really? Try sitting down in it first.

151
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,070
After you sit in that seat, you'll gradually realize it.

152
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,610
I don't know why that reporter is still hanging around our family.

153
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,260
I don't know why you keep getting involved.

154
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,410
From what I saw that day, he'll be worse going forward, if anything.

155
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,780
I don't want to get sucked into this.

156
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,650
You mean you're scared, not that you don't want to get sucked in.

157
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,240
Scared you might become that reporter's target.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Are you scared?

159
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,380
If you're scared, don't run away and grow your power in that seat.

160
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,840
That's how you can protect you and your people.

161
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,530
I'll get going now.

162
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,000
We need to bring your wedding forward.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,590
- Pardon? 
 - I already told Secretary Kim.

164
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,660
So, schedule the family introduction with A Jeong's parents.

165
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,980
Hold on.

166
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,710
Why do you suddenly want to move it up?

167
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,990
It already started.

168
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,650
I think that the reporter already started looking into you and A Jeong.

169
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,920
Why?

170
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,930
Isn't that what worried you enough to ask Secretary Kim to prepare

171
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,450
A Jeong's press release?

172
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,070
   

173
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,190
What's the use of working without a break?

174
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,290
I'm back to doing this crap because no one wants to hire me.

175
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,990
I don't even know if I can include stuff like Court Lady One and Colleague Three here.

176
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,770
How would they know if I'm the first, second, or third? Agree?

177
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,510
My mom told me to quit acting after this year.

178
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,370
She said if I'm going to be doing this next year,

179
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,080
she said she'd open up a workshop for me, so I could continue pottery.

180
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,350
Right! You were the goddess of pottery major, Jong Hee, huh?

181
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,510
That's why I withdrew my savings and shot a new profile.

182
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,070
Because I won't need my money if Mom will get me the workshop.

183
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,680
Gosh, how nice! Immature and reckless.

184
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,340
Even those things will become boring after time passes like us,

185
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,750
so enjoy while you can.

186
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,960
Yes, enjoy while you can.

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,030
How are you two boring, Unni?

188
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,950
One's preparing for her wedding and

189
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,660
the other one's flirting.

190
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,770
Are you flirting with someone, Unni?

191
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,590
She's talking nonsense! How could I have such a thing?

192
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,530
   

193
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,690
Hey, Do Han.

194
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,460
Oh, right now?

195
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,400
Okay, I'll come to your studio.

196
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,440
Okay.

197
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,540
You left me behind so I was wondering how well you were doing.

198
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,520
The tone of your voice tells me you're having a terrible time, huh?

199
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,660
What do you mean? When did I ever leave you behind?

200
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,970
I made space for you to leave with Brother.

201
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,920
I think I told you I'm on your side.

202
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,710
That means I want to be by your side.

203
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,660
At least when you're having a hard time.

204
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,130
I was already regretting it.

205
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,910
I should've left with you back then, CEO Yoon.

206
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,630
But why are you working out now?

207
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,480
You know what they say.

208
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,880
A healthy mind resides in a healthy body.

209
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,800
I was too busy with stuff that I haven't been taking care of myself lately.

210
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,310
So suddenly? Why? Are you ill?

211
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,330
I was about to be.

212
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,140
But I found it early on, so I think it'll get better.

213
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,400
 Wait, you're serious? What is it? 

214
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,650
 It's not a serious illness, is it? 

215
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,440
It's just a kind of an inflammation caused by a small infection.

216
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,290
Don't worry. I'll get better soon.

217
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,580
Because I'm going to do my best to fully recover.

218
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,270
Excuse me, you have a guest.

219
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,090
Hi!

220
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,680
What's with the face? I'm so sad.

221
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,490
We could've become family at one time.

222
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,540
But we didn't become family.

223
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,860
Doesn't that mean we're not close enough to meet without a notice like this?

224
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,460
Does that mean you're close enough to go to my mom's memorial service with my grandfather?

225
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,120
You've got interesting rumors these days.

226
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,660
I heard you're supporting Myeongju shopping mall because you like my brother.

227
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,100
But I've got more than one brother.

228
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,940
Which one of the two is it?

229
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,600
I need to know to get rid of the right one.

230
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,980
Unni,

231
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,060
I've always thought you were a smart and meticulous person.

232
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,860
Thanks for the compliment, but neither of us has time to change the subject, do we?

233
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,060
But I don't think that was the case, either.

234
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,530
Because I found out everything, Unni.

235
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,150
That you're the one who sent that reporter to the memorial park.

236
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,790
I must've been mistaken in many aspects.

237
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,120
Had I known we didn't need to mind manners with each other,

238
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,340
I would've gone to you in the first place

239
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,990
that I know everything.

240
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,070
Even though I know everything, I'm telling you instead of going to the chairman

241
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,680
because this is the last warning I can give you.

242
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,910
A warning to stop messing with your brother.

243
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,660
So which one is it?

244
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,570
Are you telling me not to mess with Lee Do Han or Lee Ji Han?

245
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,420
Don't mess with either one of them.

246
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,690
It gives Ji Han a hard time, whichever one you mess with.

247
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,160
It's Lee Ji Han, huh?

248
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,410
Oh, that's it, huh?

249
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,740
The guest is leaving now.

250
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,920
Aren't you busy?

251
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,380
Was I mistaken about that, too?

252
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,400
I thought about this, and I don't think our give-and-take was fair.

253
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,080
Anyway, you honestly told me what you found out about me. Right?

254
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,930
So, honestly, let me tell you one thing, too.

255
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,490
It just bothers me after realizing your true feelings, CEO Yoon.

256
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,130
I'm sending you a message, so check it out.

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,080
How care she come here and make me sit here the whole time!

258
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,130
What the heck?

259
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,500
Hey, door!

260
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,360
It's me.

261
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,880
Why are you being shy now?

262
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,860
When did he change it?

263
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,080
Is it fingerprint recognition?

264
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,850
I think he changed the doorlock.

265
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,560
I guess so. It looks like he changed it.

266
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,940
I'm telling you this just in case.

267
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,540
But I'm not a thief or something.

268
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,590
I'm quite close to the resident here, but this thing was changed—

269
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,200
You're the one Do Han's marrying. Right?

270
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,720
Oh, do you know Do Han?

271
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,660
I've been very curious, but we meet like this.

272
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,860
It was a pleasure.

273
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,980
I'll see you again next time.

274
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,130
Who was that?

275
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,560
So, does he know him or not?

276
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,620
How can someone be so creepy?

277
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,220
I made you wait, huh?

278
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,410
Hey, Lee Do Han, am I an actor you already caught, huh?

279
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,840
What kind of a main character waits on the street?

280
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,480
Sorry.

281
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,190
What's this? I know that expression.

282
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,670
It's the one you make before giving someone trouble.

283
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,530
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

284
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,110
What? A family introduction out of nowhere?

285
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,980
Grandfather already created a task force for our wedding.

286
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,890
He wants us to choose the date and let him know right away.

287
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,650
Gosh, I'm getting stressed just thinking about it.

288
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,290
Do we really have to go that far?

289
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,860
Sorry.

290
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,000
But I thought it'd be better to get it over with.

291
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
You also saw what happens when reporters start tracking you.

292
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,330
Catching attention and becoming noisy happen in seconds.

293
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,650
We keep getting unnecessary extra scenes added on.

294
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,770
I'm also sorry about that.

295
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,200
Let's just do it next week.

296
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
Really? Will you be okay?

297
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,700
Of course, it's for real. Would I lie in this situation?

298
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,100
Though it may be fake, a marriage is still a marriage.

299
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,840
I think I've been too careless.

300
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,070
I should've planned and prepared for this before it dawned upon us.

301
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,840
Did you realize that only now?

302
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
How fast.

303
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,440
I'll do even better since I realized it late.

304
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,580
I'll give you the best version of whatever it is.

305
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,340
Okay, it looks like I'll finally get treated like a main character.

306
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,830
Let's give it a good try, though.

307
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,700
Let's do that.

308
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,190
Thank you for today.

309
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,710
I know, too.

310
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,630
Maybe I should've just been a writer.

311
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,040
I didn't know I was this good at writing scenarios.

312
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,140
- Take care now. 
 - I'm going in.

313
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,060
Oh, right, Do Han.

314
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,130
But we didn't talk about the most important thing.

315
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,560
Huh?

316
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,600
What does your brother do these days?

317
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,180
- Ji Han? 
 - I mean, he already hates me so much.

318
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,930
Wouldn't he get crazy angry if he found out our families were meeting?

319
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,210
I'll talk to him about it again.

320
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,950
No, I'll just do it myself.

321
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,710
This won't end until I get on Ji Han's good side anyway.

322
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,660
That's true, but will you be okay?

323
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,130
Why are you suddenly so worried?

324
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,420
Did you ever resolve issues? It was always me.

325
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,570
Let's make it simple without going through many people.

326
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,470
- I'm really going in now. 
 - Okay.

327
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,910
Let me know after you meet him.

328
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,900
- And call me if anything comes up. 
 - Okay.

329
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,100
All right, do you want some, too, Ji Ho?

330
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,570
There you go.

331
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,730
Thank you.

332
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,260
Goodness, my husband.

333
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,540
We're having a family introduction.

334
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,730
Why are you saying it so gravely?

335
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,060
Of course, we should.

336
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,450
Introducing your families to each other is the basics when you've decided to marry someone.

337
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,400
It's next week.

338
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,160
H-Hey, Sis.

339
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,720
You need to tell us these things in advance!

340
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,090
Seriously, how can you set the family introduction so suddenly?

341
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,910
It worked out that way.

342
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,500
But we don't need to prepare anything. We just need to be there.

343
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Still, I need to buy a suit and also a pair of dress shoes.

344
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,010
- What dress shoes? 
 - You threw away my only pair, saying they were too old!

345
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,010
While I'm at it, I need them tailored so my feet don't hurt.

346
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,150
Oh, that's right.

347
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,510
I also need to get skin treatment and a diet—

348
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,980
I've put on some weight lately.

349
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,780
Mom, are you the one getting married?

350
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,300
What skin treatment and diet? Just go!

351
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,620
A Jeong, the family introduction is where both families' first silent clash happens.

352
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,580
If your family's not prepared to match on a visual front,

353
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,500
you've already lost half the battle before it even began.

354
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,970
He's right. If we go unprepared, you'll be intimidated.

355
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,840
Based on how we look and what kind of class we show,

356
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,850
your fate of getting looked down on or not gets decided!

357
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,340
Hey, just go as usual and nothing more.

358
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,800
If we try to be something more, we're being more tacky.

359
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,740
- Okay. 
 - By the way, Aunt.

360
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,670
- Huh? 
 - Will I get to meet that uncle, then?

361
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,800
Which uncle?

362
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,330
The uncle who came to our house and bought my toy.

363
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,110
The uncle who bought your toy?

364
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,690
Yes.

365
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,190
 Are you feeling better? 

366
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,930
 You were soaked in the rain that day. 

367
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,420
Are his fingers laced with gold or something?

368
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,850
How hard is it to give a reply?

369
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,160
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

370
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,990
Manager, here.

371
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,780
I'll do it!

372
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,300
Ga Ram, this is the data for the presentation you mentioned.

373
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,110
Soo Jin, here's the data you were looking for.

374
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,860
Thank you.

375
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,010
Ji Han, it feels like you're doing all the work these days.

376
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,570
She's right. I saw you even skip lunch earlier

377
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,340
and emptying the trash can with the janitor.

378
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,780
It's fine.

379
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,860
It'd be good if my hard work could pay off for the company.

380
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,620
It feels like Ji Han has the owner mentality for this company.

381
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,320
Your professionalism is great.

382
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,070
Professionalism, my foot.

383
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,550
It's being dumb in work life.

384
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,950
Work all you want with an owner mentality and see if the company recognizes you.

385
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,100
The higher-ups probably don't even know our names.

386
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,420
Jong Soo, I emailed you the sales report you mentioned.

387
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,350
Please check it out.

388
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,190
 Please tell me now. 

389
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,870
What the heck are you working on?

390
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,950
What do you mean?

391
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,770
This is work, and that's work, too.

392
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,640
I've got work everywhere, so I'm not sure.

393
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,280
Please stop changing the subject.

394
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,950
Have I seen you for a day or two?

395
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,470
Something happened on the day you went to the memorial park, right?

396
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,340
Something did happen.

397
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,470
What on Earth happened there

398
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,520
that you're doing this to me?

399
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,820
What did I do?

400
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,450
Are you asking because you really don't know?

401
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,270
You're harassing me every day because you're on a Better Life Project.

402
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:00,700
 Breathe in as you move and breathe out. 

403
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,940
 Raise your butt in that pose and do the child's pose. 

404
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,200
You torture me before work at Miracle Morning

405
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,430
or whatever it was called. The yoga center.

406
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,880
 Please try reading it out loud. 

407
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,570
 There are some roads that you shouldn't cross. 

408
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,060
 I do not like her. 

409
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,660
 Hay cominos que no debes tomar. 
 (There are some roads that you shouldn't cross.) 

410
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,830
 Ella no me gusta. 
 (I do not like her.) 

411
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,750
 Il y a des limites a' ne pas franchir. 
 (There are some roads that you shouldn't cross.) 

412
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,890
 Je n'anime pas cette fille. 
 (I do not like her.) 

413
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,740
After work, you even call me out to the

414
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,000
language school for self-development and torture me until midnight.

415
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,740
- And that's not all. 
  - Hyung, why are you standing around? 

416
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,150
 Let's hurry up and go. 

417
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,320
 You're here. 

418
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,770
 - Hello.  
 - On the weekends, you even come

419
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,240
to my hobby activities and bother me all day these days!

420
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,720
Do you see these dark circles?

421
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,730
I can't do this any longer.

422
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,390
Please leave me out of the Better Life Project or whatever. Please!

423
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,460
Mom, how come there's nothing to eat at home?

424
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,750
Oh? What's this?

425
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,450
I got these for A Jeong's first birthday.

426
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,150
I didn't sell them even during the IMF

427
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,490
nor even when your dad's store was having a hard time.

428
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,220
So I could give them to A Jeong when she gets married.

429
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,450
Gosh, such a day has come.

430
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,560
It's sad for the second child.

431
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,490
You didn't give me stuff like this when I got married.

432
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,610
Why only for Sis?

433
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,020
- I knew you'd say that. Don't you remember? 
 - What?

434
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,970
You used up everything so you can go on a European trip!

435
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,580
- By the way, Mom... 
 - Yes?

436
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,640
Would Brother-in-law's family leave our family as we are?

437
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,410
What? You think they'll tell us to sell our home and send the money?

438
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,240
No, I mean, their family owns a major company.

439
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,450
So, they just might buy their in-laws a house or

440
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,890
buy them a large store and such, don't you think?

441
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,290
Don't say such a thing in front of your sister, even if it's a joke.

442
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,150
Did you sell your sister to them?

443
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,690
You and Tae Min's marriage

444
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,790
or A Jeong and Do Han's marriage. They're both my daughters' weddings.

445
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,090
But still, the formality needs to be met so there are no issues in and out of the family circle.

446
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,200
For example, what will you wear to the family introduction, Mom?

447
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,610
Do you even have anything to wear?

448
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,290
- I do. 
 - What?

449
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,790
The one I bought at the outlet a few days ago.

450
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,590
Mom, that's how you'll make Sis lose heart!

451
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,430
I told you. Based on how we look and what kind of class we show,

452
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,930
Sis's fate of getting looked down on or not gets decided.

453
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,770
Well...

454
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,340
I didn't really think that far.

455
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,180
Family introduction?

456
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,980
A Jeong, you're really getting married, huh?

457
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,990
I guess so.

458
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,830
Seriously, I guess I'm really getting married.

459
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,480
So, where's your wedding venue? Is it LJ Hotel?

460
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,250
I noticed that lots of conglomerates get married abroad.

461
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,370
Not sure. If it was up to me,

462
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,280
I just want to sign the papers and call it a day.

463
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,500
But if I really have to,

464
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,210
I just want to have noodles with my family somewhere like a buckwheat field.

465
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,690
Are you mad? Listen to yourself.

466
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,920
Hey, do you think you're Lee Na Young?

467
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,500
Do you know what the most important thing at a wedding is?

468
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,890
It's the food, girl.

469
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,450
All VIPs will be there if it's LJ.

470
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,540
Feed them noodles at a buckwheat field?

471
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,210
Hey, wake up!

472
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,480
It'll be harder to smooth things over the bigger deal this becomes.

473
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,010
What's there to smooth over?

474
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,770
You just need to avoid divorce later on.

475
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,790
Here comes another human we can't smooth over.

476
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,340
You know, the guy who showed up at the filming set, saying he was your fan.

477
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,590
- Welcome. 
 - Hi.

478
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,520
It's her flirt. The one I mentioned last time.

479
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,100
I heard that you were my fan.

480
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,600
O-Oh, yes. Yes, I did say that.

481
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,880
And you come here often.

482
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,980
Y-Yes, my work is nearby here—

483
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,150
And you work at LJ.

484
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,040
I've figured out the situation.

485
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,000
Where's Lee Ji Han?

486
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,470
Here are the new textbooks. Please pass them back.

487
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,980
 - Bonjour.  
 - What the heck is this?

488
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,160
 Oolala! 

489
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,220
Cutting class is the best thing to do when you have no motivation to learn.

490
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,340
 Popular songs. 

491
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:26,160
♫  Your memory, past love  ♫

492
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,800
♫  Become a thorn digging into me  ♫

493
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,380
♫  Please go—  ♫

494
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,990
   

495
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,880
 Cancel. 

496
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,400
Why did that woman have to work in so many different fields?

497
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,000
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but could you take a picture for us?

498
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
Oh, sure.

499
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,600
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

500
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,140
All right, here we go. One, two, three!

501
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,920
I'll take one more.

502
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,400
One, two!

503
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,480
What the heck? Did he treat me like a ghost just now?

504
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,700
- I apologize. 
 - Oh, thank you.

505
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,830
That apparition finally followed me into my home.

506
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,940
She's even greeting me.

507
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,200
You're home early.

508
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,460
You've been coming home late these days.

509
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,740
We had something to prepare for.

510
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,700
- We're having the family introduction. 
 - What?

511
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,580
This is seriously nuts.

512
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,350
What was that about?

513
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,220
He was lashing out at me, right?

514
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,560
He just didn't say anything.

515
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,100
No, I know Lee Ji Han, and he was lashing out just now.

516
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,890
Could you know my brother better than me?

517
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,340
He seems to be fine. Let's just finish what we were doing.

518
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,840
That's right, they want to

519
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,820
hold it at Grandfather's place, not a restaurant. What do you think?

520
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,160
A Jeong!

521
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,590
The location is...

522
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,570
That seems about done.

523
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,330
Aren't you hungry? You want to eat something?

524
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,150
All right, I'll go see if we have anything.

525
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,980
Did Ji Han have anything to eat?

526
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,120
I'll go and ask him!

527
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,350
Did you have dinner, by any chance?

528
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,920
If you didn't, join us right now—

529
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,940
I'm fine.

530
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,830
You saw me earlier at the park, right?

531
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,520
It's not like I'm invisible. Why do you keep ignoring me?

532
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,540
Your fingers are fine, but why are you ignoring my texts?

533
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:48,890
Wait... Are you mad because we're having the family introduction?

534
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,950
I won't make a scene like when I went to Grandfather's house to introduce myself.

535
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,360
So don't worry too much.

536
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,080
Why would I worry about you, Na A Jeong?

537
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,500
- What? 
 - You don't need to worry.

538
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,250
I won't be at the family introduction anyway.

539
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,810
If you're done, please leave.

540
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,430
I don't want to talk to you even within my space.

541
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,470
What about Ji Han?

542
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,680
Whatever, he's not eating.

543
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,480
And your brother said he's not coming to the family introduction.

544
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,200
- What? 
 - He's not coming.

545
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,300
Wait, I'll have a word with him.

546
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,020
Gosh, it's fine, really.

547
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,080
It's better if he doesn't come than to worry about what he'd do if he came.

548
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,350
It's actually for the better.

549
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,420
Honey, I've got a bad feeling for some reason.

550
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,650
Is it really okay to postpone Do Han's wedding?

551
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,860
I don't know, but I feel uneasy.

552
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,830
But Grandfather went and got the auspicious date in person

553
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,960
and made the list of guests, too.

554
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,630
It feels like we've been pushed aside for some reason.

555
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,820
You should've made some demands from Grandfather when we got married.

556
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,990
Gosh, why didn't you do anything like a fool?

557
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,940
You took my all.

558
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,920
So, I can't do anything without you.

559
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,780
So what?

560
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,540
You want me to give you some?

561
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,560
Will that be enough?

562
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,320
It won't be enough even if you give back everything.

563
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,620
Why are you picking a fight with busy people here?

564
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,890
I mean, so what?

565
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,550
What's your plan, Seung Ah?

566
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,990
Are we supposed to look out for Do Han whom Grandfather is rooting for

567
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,500
or for Ji Han whom Yoon Chae Won is rooting for?

568
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,460
My head hurts. Why's it so complicated? Nothing feels right!

569
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,650
Does your head hurt whenever something feels off? 
  (Spoken without honorifics) 

570
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,270
"Your"? You, you, you. You're really doing whatever now, huh?

571
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,150
You don't need to feel uneasy about those two. We can get rid of them both.

572
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,310
Easier said than done. You know how?

573
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,780
Yes.

574
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,600
You said your head hurts.

575
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,610
Give it some thought on your own.

576
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,640
Fighting.

577
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,480
She must be sensitive with the wedding coming up. Right?

578
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,120
No, judging from how she was talking to it last time,

579
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,350
she must have a story with the umbrella.

580
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,100
Do you get paid more for working like that?

581
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,220
CEO Yoon, what brings you here?

582
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,900
Let's go.

583
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,500
This is what you meant by destressing?

584
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,470
I thought we'd at least come out to play Mortal, or something like street racing.

585
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,520
They do have it here.

586
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,880
Over there.

587
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,800
And what's wrong with this? It's a healthy and safe way to destress.

588
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,760
You brought me to an arcade when I was in high school when I said I was depressed.

589
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,200
"Noona, you've got to destress right there and then.

590
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,960
But in a healthy and safe way.

591
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,670
Shooting fire at your opponent here is legal, so let loose."

592
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,600
I was cute even as a kid.

593
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,260
Seriously.

594
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,170
 Game over. 

595
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,880
One more round.

596
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,630
It kind of feels better getting beat up.

597
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,830
I mean,

598
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,430
I do deserve some beating.

599
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,870
What was that? You dissed me, right?

600
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,980
Yes, I did.

601
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,240
So, beat me up left and right, please.

602
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,400
All right!

603
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,980
How are your complicated thoughts? Did they get better?

604
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,370
I don't know if it got better or worse.

605
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,140
- How could you not go easy for once? 
 - I already am!

606
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,560
Gosh, I didn't come to make you feel better today in the first place.

607
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,370
I don't think I'm letting you win. I think I'm just losing.

608
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,560
- What? 
 - Something like that. You don't need to know.

609
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,160
Thank you for today.

610
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,970
You know, the thing I mentioned last time.

611
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,370
Inflammation caused by a small infection.

612
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,700
I thought it'd heal soon, but it got worse and

613
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,880
it festered when I thought it'd heal, giving me a hard time.

614
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,800
But I got to laugh a lot, thanks to you.

615
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,590
I relived the old times, too.

616
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,590
It was worth it, then.

617
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,010
Speaking of old times,

618
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,900
you used to like me back then. Right?

619
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,000
First love?

620
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
Why are you embarrassing me out of the blue?

621
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,590
So, I wasn't?

622
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,790
I mean, I was just immature back then.

623
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,260
How could I dare to like CEO Yoon?

624
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,680
Do you still have a small spark for me?

625
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,700
- What? 
 - If I blow on those feelings, would they rekindle?

626
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,770
Can I look through you?

627
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,700
I keep getting curious about a thing or two regarding you.

628
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,260
But I'm not sure if it's right to care about them or if it's okay to ask you.

629
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,600
So, I keep censoring myself, which is unlike me.

630
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,520
So, I'm going to settle it once and for all before moving on.

631
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,360
Lee Ji Han,

632
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,580
I jumped into the shopping mall business because of you, not Do Han.

633
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,450
- What? 
 - You still don't get it?

634
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,150
I'm saying I like you, Ji Han.

635
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,000
Wait.

636
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,540
W-What did you just say?

637
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,300
Give it some thought.

638
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,820
I won't wait long, though.

639
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,770
What's going on? You're just picking at your favorite mango-shaved ice.

640
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,560
I just have no appetite because it's cold.

641
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,280
You're cold?

642
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,580
You're crazy.

643
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,050
After meeting Na A Jeong,

644
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,940
these chills just won't go away.

645
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,660
Why on Earth did I betray Ji Han?

646
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,170
This is how a traitor must feel after giving in to the torture and confessing.

647
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,410
You were tortured by A Jeong? What torture?

648
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,900
Well, torturing the eyes.

649
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,910
- What? 
 - You see...

650
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,440
She stared at me like this, with those big eyes.

651
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,110
Taek, I get tortured every day in that sense.

652
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,690
Our chairman's eyes are even bigger.

653
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,380
Hyung, Na A Jeong wouldn't spill everything, right?

654
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,000
If he finds out I stabbed him in the back,

655
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,950
he'd turn around and slash me.

656
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,570
Never mind.

657
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:59,680
He doesn't seem to have the energy, judging from his recent condition.

658
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,840
You're late.

659
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,760
I guess you've got a lot of work lately.

660
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,680
Yes, I have a lot of work lately.

661
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,870
Are you really not coming to the family introduction?

662
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,140
Let's talk next time.

663
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,380
I'm a bit tired today.

664
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,570
Let's take a look at what happened, shall we?

665
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,600
Who is this?

666
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,560
Whoa, this is a house?

667
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,400
This is a house.

668
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,320
They're all houses people live in.

669
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,130
They've got nothing on us, so hold your head up high.

670
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,450
It's this way.

671
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,510
- Gosh, how do you do? 
 - Hello.

672
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,830
- Welcome. 
 - O-Oh, yes.

673
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,580
I'm Hyeon Dae Ho, Do Han's grandfather.

674
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,880
The baby came, too.

675
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,600
Hello, sir.

676
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,110
Well, thank you.

677
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,640
You must be uncomfortable for inviting all of you to my home for our first time meeting.

678
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,550
Thank you for coming all this way.

679
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,110
Not at all, goodness.

680
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,420
Thanks to you, I get to come and see a house I've only seen on TV.

681
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,110
All right, then.

682
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,940
Let's take our time to introduce ourselves over the meal.

683
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,950
- Let us move over now. 
 - It's this way.

684
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,820
Yes, yes.

685
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,900
- All right, let's have a toast. 
 - Yes.

686
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,300
I'm pleased to meet you, and

687
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:38,280
I'm grateful that you let my grandson take the daughter you raised so devotedly.

688
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,600
Gosh, not at all.

689
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,630
My child's still lacking in may ways. Please take good care of her.

690
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,250
 The actual talk begins. 

691
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,080
 After that, this will probably be the first obstacle. 

692
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,540
 - Money? 
 - Yes. 

693
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,890
 But if things go south from here, 

694
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,740
 that's when the battle for pride begins. 

695
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,570
 I think I can take care of my parents one way or the other. 

696
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:07,140
How shall we take care of the dowry and gifts?

697
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,260
I don't think you'll have to worry too much about that.

698
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,770
I think we can skip over such formality.

699
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,440
But shouldn't we still prepare what we have to?

700
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,350
- The elders are talking here. 
 - Why?

701
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,550
I wonder if people would even notice them.

702
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,720
Who would even notice them? It's no use.

703
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,050
 - But the problem is Soo Jeong.  
 - Sorry?

704
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,430
 She can't stand not having the last word. 

705
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,540
What did you just say?

706
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,460
What do you mean?

707
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,900
I didn't say anything.

708
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,160
- Please help yourselves. 
 - Yes.

709
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,920
We agreed to skip on the dowry and gifts as well.

710
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,580
We got simple rings like these a while back, too.

711
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,500
- Good job. 
 - Gosh, you should've told me.

712
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,850
By the way, what do you do for a living?

713
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,330
- I write novels. 
 - Oh, which novel?

714
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:08,070
- I haven't published any. I'm just writing on my own. 
 - I see.

715
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,900
You can be a golfer if you go to the golf range.

716
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,700
Our ahjumma must be a chef.

717
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,300
What's with you?

718
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,770
 Choi Min Woong is a problem, too. 

719
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,000
 He'll probably look down on and pick a fight with the easiest person in your family. 

720
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,330
 Really? 

721
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,400
 That'd be my brother-in-law. 

722
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,900
 What should I do? 

723
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,800
 - Does he get hurt easily? 
 - N-No, what I meant was, 

724
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,830
 your brother, not my brother-in-law. 

725
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,740
 My brother-in-law is what you call a madman with dim eyes. 

726
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,510
By the way, how many more accidents will you cause?

727
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,870
Accidents?

728
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,780
The thing is, I actually bought some of your family's stocks.

729
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,380
But there were a few crises, you see.

730
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,050
Whenever I thought I was on the rise,

731
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,580
there's stock price manipulation, power abuse controversy,

732
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,880
- and drunk driving— 
 - She's the one who drove drunk.

733
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,170
- I apologize. 
 - It wasn't me.

734
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,630
Those big issues kept popping up.

735
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,820
So, it's nothing big.

736
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,660
If you could tell me when you'll stop causing problems...

737
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,260
- It'll be helpful to this ape's investing endeavors. 
 - Sure thing.

738
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,490
- Thank you. 
 - Help yourself.

739
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,530
You look hungry. Please help yourself.

740
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,350
In-law,

741
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:29,220
after the marriage announcement, the press release we prepared will be released soon.

742
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,050
We'll leave out A Jeong's identity as much as we can.

743
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,400
So you don't need to worry too much.

744
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,930
Sorry?

745
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,340
Why would you leave out her identity?

746
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,850
- A Jeong, the thing is— 
 - Announcing it as it is

747
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,440
would be a bit too much, wouldn't it?

748
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,660
It'd be uncomfortable for both families in many ways.

749
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,110
It could also affect the company's stock price.

750
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,880
That's right!

751
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,150
I mean, we can't affect Tae Min's economic endeavors.

752
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,280
- Of course. 
 - Yes.

753
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,260
That's enough.

754
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,110
We, her parents, are the ones who are lacking.

755
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,480
Not my child.

756
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,850
In-law, that's not what I meant.

757
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,620
If not, why are you covering her up?

758
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,970
- Mom. 
 - Why are you covering up a perfectly fine girl?

759
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,150
- Mother— 
 - Because we want to protect her.

760
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,040
Ji Han.

761
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,970
Once the marriage is announced, the entire media will harass Na A Jeong.

762
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,570
But Na A Jeong probably won't get hurt.

763
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,790
She told me this before.

764
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:44,080
That she doesn't get hurt by irrelevant people talking about her.

765
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,550
But I noticed...

766
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:52,310
she struggles watching people get hurt in front of her.

767
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,350
So, I don't think you need to worry too much.

768
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:02,260
What does it matter what other people say?

769
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,940
We all know what's in there.

770
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,170
And what does it matter if we don't know?

771
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,900
Na A Jeong's aware of it already.

772
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,840
That she's a really great person.

773
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,560
That's right.

774
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,890
He's right, In-law.

775
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,920
We'll cherish the daughter you have raised so devotedly.

776
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,200
If it made you upset, please forgive me.

777
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,280
All right, help yourselves.

778
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,250
Yes.

779
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,170
Do Han, are the rides ready?

780
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,240
- Yes. 
 - Gosh, it's fine. We have our ride ready.

781
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,440
I'll see you again next time.

782
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,720
- Yes... 
 - Thank you.

783
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,280
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - We'll get going.

784
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,760
- I won't go out too far. 
 - Yes, yes.

785
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,600
Let's go now.

786
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,790
Watch the steps.

787
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,180
Ji Ho, come here! Let's go.

788
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,630
- Mom. 
 - Yes?

789
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,060
I thought he was an arrogant brat who would bother her, but now I see him in a different light.

790
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,260
- A Jeong. 
 - I know.

791
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,150
Regarding the press release...

792
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,080
Oh, it's okay.

793
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,690
You don't need to explain.

794
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,150
I heard it all earlier, too.

795
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,160
A Jeong!

796
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,600
There's traffic. Hurry up and get in!

797
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,880
Go ahead without me.

798
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,240
I've got something to do.

799
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,360
We'll get going, then.

800
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,450
- You're leaving now, right? 
 - Yes.

801
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,830
- Good job. 
 - Thanks.

802
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:07,370
 You're answering my calls now. 

803
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,540
 Let's meet up. 

804
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,780
You know, right?

805
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,860
I can't hold back my curiosity.

806
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:25,550
Why did you come to the family introduction?

807
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,890
Isn't it weirder if I don't come?

808
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,910
I'm Brother's family.

809
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,120
Well, that's right.

810
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,940
It's weirder,

811
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,110
but you said you weren't coming.

812
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,830
You called me out to get technical about that?

813
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:45,490
No, that's not exactly the case.

814
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
No matter how I think about this,

815
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,800
I think it's right to say this to you in person.

816
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,450
I was concerned because you said you weren't coming,

817
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,980
I was glad you came and thankful you defended me.

818
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,200
It's fine.

819
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,590
I didn't do it to hear you say that.

820
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,460
But you ultimately made me say these things.

821
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,510
I gave it some thought.

822
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,320
I think you could hurt me now, Lee Ji Han.

823
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,860
But aren't we involved in each other's lives at this point?

824
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:46,510
♫  It was so nice when we shared those heartwarming words  ♫

825
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,310
You were going to come in the end.

826
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,820
But why did you act so mean in the beginning?

827
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,400
Because I didn't want to see you.

828
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,780
But why did you suddenly have a change of heart?

829
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,270
Despite my feelings, I felt like I had to see you, Na A Jeong.

830
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,790
Let's be honest now that everything's over now.

831
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,110
You came to cause a scene there, right?

832
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:19,000
I thought you were just shameless. I guess you don't know how to read the room.

833
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,500
You just found that out? I lack a lot of things.

834
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,060
I don't have money, conscience,

835
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,440
and I don't even have patience, so answer me now.

836
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,000
What sudden change of heart did you have?

837
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,700
I think I finally see a little bit now.

838
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,280
The choice that will lead me the right way.

839
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,000
The fact that I went there...

840
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,750
means I'll acknowledge it.

841
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:53,950
♫  Isn't it the same for you, too?  ♫

842
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,160
Acknowledge what?

843
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,570
You and my brother.

844
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,190
So, try your best to be happy...

845
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,270
with my brother.

846
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:06,960


847
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:12,210
   

848
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,940
   

849
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,690
 Let's be happy. It's nothing fancy, is it? 

850
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,310
 My brother and Na A Jeong are nesting in my house. 

851
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:45,070
 The person I will marry meets someone who knows me by chance? 

852
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:48,040
 You better not mess with A Jeong. 

853
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,710
   
 Marriage Contract? 

854
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,620
 - Come here! 
 - W-What is it? 

855
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,820
 I should do this much as your brother-in-law, Sister-in-law. 

856
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:58,300
 Why do you keep adding "Sister-in-law" at the end of everything you say? 

857
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,630
 Brother-in-law, Brother-in-law, Brother-in-law. 

858
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,100
 I'd like you to keep your place. 

859
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,750
 Lee Ji Han, are you really okay with me marrying Do Han?
