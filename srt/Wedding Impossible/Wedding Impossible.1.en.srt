00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:24,794
LEE JI-HAN

2
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:34,261
I've never felt it before

3
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,347
No one

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,266
Has ever taught it to me before

5
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,603
My heart's about to explode

6
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,648
I can't take it anymore

7
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,608
I want to love you

8
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,610
I want to take care of you

9
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,612
I want to live with you

10
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,950
Even if I can have the whole world

11
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,913
It would be meaningless

12
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,333
Without you

13
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,758
Congratulations.

14
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:16,011
That was sung by So-jin,
the bride's best friend.

15
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,304
Next, we'll be...

16
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,306
Wait. Hang on.

17
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,769
I have something
I'd like to say to my friend.

18
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,773
As of this moment,

19
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:32,111
I'm stepping down
from my place as the bride's best friend.

20
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,529
And from now on,

21
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,450
the groom here will take my place.

22
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,371
You'd better make Ji-eun happy.

23
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,914
Pinky promise?

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,208
Promise me.

25
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,546
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

26
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,341
Congratulations!

27
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,725
You guys look so nice!

28
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,394
Go, it's a video.

29
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,739
I usually just sing
one verse for my clients,

30
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,199
but I sang more just for you.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,619
Well, the song didn't stop,

32
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,537
and you looked great together.

33
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,622
Thank you.

34
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,624
Is this the account?

35
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,042
TRANSFER TO NA A-JUNG

36
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,544
Yes, but I'm not using the buffet,

37
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,838
so send me half of the meal price.

38
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,257
Great.

39
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,470
How should I send you the photos
I took earlier? Airdrop?

40
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,096
Oh, I don't have that.

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,015
Through the messenger, then.

42
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,143
By the way,

43
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,230
you're really good at acting.

44
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,273
Really?

45
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,317
You actually cried.

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,443
Thanks.

47
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,819
My husband said

48
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,364
he didn't know I had such a close friend.

49
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,199
-He was touched.
-I see.

50
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,576
He was worried I didn't have friends.

51
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,205
Tell him to stop worrying
and be good to you.

52
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:07,915
-What?
-You know.

53
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,584
I'm a fake best friend you paid for,

54
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,586
but your husband is real.

55
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,464
-Right.
-Anyway, congrats.

56
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,049
For real.

57
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,301
-Was it okay?
-You were great.

58
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,762
Where did I put it?

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,977
Looking for this?

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,312
You hold this when you're anxious.

61
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,732
You're not family.

62
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,235
Why are you here?

63
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,530
You can't make me sell that land.

64
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,116
Father.

65
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,868
Don't be so harsh on him.

66
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,789
Ji-han's our family too.
You know how good he's been to us.

67
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,917
He helped with our farm last year.

68
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,128
-The year before that too.
-Really?

69
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,797
And when you hurt your back,

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,510
he was the one who took you
to the hospital and took care of you!

71
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,345
You think he did that

72
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,930
just out of kindness?

73
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,974
He obviously wanted something.

74
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,270
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
I should just go.

76
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,607
I'll be outside.

77
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,526
Father!

78
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,738
Darn it.

79
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,032
Let's sell this land.

80
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,908
What?

81
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,201
It's fine. Stop.

82
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,120
Stay out of this. Father.

83
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,290
Mother wouldn't have suffered
if we'd sold it.

84
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,583
Ho-tae...

85
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,376
If you don't sell it now,

86
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,380
I'll never see you again. Is that okay?

87
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,006
Is this how you apologize?

88
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,050
You should apologize.

89
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,344
You stepped on my paper.

90
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,931
Whatever that costs,

91
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,476
I'm sure it's worth nothing compared

92
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:34,812
to this.

93
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,231
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

94
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,358
Is that so?

95
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,902
All right, then.

96
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,908
Here. Sorry.

97
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,660
Now we're even.

98
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,915
What's with her?

99
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,800
Do-han!

100
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,678
Coming to Korea?

101
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,929
So suddenly?

102
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,722
He's coming? When?

103
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,609
EPISODE 1

104
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,263
Excuse me, sir.

105
00:07:58,729 --> 00:07:59,938
Chae-won.

106
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:01,982
Hey.

107
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,567
Sit.

108
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,860
What...

109
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,446
Hey. When did you come to New York?

110
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,323
We may get married.

111
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,868
See that man there?

112
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,453
He's a reporter.

113
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:19,166
Once we launch our home furnishing brand,
we'll be in a dating scandal.

114
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,084
That was you?

115
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,129
You had someone follow me around?

116
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,964
Do-han.

117
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,175
You're mistaken.

118
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,593
I didn't bring him.

119
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,845
Ji-han sent him.

120
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,099
Your grandfather and my father are trying

121
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,352
to set us up together.

122
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,272
They want to fix my flaw as a divorcee.

123
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,733
And my brother wants to marry me off.

124
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,903
It would be much better
to marry your brother.

125
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
What?

126
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,450
Your brother's actually more my style.

127
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,160
Ji-han's cute.

128
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,581
You can adore him all you want.
And marry him if you can.

129
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,667
So what do we do?

130
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,127
We might really get married.

131
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,391
Hello.

132
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,184
Out here in the cold again?

133
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,269
You're here.

134
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,353
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

135
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,938
I'll buy all the jujubes.

136
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,439
All of them?

137
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,901
You're always so kind. Thank you.

138
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm grateful to get
such delicious jujubes.

139
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,282
It'll get really cold today.

140
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,533
-So go home early.
-Okay.

141
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,617
-Okay?
-Sure.

142
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,704
It's not just the hotel.

143
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,957
Having a science facility

144
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,001
will make it stand out

145
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,336
among the existing local competitors.

146
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,548
Plus, an indoor sports theme park,

147
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,718
a multiplex theater,
and an innovative aquarium.

148
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,262
Our new shopping mall

149
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,180
will easily become a landmark

150
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,640
of Myeongju.

151
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,726
Our plans weren't stopped

152
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,936
because it was lacking.

153
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,647
There are holdouts in that area.

154
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,899
We need to get rid of them first.

155
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:08,984
Does that mean

156
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,986
if we take care of them,

157
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,280
you'll let us proceed

158
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,615
with the shopping mall?

159
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,253
Then let us proceed, because we did it.

160
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,636
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

161
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,192
Wrap things up for me.

162
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,443
-Yes, sir.
-Bye.

163
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,527
Great job today.

164
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,658
What are you doing here? Follow me.

165
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,746
This is a very easy situation to read.

166
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,373
Sorry, sir.

167
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,084
Thanks, guys.

168
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,716
Ji-han took care of the holdouts,

169
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,512
but our leader's still
treating him like his slave.

170
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,681
I know. If I were him, I'd be so grateful.

171
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,685
Plus, he'll get a promotion
once the shopping mall's built.

172
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,313
Who knows? Ji-han could be trying to climb

173
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,606
the social ladder.

174
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,857
-What?
-What?

175
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,570
You know, there are rumors
about our leader

176
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,533
actually being the chairman's grandson.

177
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,045
Mr. Easy-han.

178
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,214
Oh, sorry, sir.

179
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,093
Mr. Lee. You were amazing, like always.

180
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,638
So easily taking care of those holdouts!

181
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,392
HOLDOUT'S SON KIM HO-TAE

182
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,185
What's the point?

183
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,772
A reliable brother,

184
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,858
a hard-working employee.

185
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,403
But my grandfather doesn't recognize it.

186
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,074
Damn it.

187
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,328
Still, everyone knows
how good you are at work.

188
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,373
Your awesome reputation

189
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,959
will soon reach the chairman's ears.

190
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,129
Maybe he heard about it already.

191
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,051
I just heard that his lawyer
stopped by his house.

192
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,636
He's there to amend his will.

193
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,722
Really?

194
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,974
Then he called Do-han back...

195
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,561
I think you'll have good news this time.

196
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,484
He must've arrived by now.

197
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,072
Do-han!

198
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,699
Hey!

199
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,367
What's going on?

200
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,578
-What...
-Why do you look

201
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,913
so good when it was

202
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,706
a 14-hour flight?

203
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,250
You don't smell,

204
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,961
and you still look great.

205
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,506
I called a cab since you were busy.

206
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,050
I was. I almost couldn't come.

207
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,134
But I just barely

208
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,471
managed to make the time for you.

209
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:29,017
Why? Because my best friend of 15 years
was finally coming to Korea.

210
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,852
-I'm touched.
-Let's go.

211
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,064
You have a car? Since when?

212
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,941
Since I was born?

213
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,403
How was the drive?

214
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,989
Fine. And your flight?

215
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,788
What?

216
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,374
Who is this?

217
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,834
Who do you mean?

218
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,586
A girl.

219
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,880
Laughing with Do-han.

220
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,890
THE EMPRESS'S DREAM
EPISODE 4

221
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,686
I knew you could do it, A-jung.

222
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,982
Just five years ago,
you kept saying you'd quit acting.

223
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,943
Congratulations.
See? I knew you'd succeed.

224
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,448
If you're happy for me,
then forget my past.

225
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,033
It's a new beginning.

226
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,869
Right, tell me.

227
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,913
When's your first series airing?

228
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,748
Series?

229
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,668
Enough about me. What about you?

230
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,504
Why are you here for a month?

231
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,466
I'm just visiting
because my grandpa's sick.

232
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,051
What?

233
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,470
You said he was sick before.

234
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,973
Is it really bad this time?

235
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,767
I think he was just faking it.
I got fooled.

236
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:59,065
Come to think of it, I haven't heard
anything about your family before.

237
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,192
Forget it.

238
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,282
The Joint Investigation Headquarters
of Financial Crime

239
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,284
prosecuted Executive Director Choi

240
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,287
of LJ Hotel on suspicions
of stock manipulation.

241
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,413
Grandfather.

242
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,415
Please forgive him.

243
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,127
He was just trying to do a good job.

244
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:25,133
He always said he wanted to be
helpful to you by expanding his business.

245
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,719
Seung-a,

246
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,804
have you talked to the legal team?

247
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,350
The unrealized profits
won't be taken into account,

248
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,479
so he'll probably get probation, Grandpa.

249
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,815
Technically, it wasn't
even false information.

250
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,110
China was positive
about the exclusive contract,

251
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:49,824
but they suddenly became hesitant.
I don't know why.

252
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,877
I'm sorry I'm late.

253
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,600
I'd love to have coffee with you too,
but they keep calling me.

254
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,643
All right.

255
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,144
Thanks.

256
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,188
-Go on.
-Okay.

257
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,691
Let's go have
our favorite noodles next time.

258
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,775
-Sure.
-Okay.

259
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:24,859
Thank you.

260
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,361
-Bye.
-Bye.

261
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,487
Sorry.

262
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,738
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

263
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,906
-Bye.
-Bye!

264
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,949
Bye!

265
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,254
Did I leave something?

266
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,296
No.

267
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,590
I left something behind.

268
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,300
Check your pockets.

269
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,385
My pockets?

270
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:53,972
Hang on.

271
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:01,062
You might never be able
to get noodles if you wait for me.

272
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,105
So just eat it.

273
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,026
And get some nice coffee
and go enjoy a sauna.

274
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,903
They're awesome here.

275
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,115
-A-jung, you--
-Do-han.

276
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,284
You told me once

277
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,162
that friends should be about giving,

278
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,539
not just receiving.

279
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,916
Did I say that?

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,543
Anyway, enjoy your noodles

281
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,420
and send me a pic.

282
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,964
I have to go now.

283
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,767
I'm almost there.

284
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,866
You're late.

285
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,284
I was so anxious.

286
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,661
-There was a flight delay.
-Let's hurry.

287
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,871
Is he furious?

288
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,081
Slave number three took your outfit.

289
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,417
Ji-ae took it off, and I ran away with it.

290
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,711
I see. You're awesome.

291
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,379
I'll go change into these.

292
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,714
Let me ask a favor.

293
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,799
What?

294
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,175
Get me a coffee.

295
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,510
You know what to get.

296
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,928
Please?

297
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,179
See you later.

298
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,806
Who ordered you to do it?

299
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,557
I did nothing wrong!

300
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,811
Continue until they confess their sins!

301
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,312
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

302
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,113
Cut! Okay!

303
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,990
Cut! That was good.

304
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,465
A caffe latte.

305
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,510
No syrup, fat-free, with an extra shot.

306
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,387
It's your favorite.

307
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,140
Please.

308
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,396
Goodness... I already found someone else.

309
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,358
Let me off just once. I've never
been late before. You know that.

310
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,526
If I let you off,

311
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,987
then I'll have to do that for everyone.

312
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,781
-I was never late. Please?
-Will you stop?

313
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:17,991
-Just once!
-No!

314
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,158
What are you doing?

315
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,451
It's an emergency!

316
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,495
-Yes, sir.
-We need to talk.

317
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,788
Oh, come on!

318
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,290
I'm busy, so stop this.

319
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,541
-Darn it...
-Jeez.

320
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,085
Coming!

321
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,796
Damn it.

322
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,007
I know horses are scary.

323
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,509
But you were fine riding one yesterday.

324
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,304
You said you could do it.

325
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,472
You bragged about it on TV.

326
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,516
You can't do this!

327
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,767
Director,

328
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,020
she really wants to do it,

329
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,646
but she's traumatized now.

330
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,231
Traumatized overnight?

331
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,859
Did you fall? Are you okay?

332
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,569
No, it's not that.

333
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,489
She almost got her hand bit
while giving a carrot.

334
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,954
How will I reschedule everything?

335
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,374
What about the double?

336
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,043
Well, it's...

337
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,503
She got in an accident and will be late.

338
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,757
When will we ever start filming?

339
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,342
I...

340
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:18,927
I can do it.

341
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,095
I can ride horses.

342
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,567
She's good.

343
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,277
When did she learn that?

344
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,613
She said she learned it just in case.

345
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,156
But she looks familiar.

346
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,825
Didn't she do the underwater shoot?

347
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,037
Yes, she learned
scuba diving just in case too.

348
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,956
She learned a lot of things.

349
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,668
-Cut.
-Cut!

350
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,752
Come back.

351
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,841
Just this once.

352
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,009
Okay.

353
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,594
Get ready, everyone.

354
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:10,228
You're the best
at getting people on your side.

355
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,854
Ji-ae,

356
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,148
thanks so much.

357
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,069
Your car ran so smoothly.

358
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,487
Thanks, Jong-hee.

359
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,448
I carried it around
as though it were my organ.

360
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,495
Acting in front of the director
and your friend?

361
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,831
You're so busy today, A-jung.

362
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,584
I know. I never knew
I was so good at improv acting.

363
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,421
I was anxious before I left,

364
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,674
but when I saw Do-han,
I started acting so smoothly.

365
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,343
You should be the main actress.

366
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,763
We were on standby for hours
because of Hong Na-ri.

367
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,766
But Do-han's your bestie.

368
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,309
Why are you lying?

369
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm not lying, I'm acting.

370
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,814
What's so wrong about getting minor roles?

371
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,275
You're just wasting your energy lying.

372
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,405
Hey, Gen MZ. I guess you've never
embarrassed yourself.

373
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,867
A piece of advice,

374
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,120
don't get drunk with a friend.

375
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,583
But if you do end up drunk,
never hit anyone.

376
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,792
So you mean

377
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,045
she beat you up?

378
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,798
How many times do I have to tell you?

379
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,343
That woman was all drunk and beat us up!

380
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,137
-Look at our faces!
-No.

381
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:30,224
You're the ones
who tricked me into filming porn.

382
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,477
You said it was a one-take

383
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,606
indie film that you're handing in
for a film festival!

384
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:41,778
You call that an indie film?
Porn shot in a cheap motel?

385
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,780
I want her punished.

386
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,490
Send her to jail!

387
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,325
-You go to jail!
-A-jung.

388
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,160
A-jung, calm down.

389
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,287
You go to jail!

390
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,290
Everyone, please be quiet!

391
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:56,918
So you mean

392
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,838
those two people were drunk

393
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,882
and barged into the motel room

394
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,842
where you three were in,

395
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,720
and suddenly beat you up? Together?

396
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,723
No, not together. It was just her!

397
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,600
Just her?

398
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,935
She's

399
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,270
skilled at martial arts.

400
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,689
I learned it

401
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,025
just in case.

402
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,365
Darn it.

403
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,911
I did nothing wrong!

404
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,037
Well said.

405
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,457
I'm really going to quit acting.

406
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:42,088
Hey, don't let them affect you.
You've done great so far.

407
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,174
They say opportunities
are bald in the back.

408
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,927
When they pass by,
you can't pull them back.

409
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,973
But I can't seize them even when they're

410
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,183
right in front of me.

411
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,478
I thought it was a great opportunity.

412
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,069
Don't cry, A-jung.

413
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,780
You'll find a good opportunity.

414
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,158
My gosh.

415
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,454
But I still haven't found one,
and I'm still doing this.

416
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,250
It's embarrassing.

417
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,796
He got recognized
for his work in New York,

418
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,048
but I'm still doing minor roles.

419
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,426
It's quite sad

420
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:33,514
when you and your close friend
are suddenly in different worlds

421
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,601
when you used to be in the same one.

422
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,685
Right.

423
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,939
But he'll be back in New York
after a month.

424
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,942
And he'll forget about my TV series
once he's busy.

425
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,612
I just want him to see

426
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,823
that I'm doing well while he's here.

427
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,533
I just don't want him

428
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,744
to feel sad when he thinks about me.

429
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,996
Hey, don't be harsh on yourself.

430
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,290
It's nice to see you working so hard.

431
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,374
Really?

432
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,294
-But I--
-A-jung!

433
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,589
A-jung!

434
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,050
A-jung!

435
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,593
A-jung!

436
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:14,388
A-jung! Great job!

437
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,183
Thanks for riding the horse instead of me.

438
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,268
No, I actually got a great chance.

439
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,270
You're so kind.

440
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,485
I should've stayed
in the horseback riding club. Like you.

441
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,029
Well, you can still

442
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,240
get lead roles regardless.

443
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,116
You get lots of roles too.

444
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,118
Isn't that right?

445
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,913
Didn't we meet in a lot of shows?

446
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,917
Right, we keep seeing each other.

447
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,377
Anyway,

448
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,755
it's so nice to see each other
on film sets, isn't it?

449
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,590
-Right.
-Let's meet up later.

450
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,426
Contact my manager and set a date.

451
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,594
-Okay?
-Okay.

452
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,221
-Sure.
-Great.

453
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,305
-Sure.
-Sure.

454
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,640
-Great.
-Nice.

455
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,724
Go on.

456
00:25:58,808 --> 00:25:59,850
Get some rest.

457
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,477
Good job today.

458
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,145
-Bye.
-Bye.

459
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,480
See you later!

460
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,651
-Na-ri!
-Director!

461
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,152
You were awesome!

462
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,366
Well, I guess it's not always nice.

463
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,368
She was your classmate, right?

464
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,370
Yes.

465
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,330
A-jung was more popular then.

466
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:25,334
She's acting like that on purpose
to rub it in.

467
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:27,962
It's fine.

468
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,755
Let's go.

469
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,840
Let's go.

470
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,272
Do-han. Ask him yourself.

471
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:50,484
You kept asking if Grandpa was okay.

472
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,820
-Me?
-Yes, you.

473
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,867
No need for fake concern.

474
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,623
I met our lawyer
and amended my will today.

475
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,336
I'm getting it notarized soon.

476
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,840
Let's just talk with everyone present.

477
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:16,719
Do-han.

478
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,515
Marry Chae-won from Taeyang Group.

479
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,893
When you get married,

480
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,644
I'll hand over

481
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,521
the management rights.

482
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,607
-Grandpa!
-Grandfather!

483
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,192
-No!
-Quiet!

484
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:38,532
Do you know what I'm the most proud of
after leading the company by myself?

485
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,745
It's that I've never gotten
summoned by the Prosecution.

486
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,164
But my grandchildren

487
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,124
create scandals

488
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,669
like stock price manipulation,

489
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,714
power-tripping, drunk driving.

490
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,843
No one in this family
is normal except these two.

491
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,639
But still,

492
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,517
he doesn't know a thing about management.

493
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,811
And the shareholders?

494
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,312
They won't agree.

495
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,273
That's why he should marry Chae-won.

496
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,234
She's from Taeyang Group,

497
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,445
so no one will challenge them.

498
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:17,905
Do-han.

499
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:23,577
This isn't sudden.
You should've married her five years ago.

500
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,455
Whatever the reason, just get married.

501
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,707
I'll assume

502
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,293
you'll do so, and announce

503
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,464
the succession
at my birthday party officially.

504
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,715
Chae-won and I

505
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,301
discussed it already.

506
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,346
What?

507
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,181
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,767
We both don't want this.

509
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:47,893
I won't do it.

510
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,311
What?

511
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,038
How could you say no?

512
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,459
You're not a kid.

513
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,044
You're 32, okay?

514
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,714
Why are you suddenly rebelling?

515
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,259
Min-woong and Seung-a.

516
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,762
I worked so hard
so I wouldn't end up like them.

517
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,683
I joined the Marine Corps
when Chois evaded doing military service.

518
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,102
Salute!

519
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,480
They got positions through connections,

520
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,566
but I started at the bottom.

521
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,613
And when they attended
luxury brand events,

522
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,781
I attended

523
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:47,119
environmental group events
and cleaned up trash. You know that?

524
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,416
Hey, I don't want carrots.

525
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,128
You can't be picky like this about work.

526
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,380
Jeez.

527
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,927
Go tell Grandpa that it was a mistake.

528
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,804
No. I don't want to marry her.

529
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,390
You should. You'll get the company.

530
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,726
Why do you hate her?

531
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,437
I just don't want to marry her.

532
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,147
So why not?

533
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,440
Because it's her.

534
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,858
So why do you hate...

535
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,236
Are you kidding me?

536
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,322
How can marry someone I don't love?

537
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,032
Why are you pestering me?

538
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:28,327
You can just develop feelings
for her later.

539
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,246
You can't miss this chance to take over.

540
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,083
If it's so easy,
you can marry her and take over instead.

541
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,044
Right, Terry? Right?

542
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,339
He won't give it to me.

543
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,299
Just you.

544
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,760
Don't make me say it.

545
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,055
-Ji-han.
-So just take the deal.

546
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,224
I'm doing the hard work for you.

547
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,559
That looks delicious.

548
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,603
I'm doing my best
not to ruin your reputation.

549
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,400
Do-han.

550
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:03,571
In sports, a skilled player
can change the whole team.

551
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,574
I'm sure Chae-won will be a great help.

552
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,659
Your cooking skills improved.

553
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,996
So just enjoy everything
I prepare for you.

554
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,124
You don't even drive them.
Can't you just sell them?

555
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,417
They're pretty.

556
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,837
Do you have something hidden in New York?

557
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,547
Something hidden?

558
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,215
A secret lover, maybe?

559
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,223
You do, right?

560
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,102
That's why you're saying no. Is it her?

561
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:36,604
Who?

562
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,317
The girl from the airport.

563
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,405
Did you send that reporter?

564
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,493
I sent him to spy on Chae-won.

565
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,162
Hey. Ji-han.

566
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,206
Did you put a tail on me in New York?

567
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,169
You never told me your New York address.

568
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,588
I trust you, but you don't.

569
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,176
Then you were hiding there
because of her, right?

570
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,511
Fine. She's my girlfriend.

571
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,055
-So what?
-What?

572
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,806
-For real?
-Yes.

573
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,768
So don't tell me
to marry someone else, okay?

574
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,895
Bye.

575
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,576
By the way, why didn't A-jung come today?

576
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,162
She's busy.

577
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,956
Right. Shooting a drama series?

578
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,169
She only appears for one second.
Why is she so busy?

579
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:47,174
The film set's far away, so we barely
see her these days too. Right?

580
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,926
That's not true.

581
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,553
I see her every day.

582
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,889
We watched TV together yesterday.

583
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,643
He likes A-jung so much.

584
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,145
-Right?
-No matter how busy,

585
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,023
she should come when we're all gathering.

586
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:06,026
You always nag her about getting married.

587
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,486
Come on, Dae-sub.

588
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,364
It's better to just marry
some handsome guy

589
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,825
if things aren't working out well.

590
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,743
It's all for her sake.

591
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,996
We're out of eggs.

592
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,957
I'll go get more.

593
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,000
Mom, can I have some water?

594
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,377
I want some juice.

595
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:29,925
No parent would reject their children
coming to the family memorial service.

596
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,095
Why didn't you take me?

597
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:36,348
How could you go without telling me?

598
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,433
Are you ashamed?

599
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,185
Don't you want me as your daughter?

600
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,688
Who on earth

601
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,108
keeps eating my ice cream
without filling it up?

602
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,070
Honey.

603
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,782
Should we just marry A-jung off?

604
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,492
Oh, come on.

605
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,996
You said you'd support her
as long as you could.

606
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,707
That was ten whole years ago.

607
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,459
Things are different now.

608
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,128
You'll regret how you treated me.

609
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,630
I'll never forget what you did.

610
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,051
Oh, please.

611
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,220
This way, ma'am.

612
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,976
How could he have a secret lover?

613
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,773
I know, right?
I've never heard of him dating anyone.

614
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,442
It seems she's a friend from high school.

615
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,444
She's some nameless actress.

616
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,737
They looked close.

617
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,114
So just give up, Ji-han.

618
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,699
Let Do-han breathe.

619
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,326
I haven't even started.

620
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,203
Whatever it is, don't worry.

621
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,329
I'll fix this.

622
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,372
Ji-han.

623
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,500
I don't want to get married.

624
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,418
I failed once.

625
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,755
Chae-won, you're a really good person.

626
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,174
But Do-han is too.

627
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,719
So trust me. He'll really care for you.

628
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,598
And you?

629
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,017
I already care for you.

630
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,564
Lee Do-han.

631
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,651
I won't let you throw away

632
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,111
such a great blessing.

633
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,404
Action!

634
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,242
Search thoroughly!

635
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,326
Yes, my lord!

636
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,416
Long way to go.

637
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,837
Oh, my gosh!

638
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:33,757
Who are you?

639
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,759
Do you know Na A-jung?

640
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,219
A-jung?

641
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,535
Hey.

642
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,412
I hear he's gay.

643
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,624
Someone saw him
kissing a guy in the art room.

644
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,251
The leader of Class Six?

645
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,544
I can't believe it.

646
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,796
I thought he was hot.

647
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,548
No way.

648
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,758
Well, I think it's actually hot.

649
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,012
-What's wrong with you?
-That's so weird.

650
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,982
You know my dream's to be an actress.

651
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,817
Yes, you're learning acting.

652
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,235
Right.

653
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,863
My acting teacher told me

654
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:43,368
to always be careful because
what I do now can be a touching story

655
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,953
or a scandal.

656
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,623
You should be honored.

657
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,417
This may be my future scandal.

658
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,879
Did you see it?

659
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,383
Don't gossip about stuff
you haven't even seen!

660
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,468
You too!

661
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,226
What's it to you, anyway?

662
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,729
-It's none of your business.
-It is.

663
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,564
He's my boyfriend.

664
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,524
-No way!
-Oh, my gosh.

665
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:15,943
Tell them.

666
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,622
I didn't do that

667
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,958
out of loyalty.

668
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,672
Then why did you help me?

669
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,882
So that you'll be thankful.

670
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,010
And because of that,
you'll write a nice post

671
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,513
about me when I get famous.

672
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,642
Tell everyone I was an awesome friend.

673
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,145
Anyway, that's why I did it.

674
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,022
So just

675
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,899
thank me.

676
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,276
Thanks.

677
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,820
Did you see their faces?

678
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,780
I fooled everyone.

679
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,449
I'm so good at acting.

680
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,952
I might do well in action too.

681
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,333
Okay, you're great at it.

682
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,376
I admit.

683
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,980
NA A-JUNG

684
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,150
-Hey.
-What's going on?

685
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,402
Why is your brother here?

686
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,783
Why am I your girlfriend?

687
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,495
Wasn't that over
when we graduated from high school?

688
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,873
Sorry, there was a misunderstanding.

689
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,250
I didn't think he'd go and find you.

690
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,253
Make up some excuse and send him away.

691
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,172
I'll tell you everything later.

692
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,882
-Sorry.
-Okay, fine.

693
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,354
I'm looking for Lee Do-han's girlfriend.

694
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,066
Is your boyfriend Lee Do-han?

695
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,776
Not Kim or Park Do-han?

696
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,736
Yes, it's Lee Do-han.

697
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,868
Is the coffee bad?

698
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,495
No, it's fine.

699
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:35,749
Right. I'm sure you're not frowning
because of the coffee.

700
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,918
Is it because of me?

701
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,880
I'm sorry. I've never
seen his girlfriend before.

702
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,340
It's fine.

703
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,592
I've never seen his brother either.

704
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,303
She keeps retorting.

705
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,889
So, Do-han's brother,

706
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,225
why are you here?

707
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,478
What did you have to say to me
so desperately?

708
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,110
Do you love him?

709
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,241
Oh, I'm so sorry.

710
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,244
I'm so sorry.

711
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,746
What do I do?

712
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,039
Sorry about that.

713
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,833
I only read lines

714
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,043
like that on scripts.

715
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,462
I didn't expect to hear that in person.

716
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,547
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,091
Do-han...

718
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,426
Yes, I love him.

719
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,345
That's why we're dating.

720
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,180
I like him a lot.

721
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,890
Let me be frank.

722
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,477
Can't you spit him out

723
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,604
like you spat out your coffee?

724
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,358
I don't usually spit out coffee.

725
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,570
I was just flustered, that's all.

726
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,029
I'll fluster you again.

727
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,490
He has...

728
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,160
someone to marry.

729
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,372
Cool.

730
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,041
Is it an arranged marriage?

731
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,753
Do-han, you punk...

732
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,297
This is fun.

733
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:14,014
Wait. But he really
shouldn't be doing that, though.

734
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,641
You're the one he shouldn't be dating.

735
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:21,646
You shouldn't be here either.
Isn't this what mothers-in-law do?

736
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,273
Does that even matter?

737
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,609
As long as the message is clear.

738
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,905
Anyway, what you're saying is,

739
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,493
Do-han doesn't want to get married,
but your family wants him to.

740
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,289
That sounds serious.

741
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,209
I was going to break up
in return for the coffee.

742
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,752
What?

743
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,547
Are you saying my brother's
just worth a coffee?

744
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,424
Okay.

745
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,385
If that's the case, then I won't break up.

746
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,012
-What?
-I won't break up.

747
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:02,687
And...

748
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,107
Haven't you watched drama shows?

749
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:10,278
In a situation like this,
you should bring some money

750
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,280
to reach an agreement at least.

751
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,782
You came unprepared.

752
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,580
Money?

753
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,344
Ms. Na.

754
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,725
If you break up with Do-han,
I can give you money as consolation.

755
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,312
I never said I'd accept it,

756
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,774
but if you insist,
can you give me two billion?

757
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,858
Two billion won?

758
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,237
You're just testing me, right?

759
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,571
You tested me.

760
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,241
You came to see me in person

761
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,577
because you wanted to see
if I seemed okay.

762
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:01,454
Isn't that right?

763
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,584
I'm really offended by this, you know.

764
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,254
All right, then.

765
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,551
But I'll let it slide just this once

766
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,013
because you're my best friend's brother.

767
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,723
And this is a gift.

768
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,391
Go home now.

769
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,068
Sorry.

770
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,405
She's that woman from before?

771
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,452
I really didn't want to go this far.

772
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,412
Excuse me.

773
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,832
Help me!

774
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:48,626
What's going on?

775
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,170
He's my stalker.

776
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,672
He keeps following me, saying he's a fan.

777
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:53,757
-Help me.
-"Fan"?

778
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,133
I never said that.

779
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,719
Hey, outsiders can't come in here.

780
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,512
-Please leave.
-It's not that.

781
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:00,805
-I--
-Just go.

782
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,349
Or I'll call the guards.

783
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,018
Let's go.

784
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,145
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

785
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,313
Sorry about that.

786
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,946
A-jung, just once. Please.

787
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,282
Why do I have to do it again?

788
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,742
What about the double?

789
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,787
Na-ri says your movements
are similar to hers.

790
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,664
It's not like I'm getting paid more.

791
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:30,627
I let you off once, so help me.
This will be the last time.

792
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,170
-Please get ready.
-Fine.

793
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,506
Let's start shooting!

794
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,676
-A-jung.
-Yes?

795
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,262
Who's that guy? He keeps staring at you.

796
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:43,807
I don't know.

797
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,767
Don't mind him.

798
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,810
What?

799
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,561
We'll begin shooting.

800
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,073
Good. Great.

801
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,539
But her face...

802
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,623
Not good?

803
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,418
One more time!

804
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,088
Watch your posture
and don't turn too much.

805
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:16,548
Okay!

806
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,677
I've never heard
of a faceless actress before.

807
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:26,975
Okay.

808
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,895
You ducked too much.

809
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,897
Na-ri will have to do the same.

810
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,483
Who's Na-ri?

811
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,277
The horse?

812
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,113
Cut! Darn it, this is taking too long!

813
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,615
We have to finish the shoot today!

814
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:44,659
Sorry!

815
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,327
-Sorry.
-You can do it!

816
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,790
All right, focus.

817
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,389
Are you okay?

818
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:08,641
Are you okay?

819
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:09,726
Hey, call 911.

820
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,186
-Hurry.
-Are you okay?

821
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,234
A-jung...

822
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,069
Will she be okay?

823
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,533
Yes, a court lady role.

824
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,701
-Right away.
-Hey.

825
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,412
You're firing her?

826
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:30,497
Hang on.

827
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:35,126
She's hurt and can't play the role.
We can't postpone the shoot.

828
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,171
That's unfair. She got hurt
because of the shoot.

829
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,131
Should we wait for her, then?

830
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:44,010
Will you pay for the rent here?
No, right? Let's get ready.

831
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,303
Yes, call me back.

832
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,582
Thank you.

833
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,841
Has she woken up?

834
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:25,802
Not yet.

835
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:28,638
Too bad.

836
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,598
I have to get going,

837
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,851
so I should call someone to come.

838
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:37,689
Let's go.

839
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,409
You don't have anyone to call?

840
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,870
Do-han is your boyfriend.
Can't you call him?

841
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,455
Hey, don't tell Do-han

842
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,666
about what happened today.

843
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:02,213
You know, everyone has sides of their life
they don't others to know.

844
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,174
This is what it is for me.

845
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,094
Putting up with unfair things.

846
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,346
Anyway, don't tell him.

847
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,516
Then why did you show me?

848
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,603
You have nothing to do with me.

849
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,274
Right, I hope you keep that thought.

850
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,735
Don't ever get involved with me.

851
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,368
I...

852
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,412
Just this once.

853
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,332
Give me a ride back there.

854
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,208
Why go back there?

855
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,420
I have to take a shuttle there to Seoul.

856
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,673
I can barely make it.

857
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,898
Okay, let's go.

858
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,735
Should I go to that cafe?

859
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,030
Aren't you going to Seoul anyway?

860
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,990
Just give me a ride to Seoul.

861
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,283
And the shuttle?

862
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,745
You wouldn't have let me in
if I asked anyway.

863
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:16,871
I'm pretty smart.

864
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,333
Let's go.

865
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,094
That cheap jerk.

866
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,639
He actually dropped me off
at the filming site.

867
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,734
This looks tasty.

868
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,487
Do-han.

869
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,826
Can I have chopsticks, please?

870
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,911
-Thank you.
-Sure.

871
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,663
How did you find me?

872
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,790
It's obvious, you're always

873
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,334
at home or your workshop,

874
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,962
and you come here to eat.

875
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,588
Right?

876
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:10,591
What happened to your arm and face?

877
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,470
Your brother must've kept quiet.

878
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,513
What?

879
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:17,765
I fell at work.

880
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,853
We promised to eat noodles later.

881
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,229
This is the time.

882
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,402
What?

883
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:40,997
Move!

884
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,000
My back...

885
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:46,753
Damn it...

886
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:49,797
My...

887
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:52,800
Who sent you?

888
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,720
Who sent you?

889
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,180
Choi Min-woong from LJ Hotel.

890
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:59,807
Were you in New York too?

891
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,436
I don't even have a passport.
I was only hired last week.

892
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,358
He paid you well, right?

893
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,819
So I'll take this instead.

894
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,240
If you follow me one more time,
I won't let it slide.

895
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,589
Hey.

896
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,177
I tried not to ask since it's private,

897
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,056
but what on earth does your family do?

898
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,974
Hang on.

899
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,021
If I hear this,
will I get involved in some crime?

900
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,732
Or will I be in danger?

901
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:52,026
You watched too many TV shows.

902
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,028
That's all I've learned from.

903
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,158
It'll be faster

904
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:02,119
to just see them yourself.

905
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,166
I'll introduce you.

906
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,049
Damn it, he found out!

907
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:19,136
He even took his memory chip.

908
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:22,348
He could really take over.

909
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,642
I don't know about Ji-han,

910
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,727
but Do-han didn't seem to care.

911
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,063
We can't let it happen.

912
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,525
Your half-brothers don't know anything
about management.

913
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,695
First, we have to stop his marriage
with Chae-won.

914
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:40,449
We can't win
if Taeyang Group is on their side.

915
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,660
The shareholders will support them.

916
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:48,082
But wouldn't it be difficult
since Grandfather wants the marriage?

917
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,669
One flaw of a perfect person
always stands out

918
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:53,629
more than others.

919
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,132
HEAD OF TEAM, EUN TAEK

920
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:01,220
We have to get rid of that holdout
before Grandpa's birthday party

921
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,305
at all cost.

922
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:03,973
The holdout?

923
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,558
In Do-han's heart.

924
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,811
That woman, Na A-jung or something.

925
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:10,605
Oh, Ms. Na A-jung.

926
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,274
I looked into her a bit,

927
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,027
but are you sure they're dating?

928
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:20,031
Even if it's long-distance,
you'd see each other once a year.

929
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,950
But they haven't met
for the past five years.

930
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:23,993
Take a look.

931
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:27,872
What is this?

932
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,171
She's played in numerous roles
for the last five years.

933
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,672
Dead bodies,

934
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,927
and even a zombie
in that famous zombie movie.

935
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:42,678
But a minor role.

936
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,058
She seems to take any role she can.

937
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,560
She played a high school student too

938
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,438
and even has a regular role.

939
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,065
In a reenactment show,

940
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,233
she got married so many times.

941
00:53:56,317 --> 00:54:00,029
That's not all.
She was in all sorts of TV shows,

942
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,907
historical, fantasy, you name it.

943
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,786
So you mean, she would've had
no time to date at all.

944
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,330
That's a relief.

945
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,499
This is scary

946
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,167
and terrifying,

947
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,796
but at least she's not
really his girlfriend.

948
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:21,801
But if it was a lie,
why would he have lied about it?

949
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,135
Who knows?

950
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:32,687
Yes?

951
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:37,566
You can't find one of the papers
in the shopping mall contract?

952
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:40,444
What? Tell them to look carefully.

953
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,614
Please keep looking.

954
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,119
They looked everywhere.

955
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:49,954
Why would it be gone?

956
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,540
I took really good care of it...

957
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,671
There's some kind of
TV show script in there?

958
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,881
Can you

959
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:02,925
get the number

960
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,387
of Do-han's fake girlfriend?

961
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,561
The stuff you left behind.

962
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:20,443
Thanks.

963
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:24,780
When I went back that day,
the set was all locked up.

964
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,575
Thanks.

965
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,826
That was crazy.

966
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,870
It's all Na-ri's fault.

967
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:33,748
A-jung...

968
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,042
Don't be too upset.

969
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,126
Right.

970
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,253
Accidents happen at filming sets.

971
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,006
You get fired often, too.
It's no big deal.

972
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,090
I know.

973
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,176
It's common to get hurt

974
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,386
and get fired.

975
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,097
But why is it always me?

976
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,724
A-jung.

977
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,145
All I want is to make a living
by doing what I love, acting.

978
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,106
Is that too much to ask for?

979
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,484
Why is that so hard?

980
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,527
A-jung.

981
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,530
I just lost that tiny role.

982
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:11,243
But I felt pathetic when I found
myself looking for another job.

983
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,289
Damn it...

984
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,171
Hey, why are you guys crying?

985
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,889
-This is so...
-I'm really fine.

986
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,599
This sucks.

987
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:58,833
Hello?

988
00:56:58,916 --> 00:56:59,917
It's Lee Ji-han.

989
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,419
You have my contract, right?

990
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:03,712
Lee Ji-han?

991
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,715
Oh, Do-han's brother?

992
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,385
Was this yours?

993
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,220
Why did you put it in my bag?

994
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,472
You're the one who stole it.

995
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,432
Whatever. Give me your address.

996
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,644
We'll meet later anyway. I'll bring it.

997
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,729
What? Why would I see you?

998
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,273
I'll send someone.

999
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,859
Oh, Do-han didn't tell you?

1000
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,654
I was invited to dinner with your family.

1001
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,030
Dinner?

1002
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,783
You mean LJ Hotel?

1003
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,034
Why?

1004
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,745
I told you, I was invited.

1005
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,748
Anyway, I'll give it to you at dinner.

1006
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:40,833
Bye.

1007
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,963
Hello?

1008
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,507
Did she just hang up on me?

1009
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,053
Are you here?

1010
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,307
No, I'll come and get you.

1011
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,475
Okay.

1012
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,188
Over here.

1013
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:04,648
Chae-won, why...

1014
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:06,442
I invited her.

1015
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,485
Come and sit.

1016
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:14,283
It'll be nice to let them
see you two together on a day like this.

1017
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:15,826
Goodness.

1018
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,247
I told you I'd announce you
as my successor here.

1019
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,457
What...

1020
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,250
Weren't you taking that back?

1021
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,128
You told me to just come and eat.

1022
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,589
Well, otherwise you wouldn't have come.

1023
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,800
I can't make the same mistake again.

1024
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:34,094
Chae-won, stay here with him

1025
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:37,097
and come out together when I call you.

1026
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,308
Keep an eye on him.

1027
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,144
Why are you suddenly doing this

1028
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:45,189
after hiding me for so long?

1029
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:51,278
You treated me as if I'm my mother's flaw.

1030
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,198
Why are you doing this to me now?

1031
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,206
Because you are her flaw.

1032
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,751
A flaw that I can't erase or bury.

1033
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,754
I've decided

1034
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,217
it'd be better to make everyone
acknowledge you

1035
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,471
and be unable to mock you.

1036
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,306
And Ji-han?

1037
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,811
Ji-han and I were both
born out of wedlock. Why just me?

1038
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,315
Ji-han's my flaw.

1039
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,651
That's why.

1040
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:36,490
The guests are waiting.

1041
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,001
Is there a party?

1042
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,254
So many cameras.

1043
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,145
You're actually here?

1044
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,147
Ms. Na A-jung.

1045
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,566
Who are you?

1046
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,609
I'm not some spy.

1047
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,571
I'm Do-han's guest, that's who.

1048
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:16,905
You're not dating him.

1049
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,034
I know you were lying.

1050
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:22,911
Still on about that?

1051
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:27,041
Did you even mean it when you asked me
not to tell Do-han about it?

1052
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,335
Maybe you wanted me to tell him.

1053
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:30,461
What?

1054
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,756
Why are you pretending
to be all successful?

1055
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,341
You worked hard.

1056
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,595
Have you decided to become Do-han's wife

1057
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:42,639
instead of doing such hard work?

1058
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,641
But does he know

1059
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,602
that you got fired?

1060
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,690
Doesn't it seem odd even to you?

1061
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,531
You're fake,

1062
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:01,742
aren't you?

1063
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,162
What's that all about?

1064
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,709
A-jung.

1065
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,213
There must be an event here.

1066
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:15,798
It's so loud.

1067
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:18,759
I can't think.

1068
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,105
Why call her here?

1069
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,441
Why lie about dating her?

1070
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,485
Ji-han!

1071
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,697
I have some things
I want to hide from you.

1072
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:46,203
Do you really have to
dig into them like that?

1073
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,748
Do you always have to get what you want?

1074
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:52,876
What?

1075
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,628
What do you want?

1076
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:59,007
Why are you two good brothers
suddenly fighting?

1077
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:00,551
Get out.

1078
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,386
Hey, don't be so rude.

1079
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,640
Do-han, what are you going to do?
You got caught.

1080
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,768
You have a girl, don't you?

1081
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:10,811
I said, get out.

1082
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,313
Jeez.

1083
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,158
Where did you get them?

1084
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,662
Did you do this?

1085
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,415
Don't talk to her like that.

1086
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,585
It was sent anonymously, to Grandpa.

1087
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,254
It doesn't matter who was behind it.

1088
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,715
Is this it?

1089
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:44,011
The reason you wanted to give up
Taeyang Group's support?

1090
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:48,849
Do-han.

1091
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:50,851
What would Grandpa say about this?

1092
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,604
-Say something.
-He's not dating her.

1093
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:55,772
I checked myself.

1094
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,318
So stop blackmailing him and get lost.

1095
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:00,694
You little brat--

1096
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,737
You're right.

1097
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,782
I refused to marry Chae-won

1098
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,244
because of her.

1099
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,749
What I realized as time went by

1100
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:15,667
is that you were

1101
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:17,586
the generous ones,

1102
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:20,172
and not me.

1103
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,135
Thank you all so much.

1104
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:45,864
Hey.

1105
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:50,661
Sorry I lied.

1106
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,956
I thought you'd be honest with me.

1107
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,416
I guess that's why I couldn't.

1108
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,837
You used to walk on eggshells
around me all the time,

1109
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,217
trying not to hurt my pride about work.

1110
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,762
I'm not saying I'm innocent,

1111
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,932
but that's why I lied.

1112
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,310
It's an excuse, I guess.

1113
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,314
I'm sorry.

1114
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:24,486
I want to talk to you
about our future leader

1115
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,407
who will walk forward with you
in the future.

1116
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,622
Hey, A-jung.

1117
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,458
How about a new role?

1118
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,752
You can act all you want.

1119
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:43,630
And it's a lead role, not a minor one.

1120
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,093
You're just trying to cheer me up, right?

1121
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,678
I'll pay you anything.

1122
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,556
You talk as if you're rich.

1123
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:56,310
Two billion.

1124
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,854
-Then I'll think about it.
-Sure.

1125
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,939
Two billion won.

1126
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:01,982
And it'll be

1127
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:03,984
for about three years.

1128
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,068
Hang on.

1129
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:06,695
What do you mean?

1130
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:07,779
I need you

1131
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,991
to play that role for me.

1132
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,874
I almost forgot the contract.

1133
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,337
What are they doing together?

1134
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,673
The announcement's soon.

1135
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,136
What is it?

1136
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:35,807
Being my grandfather's
granddaughter-in-law.

1137
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,310
Now, let me introduce

1138
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,647
my grandson, Lee Do-han.

1139
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,220
Hey, are you

1140
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,722
the Lee Do-han

1141
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,266
he just said?

1142
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,309
A-jung.

1143
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,312
Would you like to marry me?

1144
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:25,857
Please, will you

1145
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:27,359
marry me?

1146
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:29,236
No!

1147
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,326
Where am I?

1148
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:20,662
You don't remember yesterday?

1149
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:21,663
I do.

1150
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:25,333
I ran away with some weirdo
from some strange people.

1151
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,962
If I have to get married,
I want to do it with you.

1152
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,088
You're good at acting.

1153
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:32,299
He suddenly wants to marry you? Not date?

1154
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,134
What are you doing here?

1155
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:38,680
From my experience, eating something
in a hurry never ended well.

1156
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,309
Where the hell did she come from?

1157
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,067
