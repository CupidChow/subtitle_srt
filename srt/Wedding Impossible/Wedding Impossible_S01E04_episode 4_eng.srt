1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,960
   
   

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,950
   
   

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,150
   

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,250
   

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,780
     

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,300
   

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,100
   

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,420
   

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,910
   

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:44,020


11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,020
   

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,720
 Chairman Hyeon Dae Ho, who led LJ Group to its current position. 

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,310
 Due to Chairman Hyeon's surprise announcement, 

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,000
 a case is rising to the surface recently online. 

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,920
 The case of the deadly accident of the late President Hyeon Soo Hyeon, 

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,960
 the center of the illegitimate child controversy. 

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
 Despite a witness testimony of a car chasing President Hyeon in the rain 

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
 at the time of the accident on a remote rural road, 

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,810
 the case was wrapped up as an accident by the deceased. 

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,320
 I am accepting the results of the investigation as is. 

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,330
 The short investigation period and the lackluster investigation process 
   

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,430
 left many people wondering. 

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,800
 There were rumors of the late President Hyeon's lover being involved, 

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,070
 or if her husband, Choi Joong Chan, 

25
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,370
 the former mayor of Seoul was chasing his wife in the other car the witness saw. 

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,040
 But these allegations also subsided after he personally denied any marital discord. 

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,470
 But something else came up that was hard to understand. 

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,750
 It was Chairman Hyeon Dae Ho. 

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,050
 Despite various rumors, he kept his silence without disclosing his position on the matter. 

30
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,870
 So, why did he reveal the existence of his third grandson now? 

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,090
 What is the truth behind the accident from that night? 

32
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,770
 If you find this story interesting— 

33
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,830
How many did we watch?

34
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,100
Weren't we only trying to see what they look like?

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,600
You know, marrying a conglomerate isn't just something to celebrate.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,890
What if something happens to our A Jeong after joining their family?

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,080
He covered up the truth even after his daughter died.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,190
All of that is for gaining attention.

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,430
It's just an attention-seeking video with no real conclusion and full of rumors.

40
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,530
The algorithm is fate.

41
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,710
The fact we ended up on that video is perhaps some kind of divine revelation.

42
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,760
Son-in-law Jo! Are you praying for misfortune to come upon A Jeong or what?

43
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,120
Conglomerates are people like us.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,500
People who think no differently from us.

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,630
Also, even if they were to do something that exceeds our imagination,

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,540
what could they do to my sis?

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,110
I'm asking you this just in case.

48
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,380
Do you like me, Lee Ji Han?

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,630
- No. 
 - Then why would you say that?

50
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,670
As if you're confessing your love.

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,290
It is a confession.

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,220
To be exact, it's a confession of conscience.

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,480
I don't like you, but I'll try stealing you away, Na A Jeong.

54
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,800
- Why? 
 - Because if you end up liking me,

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,690
you won't be able to marry my brother.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,270
Keep feeling dumbfounded, get flustered, and get excited.

57
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,240
It's my turn to make you feel that way.

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,520
Once you organize your feelings, you'll be in love with me already.

59
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,520
I made up my mind.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,760
I'll seduce you real good

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,380
and kick you to the curb.

62
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,570
I said, I'll allow it.

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,450
Why are you so surprised?

64
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,290
You told me you wouldn't allow it last time.

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,650
I never said I wouldn't allow it.

66
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,980
I asked you what you would do if I didn't allow it.

67
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,110
Hey, if Grandfather approves, just say, "Thank you, we'll live happily ever after."

68
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,480
Why talk so much?

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,220
I guess he was shocked because he gave his approval so readily.

70
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,210
Congratulations. I am happy for you. Seriously.

71
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,640
Congratulations.

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,850
Congratulations!

73
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,340
All right.

74
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,600
Pack all your stuff in New York and move back before your wedding.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,360
Come on, man...

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Hurry up and say you'll pack up everything and move back—

77
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,980
But, Grandfather, why does he have to pack up over there?

78
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,390
What do you mean why?

79
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,010
He should learn the business as soon as possible.

80
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,880
My thoughts haven't changed.

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,850
Regardless of the marriage,

82
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,650
I will entrust the management of the company to Do Han.

83
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,010
Lee Ji Han,

84
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,870
did you feel flustered, dumbfounded, and excited because of me?

85
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,240
- Pardon? 
 - That's what you just said.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,460
You said it's your turn to make me feel that way.

87
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,110
Then, doesn't that mean I did that to you before?

88
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,600
Don't just hear what you want to hear.

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,280
Why leave out what I said before that? I said you annoy me.

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,750
It's true I feel dumbfounded and flustered by you,

91
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,860
but that doesn't mean I get excited by you.

92
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,540
You don't have to pretend to be relaxed because of your pride.

93
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,870
It would be weirder not to get excited when I confess to you

94
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,250
with this face, this voice, and these eyes.

95
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,640
Well, I'm not pretending.

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,340
I really don't feel excited.

97
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,060
Maybe you're frozen stiff from being nervous inside. Just wait a bit.

98
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,740
You'll start feeling it soon.

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,090
I'm not feeling it at all.

100
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,620
I see. Maybe it's because it's night and chilly.

101
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,810
No, it's not anything like this, either.

102
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,590
See? You felt it, right?

103
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,720
- Don't deny it. 
 - What's with you?

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you, really?

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,940
Do you know why I came here today?

106
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,140
I came to get his approval to marry Do Han.

107
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,110
And you're in your right mind?

108
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,250
Is that the right attitude to get approval?

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,360
Complaining about food, talking back, and slapping Brother's butt in front of Grandfather?

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,840
Forget it.

111
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,770
I don't want to argue with you.

112
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,210
Come inside.

113
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,300
You could never become a good person for my brother.

114
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,730
Even if others may not know it, I do.

115
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,640
Worry about yourself.

116
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,930
From what I can see, you're definitely not a good younger brother to Do Han, either.

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,420
Also, you say you'll seduce me?

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,010
Don't be so sure. I don't know if I'd fall for someone as shameless and underhanded as you.

119
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,300
But if you're that confident, give it a shot.

120
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm also curious if I'd find you attractive and fall for you.

121
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,830
You're too much, Grandfather.

122
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,170
He's not your only grandson.

123
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,260
I'm also part of your bloodline and my mother's son!

124
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm the eldest grandson of this family!

125
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,620
While he lived doing whatever he wanted,

126
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,610
I'm the one who stayed by your side and tried to do something to lead the company!

127
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,970
- Honey! 
 - Let go!

128
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,120
Did I say anything wrong?

129
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,290
All right. Everyone, leave. I'm tired, too.

130
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,420
To be blunt, aren't they the illegitimate ones?

131
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,980
What?

132
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,240
Mother ended up like that because of those guys—

133
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,380
Oh, my! Honey...

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,070
How dare you...

135
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Min Woong, let's get this straight.

136
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,850
I'm the one who led this company and cleaned up after your messes all this time.

137
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm tired. Hurry up and leave.

138
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,570
Grandfather...

139
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,940
Honey, are you okay? Let me see.

140
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,520
Gosh, seriously. Honey!

141
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,970
Gosh, seriously...

142
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,880
 Honey. 

143
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,660
This is for Lee Do Han.

144
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,050
Since my brother got slapped, this is only fair.

145
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,670
Ji Han,

146
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,400
let's be fair.

147
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,040
You even stole our mom. It would be too shameless if you took the company, too.

148
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,940
Don't you think so?

149
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,470
You should know your place and have a sense of shame.

150
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,560
The reason I am...

151
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,480
just letting you go about at your whim

152
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,900
is because you are no match for me.

153
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
But...

154
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,110
since you're being greedy without being grateful,

155
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,070
my brother got slapped

156
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,750
and you got slapped, too.

157
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,380
That's what happened. Isn't that right?

158
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,090
Let go of me.

159
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,010
I said, let go.

160
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,600
Grandfather...

161
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,880
gave his approval...

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,010
for our marriage.

163
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:23,390
   

164
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,780
 Hello. 

165
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,130
I heard he fired seven directors who were part of the Chairman's line

166
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,150
and hired new directors from his side.

167
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,110
Why do you think? He thinks his children won't get to inherit the company,

168
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,970
so he's increasing the number of people on his side to oppose the Chairman.

169
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,380
If he slowly takes over the majority like that,

170
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,510
the Chairman can't do anything even if he thinks differently.

171
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,790
Hey, he's coming.

172
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,140
Trash.

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,530
- Pardon? 
 - Clean it up.

174
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,600
It's at your feet.

175
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
Trash?

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,760
Gosh, he scared me.

177
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,570
If he saw it, he should clean it up.

178
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,250
He has the second most shares in the company after the Chairman.

179
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,570
Why is he telling Ji Han to clean up the trash?

180
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,600
How are you taking care of business?

181
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,030
Why is that Lee Ji Han still at the company?

182
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,860
He needs to be there to know

183
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,940
what a high position he is coveting.

184
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,590
Father, you're sure I don't have to worry about this, right?

185
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,980
It's not like I'm handing over a subsidiary company.

186
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,200
Do you think it's that easy to hand over the management rights?

187
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,430
This is so annoying!

188
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,930
Of course, I won't sit idly by while the shareholders let that senile old man do what he wants.

189
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,880
But Grandfather does whatever he wants!

190
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,020
He even slapped my face like this!

191
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,590
If you just sit still, everything will be given to you.

192
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,630
So, don't cause any trouble until then.

193
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,130
That's right.

194
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,440
Think about how you've survived until now.

195
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,210
- What are you saying? 
 - Why do you think I got my license suspended for DUI?

196
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,060
You caused that drunk driving accident while you were on probation.

197
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,760
But I took all the blame for you.

198
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,900
Hey, Choi Seung Ah, watch your mouth.

199
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,170
If it wasn't for that, I would be the next in line, not Lee Do Han!

200
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,360
- I got passed over because of you. You know? 
 - Hey!

201
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,970
- What! 
 - Seriously, you—

202
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,970
Stop it!

203
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,540
Seung Ah, don't think about anything else and help your brother.

204
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,210
Look at Lee Ji Han.

205
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,230
See how hard he is trying to get LJ into his brother's hands.

206
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,300
You heard that?

207
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,510
Take Father's words to heart.

208
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,840
Why do you have so much ambition as a girl?

209
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,820
In any case, it's good the old man approved that marriage.

210
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,640
If it was Yoon Chae Won of Taeyang, the shareholders would have felt differently today.

211
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,850
What do you think?

212
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,870
Am I being too selfish?

213
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,460
No. You are not.

214
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,800
It's just...

215
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,770
It's just what?

216
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,380
I'm just worried you may be fighting a difficult battle when Do Han doesn't seem to want it.

217
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,060
Well, if you're thinking about who would lead the company best,

218
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,020
don't you think Ji Han is a good candidate?

219
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,500
What? Underhanded?

220
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,110
 I don't know if I'd fall for someone as shameless and underhanded as you. 

221
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,800
 It's true I feel dumbfounded and flustered by you, 

222
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,400
 but that doesn't mean I get excited by you. 

223
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,390
It's because of the results of the temporary shareholders' meeting, right?

224
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:34,430
You always clean like this when you have things weighing on your mind.

225
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,780
Yes, among other things.

226
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,050
Honestly, I also was a bit worried this time.

227
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,440
I thought the shareholders would definitely get noisy

228
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,030
if the Chairman retired and Hyungnim rose to that position right away.

229
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,980
There's no need to worry.

230
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,200
Brother just needs a supporter, too.

231
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,640
Then, nobody will be able to say anything.

232
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,360
Do you still believe Hyungnim needs CEO Yoon Chae Won?

233
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,060
Yes.

234
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,840
And I need your help, Eun Taek.

235
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,720
I mean, what is an angel— I mean, a person who should be at the cafe...

236
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,590
doing here?

237
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,610
That's what I should say.

238
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,440
Why are you here, Cold Iced Americano?

239
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,490
 A Jeong isn't here. 

240
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,050
 She's not in this drama anymore. 

241
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,400
- That's cheating. 
 - Hey!

242
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,100
Gosh, seriously! Come on!

243
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,980
Gosh, stop, stop, stop!

244
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,670
Gosh, damn it.

245
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,520
Honey! Honey, are you all right?

246
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,930
You sure you don't need to go to a hospital? Let's see.

247
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,080
Why did you say you would go up against that bull!

248
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,930
Honey, I'm all right.

249
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,690
Also, I'm a man.

250
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,610
- A Jeong is a woman... 
 - Oh, my gosh!

251
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,460
Gosh, seriously.

252
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,080
Hey! Use words!

253
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,660
You always come here and hit people whenever something's bothering you.

254
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,770
Hey. Don't talk about hitting people in front of me for the time being.

255
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,730
That's why I'm here feeling uneasy about it all day.

256
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,440
What are you saying? You've been beating up my husband.

257
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,000
What? What is it now?

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,520
You said you even got the marriage approval.

259
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,650
Isn't that a good thing?

260
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,240
Yeah.

261
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,150
Hey, but why do you think he approved so easily?

262
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,460
But didn't you go there to get his approval?

263
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,310
You talk as if you went to get his disapproval.

264
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,760
I did go to get his approval.

265
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,370
But I'm just wondering why he approved us so readily.

266
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,970
Why would you say that?

267
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,400
What?

268
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,510
She must be crazy...

269
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,600
Honey...

270
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,340
So, this woman really slapped that younger brother right in front of you?

271
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,300
Yeah, she did.

272
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,270
He's the one who got slapped, but it totally woke me up.

273
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,390
She looks mean.

274
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,550
It felt like that entire family could be explained in that one scene.

275
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,450
But I feel bad for that youngest brother.

276
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,520
I mean, it's sad enough his parents died,

277
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,490
but his half-siblings constantly pick on him,

278
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,840
and his brother won't listen to him.

279
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,030
Honestly, I feel like he must be very lonely.

280
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,620
Tae Min, I feel uneasy enough. Could you not add any more to that?

281
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,930
What's up with you?

282
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,400
If you feel that uneasy, why don't you be nice to him?

283
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,250
Yeah! Why don't you sweet-talk  (seduce)  him and get him on your side?

284
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,900
 I made up my mind. 

285
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,100
 I'll seduce you real good and kick you to the curb. 

286
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,760
You're not allowed to say that to me, either.

287
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,730
Just sew up my mouth. Why don't you?

288
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,740
She says whatever she wants to, yet she always tells me I'm not allowed.

289
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,230
He's a total psychic.

290
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,290
How did he know I was talking about him?

291
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,190
Hello?

292
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,700
 Where are you right now? 

293
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,180
Why do you need to know that?

294
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,450
 You're not ill, right? 

295
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,680
 An illness where you can't just simply answer me. 

296
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,280
I'm not ill, and I am very healthy.

297
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,570
I was working out near my house and just got out.

298
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,300
 Near your house? 

299
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,220
 Okay. 

300
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,190
He's the one who's sick. He can't help but hang up the phone suddenly.

301
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,810
Hey, Sis. Let's go eat chicken feet.

302
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,040
After hearing the spicy story of the conglomerate in-laws, I'm craving some spicy chicken feet.

303
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,360
Let's go.

304
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,380
Get in.

305
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,500
Who are you?

306
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,790
I guess you like the coffee?

307
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,820
Looks like you'll drink the cup itself at this rate.

308
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,680
No. I just drank it since it was here.

309
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,810
In any case, what's all this?

310
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,410
What's with your outfit, and what's with this car?

311
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,750
It seemed like you forgot. So I wanted to remind you.

312
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,270
I am a third-generation chaebol.

313
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,510
I already know that.

314
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,360
No. I don't think so.

315
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
The male leads in the dramas you were in.

316
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,850
Young and rich, tall and handsome.

317
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,010
The real-life version of that perfect description is me.

318
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,370
That's why you said weird stuff about not being excited by me.

319
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,290
So, you're doing all this to seduce me?

320
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,790
Enjoy it. People say there's no guy like the ones in the dramas

321
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,970
but you were lucky enough to meet me.

322
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,780
I don't know stuff like that.

323
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,720
I always got extra roles that never got anywhere close to the male leads.

324
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,190
Then all the better.

325
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,010
That means I'm the first male lead in your life.

326
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,350
Stop talking nonsense.

327
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,430
Where are we going anyway?

328
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,210
If you're taking me to a construction site again,

329
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,980
stop the car so I can get off.

330
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,810
What else would we do when I came to pick you up dressed up like this?

331
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,410
We are going on a date.

332
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,580
- Says who? 
 - You said to give it a shot.

333
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,230
You said you were also curious.

334
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,020
When you're curious, trying it out is the best way.

335
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,920
All right. Go for it then.

336
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,580
I guess you could only give up after giving it a shot.

337
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,200
   

338
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,480
You often hear that you're pretty shrewd, right?

339
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,390
Looking at how you dream, you seem that way.

340
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,820
But why are we going to Busan?

341
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,570
- To watch a movie. 
 - Why go all the way to Busan to watch a movie?

342
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,550
By chance, are we going to the Busan International Film Festival?

343
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,460
Are we watching a film?

344
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,590
Please get changed before the plane takes off.

345
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,080
It's a pretty outfit.

346
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,890
In any case,

347
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,370
is it because these are good seats?

348
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,420
This is the first time I've been on an empty plane.

349
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,850
It's because I booked the entire plane.

350
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,350
I see. Of course, you did.

351
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,790
But what movie are we watching when we get there?

352
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,220
Did you know you're quite classy?

353
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,450
But too bad. I don't get easily excited from watching a movie with a guy.

354
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,050
 Passengers, we're experiencing some turbulence. 

355
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,810
 Please check if you've put on your seat belt. 

356
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,090
This doesn't mean I got excited. It means I got startled.

357
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,270
I'm glad someone was inside today.

358
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,180
It could've started a fire if it wasn't found right away.

359
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,210
The thing is that short circuits are invisible.

360
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,180
You only find out after a problem arises.

361
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,800
I was overseas, so I left this place vacant for a long time.

362
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,080
I didn't know it was short-circuited because I hadn't paid attention.

363
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,380
Really?

364
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,300
I mean, the wire sheath was cut off as if someone did that on purpose.

365
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,150
Are you sure someone doesn't have a grudge against you?

366
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,790
I'm just joking!

367
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,790
- All right. Take care. 
 - Yes, thank you.

368
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,480
Sure.

369
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,650

 Yes, Ahjumma.

386

I can't believe I got to see this movie before it was released.

But how did you know I like Director Kwon Hee Joo's work?

390
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,390
Did you do a background check on me?

391

♫  Though it won't be easy for you to hold back  ♫

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,500

Let's go.

399
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,030
I said, let's go!

400
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,700
- Son! 
 - Director.

401
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,890
Have you been well?

402
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,130
Of course.

403
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,540
But what's up?

404
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,770
I can't believe you want to see my movie.

405
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,410
But who is this?

406
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,170
- I am... 
 - Say hello.

407
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,640
She is my mother's friend, Director Kwon Hee Joo.

408
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,360
Hello.

409
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,300
Yes, hello.

410
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
And this is Na A Jeong.

411
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,070
She's my favorite actress.

412
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,990
Oh, my. You were an actress?

413
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,970
- Yes. 
 - I'm sorry.

414
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,030
- I should've recognized you first. 
 - Oh, no.

415
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,000
I only did a lot of small roles.

416
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,850
I really enjoyed your movie.

417
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,870
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

418
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,590
Director.

419
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,360
Hey.

420
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,200
- Let's meet again next time. 
 - Okay.

421
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,440
- I'll recognize you first, then, A Jeong. 
 - Okay.

422
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,190
- I'll be going. 
 - Goodbye.

423
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,840
Director Kwon Hee Joo!

424
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,160
You said you won't easily get excited from watching a movie with a guy.

425
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,280
I think you're super excited right now.

426
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,790
But how do you know her?

427
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,480
She's your mother's friend?

428
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,730
I really love Director Kwon Hee Joo!

429
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,460
How could it be? Seriously.

430
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,870
Hi, it's been a while!

431
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,120
Gosh, I'm not going to work with that director again.

432
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,890
- Don't do it. 
 - Seriously, she's so—

433
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,250
Na A Jeong?

434
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,010
Why would she be here?

435
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,170
I haven't felt this way in so long.

436
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,310
I guess you don't like me.

437
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,650
You came out on a blind date, but you already ate,

438
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,240
and you keep answering me with short replies.

439
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,000
A meeting like this is uncomfortable for both of us.

440
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,960
I think I'm the only one trying too hard.

441
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

442
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,420
But I came here not knowing it was this kind of meeting.

443
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,670
I have to get to an important meeting. I'll see you next time—

444
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,000
You're a liar.

445
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,280
Is there more important business than your marriage?

446
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,750
We're in the same boat.

447
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,820
My mother said you have nothing on your schedule.

448
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,840
And I'm sure your father told you I have nothing on my schedule.

449
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,950
I didn't hear that.

450
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,970
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
I know you heard!

452
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,380
 So cool! 

453
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,090
 So handsome! 

454
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,780
 Gosh, congratulations! 

455
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,570
 I'm so envious! 

456
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,290
 I'm against this marriage. 

457
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,110
 So choose. 

458
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,570
 Is it me or this marriage? 

459
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,110
 Ji Han, what are you doing? Get up. Your clothes will get dirty. 

460
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,290
 What do you mean? I came here to throw a tantrum. 

461
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,260
 If you must walk down the aisle, step over me. 

462
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,230
 I guess I can't get married today, then. 

463
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,770
 How could I step over you? 

464
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,670
 CEO Yoon, your family is too nice. 

465
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,490
 I met your father outside, and he was smiling. 

466
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,030
 How could he be smiling? 

467
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,660
 He's sending off such a pretty daughter today. 

468
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,050
 Yoon Chae Won, are you really going to marry him? 

469
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,030
 You won't regret it? 

470
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,860
 - Yeah. 
 - Even though I'm begging you like this? 

471
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,480
 Forget it, then. 

472
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,280
 I'll just take a picture and go. 

473
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,820
 - Please take a picture of us. 
 - Okay. 

474
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,170
 Since you're marrying another man and not Lee Do Han, 

475
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,360
 I can't wish you happily ever after. 

476
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,090
 Eat well and be unhappy, CEO Yoon. 

477
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,790
 Is that something you should say to someone who's getting married? 

478
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,020
 Yeah? Then I take that back. 

479
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,440
 It's such a shame. 

480
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,180
 Had I known, I would've tried hitting on you, too. 

481
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,410
 I take that back, too. 

482
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,100
I guess I've finally gone mad.

483
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,330
Seeing how I miss those days.

484
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,230
Please enjoy.

485
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,670
It was a nice try, but you didn't excite me.

486
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,810
I got excited because of Director Kwon.

487
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,420
Let's get that straight.

488
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,620
You never got my heart racing.

489
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,900
You got excited because I let you meet Director Kwon. Shouldn't I get credit for that?

490
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,280
If you keep acting like a highway robber, I'll just go back to Seoul.

491
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,000
So, is your face okay?

492
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,500
Are you pitying me right now?

493
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,890
No. Well, there's no need to say it like that...

494
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,190
Then, continue to pity me.

495
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,310
There is a saying that pity is the shortcut to love.

496
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,700
Take the shortcut so you can fall for me quickly.

497
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,840
We saw a movie and filled our stomachs. Do we go back to Seoul now?

498
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,850
No. Since we got full on desserts, let's go eat the entree.

499
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,300
Wait here for a moment. I'll be right back.

500
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,160
Gosh, why did I come here?

501
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,160
A Jeong!

502
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,850
Oh, Na Ri.

503
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,990
You came to see the movie, right?

504
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,610
I thought I saw you earlier at the VIP waiting room.

505
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,050
Oh, really?

506
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,100
If you saw me, you should have said hello.

507
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,550
Did you see my movie? How was it?

508
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,280
Gosh, seriously.

509
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,580
I felt like the role didn't suit me, so I refused it three times.

510
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,190
But Director Kwon insisted on working with me. That's why I did it.

511
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,900
I thought it was fun.

512
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,410
Your acting was good, and the story was also good.

513
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,310
And the director's direction was good, too.

514
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,350
Oh, that's good.

515
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,590
But, Unni,

516
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:09,350
where did you buy these clothes?

517
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,780
These? I got them as a gift.

518
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,400
Why?

519
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,200
That person must be crazy.

520
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,820
Who bought you that outfit?

521
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:24,030
How could they gift you a copy of the one and only outfit that was imported? It's so obvious.

522
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,730
Unni, just throw away these clothes.

523
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,290
I'll lend you my clothes. Let's go to the party for movie stars with me later.

524
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,060
A party?

525
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:35,520
Didn't you say not just anyone could go in without an invitation since it's a VIP party?

526
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,170
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

527
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,180
"Not just anyone"?

528
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,010
"Not just anyone"?

529
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,810
A Jeong is an actress, too!

530
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,810
Hey, just because she wasn't invited to the film festival,

531
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,370
isn't in leading roles and is an obscure actress,

532
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,200
are you saying she can't get into the party?

533
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,470
Hurry up and apologize to Unni.

534
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,640
- No, it's okay. 
 - I'm sorry.

535
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,230
No, it's all right.

536
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,800
Na Ri, come on. I don't even want to go. Why are you taking it out on her?

537
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,130
She's looking down on you, Unni.

538
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,670
You know, right?

539
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,190
I really hate ranking people.

540
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,730
Bow your head more.

541
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,790
Na Ri? Na Ri...

542
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,910
What? I'm already annoyed.

543
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,090
There was a mistake with the reservation.

544
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,560
The rooms were changed.

545
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,320
Don't you know I only stay at this suite when I come to Busan?

546
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,660
Get a different room even after coming all the way here?

547
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,140
They sent out our reservation change e-mail due to a visit from a VVIP.

548
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,070
Gosh, I'm so sorry. I should have checked it in advance.

549
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,750
So, who is the VVIP?

550
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,720
Is it an actor? Does he rank higher than me?

551
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,940
What psycho changed the reservations and took someone else's room?

552
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,720
I'm that psycho.

553
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,070
Let's go.

554
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,070
You!

555
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,590
One more thing.

556
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,400
 I would like you to look into someone. 

557
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,040
 Who else besides Na A Jeong? 

558
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,300
 Hello, it's Na Ri, Na Ri, Hong Na Ri! 

559
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,420
 They are college classmates, and Na A Jeong was much more popular back then. 

560
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,610
 But Hong Na Ri hit it big after graduating. 

561
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,900
 - Are these the new line? 
 - Perhaps due to her inferiority complex, 

562
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,100
 she cast Na A Jeong as an extra in her dramas and mistreated her. 

563
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,840
 Is it this one— 

564
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,740
 I'll buy this. 

565
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,540
 There is an actress I'm a fan of, and I want to gift it to her. 

566
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,940
 Oh, but there is only one import of this product. 

567
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,880
 It's okay. 

568
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,480
 I'll let him have it. 

569
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,580
 Please come this way. 

570
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,000
   

571
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,460
&lt;- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

572
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,840
 Gift? 

573
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,260
 I think you forgot. 

574
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,470
 Give it to me. I'll accept it. 

575
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,160
 I never said I was giving it to you. 

576
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,650
 It's Hong Na Ri. 

577
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,360
 Yeah, it's definitely her. 

578
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,640
 What happened? 

579
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,840
 The business class is all empty. 

580
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,460
 There weren't any empty seats when I was making the reservations. 

581
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,420
 Are you saying someone bought all the seats and chose not to get on? 

582
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,010
 Hello, all of our Gaenari! Guess where this is! 

583
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,280
 Shall we head inside together? Go, go. Go, go, go! 

584
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,000
 I'm sorry. We've rented out the whole space today, 

585
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,030
 so it will be difficult for you to use our store today. 

586
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,760
 By chance, do you not know me? 

587
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,050
 G-Goodbye. 

588
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,150
 I don't think you should be saying goodbye. 

589
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,580
 I don't think you should be leaving like that. 

590
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,870
 What the... 

591
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,310
 Wait a second... 

592
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,170
 This bastard... 

593
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,390
This outfit...

594
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,110
Dessert!

595
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,100
This is so annoying.

596
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:35,930
I'm going to post what you did as a power trip all over my social media.

597
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,680
By chance, do you know how many followers I have?

598
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,060
Post it. I'll post all of your power trips, too.

599
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,470
You made the extra ride a horse

600
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,320
which led to an accident, but you ignored what happened and had her fired.

601
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,650
What does that have to do with you?

602
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,820
It does have to do with me.

603
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,690
Today, Na A Jeong is...

604
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,040
my lead character.

605
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,970
Let's go.

606
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,210
Did you just clap?

607
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,840
So annoying.

608
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,110
You're annoying, too.

609
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,430
Take a seat.

610
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,900
I had it prepared in advance. I'm sure you'll find at least one thing you like.

611
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,170
- What is all this? 
 - What do you think?

612
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,650
I am shamelessly and underhandedly trying to seduce you in my own way.

613
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,180
How do you feel? Don't you feel so much better?

614
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,010
Whenever Hong Na Ri comes to Busan, she will be reminded of this day.

615
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,160
How her day was utterly ruined while remembering your face.

616
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,160
So, why did you do that?

617
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,320
How did you know my relationship with Hong Na Ri?

618
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,220
Did you do a background check on me or something?

619
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,650
Yes, I did.

620
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,050
I can't confess my love to someone I don't care about,

621
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,950
and I wouldn't try to date them, either.

622
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,850
So, I took revenge on your behalf.

623
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,470
All the male leads in your dramas acted like this.

624
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,810
They appeared at a crucial moment

625
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,760
and fixed everything in such a refreshing manner.

626
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,040
In any case, whichever room Hong Na Ri stays in this hotel,

627
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,250
she's beneath our feet.

628
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,390
This room is on the highest floor.

629
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,470
I'm not trying to brag, but this is who I am.

630
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,160
What do you think?

631
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,820
Do you feel a bit attracted to me now?

632
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,030
Did you just laugh at me?

633
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,960
I mean, think about it.

634
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,320
What guy gets revenge for a woman so he can win her heart?

635
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,600
Every single one of the male leads in your dramas did that.

636
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,270
Do you know how much I studied them?

637
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,520
If you were going to do that, why don't you just have me go skydiving?

638
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,730
So, my heart would just burst open and not just flutter.

639
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,060
That was the next step.

640
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,110
Stop right there.

641
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,430
If you weren't attracted to me, don't eat it.

642
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,840
The return flight comes in two hours, so—

643
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,170
Why return? That would be a waste of money.

644
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,940
If you booked an expensive room like this, we have to spend the night.

645
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,690
Also, since you're spending money anyway, could you order some alcohol for me?

646
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,340
Then I might be attracted to you.

647
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,410
Yeah.

648
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,900
What? Lee Ji Han is alone with a woman in Busan?

649
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,070
Keep watching him and report everything to me.

650
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,270
Even early morning is fine. Report to me right away.

651
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,410
- See if he stays the night. 
 - See if he stays the night.

652
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,290
See how serious their relationship seems.

653
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,800
See how serious their relationship seems.

654
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,670
Yeah, that's right!

655
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,580
Check all the CCTV footage and send them to me.

656
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,280
Honey, we've got a really big one coming.

657
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,090
He tried to put Taeyang's daughter together with Do Han.

658
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,090
His own woman must be amazing.

659
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,220
You're right.

660
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,380
Tell him to find out who that woman is quickly.

661
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,100
Okay.

662
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,800
Reporter Kang Ik Joon you mentioned last time.

663
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,990
I met him, and he said he has nothing to tell you, Director.

664
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,990
He said he would only talk to Chairman Hyeon, whatever it may be.

665
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,930
Now, a guy like him is brushing me off.

666
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,070
How dare he discriminate when all he does is write tabloids?

667
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,220
Forget it.

668
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,790
Find some leads for him to write articles.

669
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,360
Then, ask for another appointment.

670
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,790
This time, I'll personally come.

671
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,570
Lee Ji Han.

672
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,480
You really won't drink a single glass?

673
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,630
Not with you, Na A Jeong.

674
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,300
I was going to reconsider if you drank this with me.

675
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,780
About being attracted to you.

676
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,140
Just kidding.

677
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,050
Gosh, seriously.

678
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,060
I thought this today, here and there.

679
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,400
I haven't gotten even one step closer to my dream.

680
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,200
But the funny thing is...

681
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,220
I feel like I really tried my best.

682
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,460
I really, really worked hard,

683
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,440
sacrificing my time and my pride

684
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,590
to endure and endure again.

685
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,350
But all I did was endure and never made any headway.

686
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,680
What did I work hard for?

687
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,610
If I just give it all up completely,

688
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:17,640
do you think this nagging, lingering feeling will disappear, too?

689
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,040
Without lingering feelings, you could probably be happy.

690
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,800
Probably, right?

691
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,350
But probably not grow. Don't you think?

692
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,690
The greatest emotion that helps a person grow is disappointment.

693
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,720
Disappointment makes you strive for the next time.

694
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,340
Don't give it up completely.

695
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,260
That lingering feeling.

696
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,750
Someday, that will motivate you to action.

697
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:58,290
♫  So we don't get hurt anymore  ♫

698
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:05,130
♫  The place where the well-rounded you and I will meet  ♫

699
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,290
Oh? You said you wouldn't drink with me.

700
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,800
And honestly, I didn't really like the movie we watched today.

701
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,680
Especially when Hong Na Ri eats kimbap from a trashcan after starving for three days.

702
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,230
Your acting from that Fascinating Reenactment Theater was so much better.

703
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,070
The reenactment theater?

704
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,790
By chance, the one where I got stuck in the mountains in a disaster and ate a can of tuna?

705
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:31,960
Yes. Also, when you secretly ate the king's leftover food in a historical drama.

706
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,910
That was...

707
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,010
way better than Hong Na Ri's acting.

708
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,820
Lee Ji Han, did you seriously watch all of that?

709
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,070
Were you listening at all?

710
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:45,160
I told you I watched all of your dramas to study the male leads.

711
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,190
Can you see it? My capillaries swelled up from watching too much.

712
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:53,430
♫  I'll carefully share it all  ♫

713
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,110
♫  So we don't get hurt anymore  ♫

714
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,650
You are the first person

715
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:07,500
who watched all of my dramas besides my parents.

716
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,640
Well, there's no need to be too moved by it.

717
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,650
♫  Perhaps like this, you  ♫

718
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:25,260
♫  With a face that says you're in love with me  ♫

719
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,650
♫  You keep telling me you love me  ♫

720
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,360
♫  How could you be like that?  ♫

721
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:39,450
♫  I'll store all of your love in my heart  ♫

722
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,960
Lee Ji Han, the hairdryer in my room is broken. Where's the one you use—

723
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,950
What's this? He didn't come home last night?

724
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,620
Gosh, my head...

725
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,950
It would be a shame to get a scar on this face.

726
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,370
Still appreciating my face?

727
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,550
Then, look a little longer.

728
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,040
I'll give you more time.

729
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,900
It's late. Wake up.

730
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,910
Didn't you say our flight is at 12 p.m.?

731
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,000
 Passengers, we will be taking off shortly. 

732
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,030
 Please check if you are wearing your seat belt. 

733
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:19,530
 Ji Han, don't worry. It's all right. 

734
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,330
 Oh, no... 

735
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,240
 Ji Han, are you all right? 

736
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,890
The plane took off.

737
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,710
It's okay now.

738
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,280
This is all your fault, Ji Han.

739
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,350
It looks like my love...

740
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,440
is about to be ruined.

741
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,310
I'm treated like a two-timing playboy.

742
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,220
If that's all it took to ruin your love,

743
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,490
it's not even worth starting.

744
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,530
If it was that easy, would it be love?

745
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,660
My feet just keep moving toward her without realizing it,

746
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,080
I keep looking at her,

747
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,660
and she's got all of my attention.

748
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,880
Liking someone is like that.

749
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,150
Isn't that more like a robot controlled by a scientist rather than liking someone?

750
00:49:54,610 --> 00:50:00,780
Once you really start liking someone, you'll understand all that.

751
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,490
We know why I'm like this.

752
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,160
But why do you look so bad?

753
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,220
That's not true. I'm absolutely fine.

754
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,030
That's not true. You're absolutely not fine.

755
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,380
I can clearly see your mind is elsewhere.

756
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,730
You're having a hard time trying to sway Na A Jeong's heart, right?

757
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,200
I told you.

758
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,330
It's not an easy task to win over someone's heart.

759
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,370
How about you have someone else do it for you?

760
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,770
- Someone else? 
 - As long as someone can steal Na A Jeong's heart,

761
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:41,180
it doesn't matter even if it's not you, no?

762
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,450
Though you two have a testy relationship,

763
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:49,090
Na A Jeong may respond more favorably to someone else from the start.

764
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:53,170
Then, things may be resolved much more easily.

765
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,880
I don't know if you know this, but LJ is the first to use our exhibit hall.

766
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,140
I'll check everything carefully so you won't regret it.

767
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,810
- Okay. 
 - Then I'll be going.

768
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,790
Did you eat?

769
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,320
Look at the time. Of course, I ate.

770
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,570
But what's this?

771
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,570
A list of blind date candidates that Dad selected.

772
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:39,440
- Will you go? 
 - If you tell me not to, I won't.

773
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,400
Then don't. It's not over until it's really over.

774
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,810
Ji Han, I have something to tell you.

775
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,280
Yeah, tell me. I'm listening.

776
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,000
This is not the right place for it.

777
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,300
I want to tell you properly at a nice place.

778
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,610
Do you have time on Friday?

779
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,100
Okay then.

780
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,900
You said you won't go on these dates, right? Then I'll take them.

781
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,920
Even though he gave his approval, it'd be good to submit the marriage registration form first.

782
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,990
I filled out my part. You just have to fill in your part.

783
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,940
Also...

784
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,650
this is our ticket.

785
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,970
- New York? 
 - Yeah.

786
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,120
This soon?

787
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,320
Grandfather is going on a business trip to India then.

788
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,970
We need to take off when he's not around.

789
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,210
I mean, I'm fine with leaving

790
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,890
since I was planning on leaving with you from the start.

791
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,920
But even if we leave, we should do what we need to do.

792
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,730
I heard a lot about you for a long time.

793
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,690
But I just heard of you as a close friend of hers.

794
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,840
I didn't know you were from such a prestigious family.

795
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,810
But since when did you guys get into a relationship?

796
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,120
- Three years ago— 
 - About five years ago—

797
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:05,000
What does it matter when they started dating?

798
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:11,700
- Right? 
 - Oh, that's true.

799
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,350
All that matters is you two got together and are getting married, right?

800
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,210
I'm lacking in many ways,

801
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:21,750
but thank you for trusting me and allowing me to marry her.

802
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,450
Oh, don't say that.

803
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,900
A Jeong is even more lacking.

804
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,700
We are just grateful you would take in our A Jeong.

805
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,600
- Goodness. 
 - A Jeong is the one who's taking me in.

806
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,240
I really can't do without A Jeong.

807
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,050
Oh, my, how could you speak as splendidly as you look?

808
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,850
By the way, do you have any siblings?

809
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,550
Oh, I have one younger brother.

810
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:58,070
If he's anything like his brother, he must also be handsome and have a pleasant personality. Right?

811
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,000
- Please have some. 
 - Oh, okay.

812
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,430
Yeah.

813
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:17,240
This is better than wasting my time trying to make her fall for me.

814
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,130
   

815
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:25,410
Gosh, your future conglomerate husband is quite decisive.

816
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,050
He wants to register your marriage as soon as you get approval from your families?

817
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,380
Did you go to Busan with Lee Do Han, too?

818
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,590
Do you know how much Hong Na Ri flipped out on the set?

819
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:39,180
That she got screwed over by Na Ah Jeong's lover, who was throwing money around.

820
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,420
 Were you listening at all? 

821
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,620
 I told you I watched all of your dramas to study the male leads. 

822
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,440
 Can you see it? My capillaries swelled up from watching too much. 

823
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,150
 Come to TK Hotel's restaurant by 6:30 p.m. 

824
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,080
 I have something to tell you. Make sure to be on time. 

825
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,010
How could he text me as soon as I thought of him?

826
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,380
He must be a psychic at this rate.

827
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,540
- Who is it? 
 - Who is it?

828
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,100
He should call me if he's got something to say.

829
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,390
Why is he always asking to meet in person to say it?

830
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,860
Who?

831
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,100
Shouldn't the person with something to say be the one to come?

832
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,950
Why is he telling me to come and go?

833
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,380
Am I just someone who comes when he says to come

834
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,990
and not go when he says not to come?

835
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,030
Am I like that?

836
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,540
Who are you talking about?

837
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,320
There's this bothersome person. In any case, if I see him today

838
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,410
and he starts talking nonsense, I won't let him get away with it.

839
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,870
Who are you saying you won't let it slide?

840
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,350
There must be someone you're referring to.

841
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:38,900
That's what we're curious about. Who are you saying you won't let things slide?

842
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,640
In any case, I'm leaving now.

843
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,280
- Suddenly? 
 - Leaving? What?

844
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,310
- Hey, where are you going? 
 - Where are you going?

845
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:48,060
Where are you going in the middle of filling out your marriage registration form?

846
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,980
Thank you.

847
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,110
Ms. Na A Jeong?

848
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,850
Hello. I am Han Young Hoon, your blind date.

849
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,070
What are you thinking about so intently?

850
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,650
It's nothing.

851
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,360
But what do you want to tell me that you're dragging this out?

852
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,270
Just tell me.

853
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,240
After we eat first.

854
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,620
You said you didn't bring your car, right? Do you want to have a drink?

855
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,800
I drank too much not too long ago, so I'll pass.

856
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,730
- You can drink if you want to. 
 - I'll pass, too.

857
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,130
I want to tell you while I'm clear-headed.

858
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,850
What is this?

859
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,200
What is it that you're acting like this?

860
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,210
I'm a bit scared seeing you be so serious.

861
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,060
Hey, Chae Won!

862
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,110
Wow, I can't believe I'm running into you here.

863
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:54,400
- Did you come here to eat? 
 - Yeah.

864
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,940
- Oh, Ji Han is here, too. 
 - Hello.

865
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,570
What's going on, you two?

866
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,590
Did you send a substitute to your blind date to go on a date with him?

867
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,850
What are you talking about? My blind date?

868
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,110
I sent someone else in your place.

869
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,210
I heard the eldest son of Moonho Construction has a great personality.

870
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,160
Gosh, what are you talking about?

871
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,830
He also pulled out after hearing Chae Won wasn't coming.

872
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,620
I don't know who he sent among his friends,

873
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,770
but if it's his close friend, you had better call quickly.

874
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:21,110
You all know Han Young Hoon is no good, right?

875
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,290
- Oppa. 
 - Yeah.

876
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,360
Anyway, enjoy your dinner.

877
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,420
I'll see you later.

878
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:34,500
Who went on the blind date in my place?

879
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,000
What?

880
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,770
No, it's nothing.

881
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,190
CEO Yoon, I think I need to go.

882
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,960
I'm really sorry. Let's talk later.

883
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,760
I'm really sorry.

884
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,380
Ji Han!

885
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,970
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

886
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,690
Seriously...

887
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,450
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

888
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,000
 So, is your face okay? 

889
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,690
 You are the first person 

890
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,570
 who watched all of my dramas besides my parents. 

891
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,280
 The plane took off. 

892
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,320
 It's okay now. 

893
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,430
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

894
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,560
I'm sorry.

895
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,190
I'm sorry.

896
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:29,200
   

897
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,580
   

898
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,880
 The call is not going through. 

899
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,660
Well, I have to get going now.

900
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,890
As I told you earlier,

901
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,490
I didn't know I was coming to this kind of meeting.

902
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:05,460
What kind of meeting did you think this was?

903
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,580
A date with Lee Ji Han?

904
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,450
Why is that important?

905
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,800
I'm curious.

906
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,760
Who are you that...

907
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,130
Lee Ji Han would care so much to send you on such a date.

908
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,540
I also find that...

909
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,890
quite interesting and curious.

910
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,600
I thought we'd gotten a bit close now.

911
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,750
Even among my friends, Lee Ji Han is well-known for being very upright.

912
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,840
He doesn't ever drink outside in case he causes trouble,

913
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,570
and he never comes out to golf with us.

914
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,680
He says when more than two guys meet up, it always leads to trouble.

915
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,020
A woman who is close to Lee Ji Han, who is so thorough in managing his private life.

916
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,430
You're the first one after Yoon Chae Won.

917
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,400
That's why I wanted to learn more about you.

918
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
Why? Can't I?

919
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,500
No.

920
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,100
Cheers.

921
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,690
Are you in your right mind?

922
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,900
Why would you come here?

923
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:19,350
Well, so, shall we go now?

924
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,070
Yes, sounds good.

925
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:25,090
I had plans anyway, so I need to get going.

926
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,430
What plans?

927
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:31,090
I was saying we should go upstairs to a room.

928
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:34,590
- Pardon? 
 - I said I wanted to learn more about you.

929
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,430
Show me how you seduced Lee Ji Han.

930
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,710
I'm as good as Lee Ji Han at—

931
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,780
What are you doing right now?

932
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,580
I was always curious whenever I watched dramas.

933
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,770
Why would people spray expensive drinks in someone's face?

934
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,060
I see this was why.

935
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,080
Lower your voice and sit down.

936
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,510
Don't order me around.

937
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,510
Are you my boss or my parents?

938
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,140
How dare you tell me what to do?

939
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,600
If you leave now, who knows what rumors I'd spread about you and Lee Ji Han.

940
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:17,310
Should I spread rumors saying Lee Ji Han is sponsoring an obscure actress?

941
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,600
I don't think I'd be the only one curious about that.

942
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,200
That's right. How dare he set me up with a woman like her.

943
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,880
Have me end up with someone like his mom?

944
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,760
Drink. If you don't want to see that bastard,

945
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,950
barely holding on to that family, be ruined by weird rumors.

946
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:45,710
Yeah, you should drink all the alcohol here. That's good manners.

947
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:48,850
I can't bear to listen to your desperate plea.

948
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:53,770
Fine. Since you're clinging to me like a moron, I'll just drink this for you.

949
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,780
- Moron? 
 - I sat down,

950
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,660
and I'll show you the good manners you mentioned.

951
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,500
So stop with your nonsense.

952
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,000
- Nonsense? 
 - If I drink this,

953
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,030
you'd better shut your trap about Lee Ji Han. You got that?

954
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,300
All the alcohol is gone. She can leave now, right?

955
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,480
Na A Jeong, why can't I reach you?

956
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,400
The district office closed, so I came back to the studio.

957
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,800
Give me a call when you get this message.

958
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,820
It's fine if nothing happened, but I'm worried something might have happened.

959
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,700
 Your message has been recorded. 

960
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,260
   

961
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,550
Yes, Secretary Kim. I want to ask you for a favor.

962
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:29,810
Could you get me the CCTV footage from the past few days near my studio?

963
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,100
Yes, including the maintenance crew, too.

964
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,800
Lee Do Han.

965
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,400
I had my doubts, but it really is you.

966
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,470
Have you been well?

967
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:00,500
Don't follow me. I'm really pissed.

968
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,310
My bag. Give it to me.

969
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,170
Don't be mad. I was wrong.

970
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,590
About what?

971
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,890
Do you even know what you did wrong?

972
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,290
The one I was trying to set you up with wasn't like that guy.

973
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,790
He was much better...

974
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:25,770
Whether that guy or a better guy came to the date isn't important right now.

975
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,920
You heard all of that, right?

976
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,250
Why didn't you do anything if you heard all of that?

977
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:35,170
You say all kinds of infuriating things to me without a problem.

978
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:39,600
Why didn't you say anything when that guy was talking bullshit?

979
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,020
Did you eat honey or something?

980
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,420
- I don't eat sweet stuff. 
 - See?

981
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,650
You see?

982
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,760
You talk back to me just fine.

983
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,900
Why didn't you say anything back there?

984
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:54,140
By chance...

985
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,060
are you getting mad in my place?

986
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,890
Not because you're angry about me sending you on that date?

987
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:04,260
You know, I don't care what strangers say about me.

988
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,460
It's not like I'm ever going to see him again.

989
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,440
I was treated to good food and expensive drinks.

990
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,950
I didn't lose out.

991
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,720
But that's not the case for you, Lee Ji Han.

992
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,050
Why do you keep getting hurt in front of me?

993
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,610
Getting slapped and what that moron said, too.

994
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,970
You really make me feel uneasy.

995
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,570
I don't make your heart race...

996
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,410
but make you feel uneasy?

997
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,610
You want to talk about my heart racing even in this situation?

998
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,910
I got pissed, too.

999
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,500
Because you were insulted, Na A Jeong.

1000
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,790
What a surprise.

1001
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:47,840
To think you would get pissed off, for my sake.

1002
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,800
Didn't you hate me the most, Lee Ji Han?

1003
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,000
I guess it means I like you, then.

1004
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:07,480
I think I like you enough to get pissed off if someone insulted you.

1005
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You, Na A Jeong.

1006
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:20,940


1007
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,700
Lee Ji Han?

1008
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,410
Lee Ji Han.

1009
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:49,230
♫  Without realizing, I end up smiling along with you  ♫

1010
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:57,400
♫  The way you speak and every little move you make, all of it  ♫

1011
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,540
Lee Ji Han.

1012
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,910
♫  If you feel the same way I do, could you say so?  ♫

1013
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:08,630
♫  I want to know everything about you  ♫

1014
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:12,920
♫  You entered my heart without me realizing  ♫

1015
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,950
♫  And hotter than the sunlight in midday  ♫

1016
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,690
♫  You filled me with warmth  ♫

1017
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:25,320
♫  Even when I close my eyes, I can see you clearly  ♫

1018
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,290
♫  I can't describe it all with words  ♫

1019
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:32,000
   

1020
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,980
 Let go! 

1021
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:36,500
 I should have known. I wondered why he drank the alcohol in my place. 

1022
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,190
 This is clearly kidnapping. 

1023
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:42,380
 I thought you'd be like this. So I recorded it all. 

1024
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,220
 I said hand it over! 

1025
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,590
 If I can't reach you like yesterday, that's a breach of contract— 

1026
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:52,000
 I want you to investigate the woman my younger brother is dating. 

1027
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,500
 I'll leave with A Jeong. 

1028
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,050
 Can't you just watch us? 

1029
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,200
 I'll be really good to Do Han. 

1030
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,500
 My heart is beating for you regardless of my will. 

1031
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,100
♫  I wonder what would make your heart race  ♫
