1
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:02,688
That day, it was the end of the world for
some, but a new world began for others.

2
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:03,981
I can't accept this.

3
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,401
My wife just appeared
after years as a corpse,

4
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,279
and now you want me to adopt the children

5
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,323
she had with another man?

6
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:21,874
How about you being so quick
to transfer Su-hyeon's assets to yourself?

7
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:26,253
How about you
having not divorced her for years?

8
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,507
Ji-han, go sit over there.

9
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,850
You have no place here.

10
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,645
Among the hostile looks,

11
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,022
-I realized something.
-Look.

12
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,149
Listen carefully...

13
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,447
I'm Lee Ji-han.

14
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,992
Are you my grandfather from today?

15
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,796
That if there's no place for me here,
I should just make one myself.

16
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,964
LEE JI-HAN, AGE 8

17
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,884
YEAR 2007 GRADUATION CEREMONY

18
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:24,770
I'm sorry I'm not who you were expecting.

19
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,233
Don't say that, Mr. Kim.

20
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,443
I was waiting for you.

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,779
For me?

22
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,789
"A triple salary raise coupon,

23
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,124
promotion coupon,

24
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,418
forgiving-a-mistake coupon."

25
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,752
What is...

26
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,463
I've graduated from elementary school now.

27
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,924
I know what's going on at home.

28
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:58,095
Put in a good word
for me and Do-han with Grandpa.

29
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:03,309
If we succeed later on,
I'll let you use those coupons.

30
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,437
If there's no one on my side,
I'll make them be.

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,521
LEE JI-HAN, AGE 14

32
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,445
Ji-han.

33
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,616
Let's stop now, please?
We pulled three all-nighters.

34
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,700
Only three?

35
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,869
My exam's soon.

36
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,621
Okay.

37
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,582
Go and wash your face,

38
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,335
then explain this question to me.

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,170
I don't get this.

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,546
Even without hope...

41
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,506
LEE JI-HAN, AGE 18

42
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,468
Whenever I see you

43
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,347
Three, two, one
Be mine, LJ

44
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,059
I love you, LJ

45
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,687
They were hired
through blind screening this year.

46
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,775
I'll always protect you

47
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,611
-Blind screening?
-Be mine, LJ

48
00:03:55,694 --> 00:04:00,658
I'll take care of you until the end

49
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:05,079
Be mine, LJ
You know me

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,793
Even without faith,

51
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,005
if I worked harder,
I thought I could have it all.

52
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,967
And after all those years of effort,

53
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,803
when I just had one step left...

54
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,264
Just one single step left...

55
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,726
Where the hell did she come from?

56
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,354
A-jung.

57
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,523
Would you like to marry me?

58
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,150
And why didn't I know this?

59
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,360
No,

60
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,654
what angers me the most right now...

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,074
Please, will you marry me?

62
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,409
No!

63
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,412
Why now?

64
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,330
Why?

65
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,335
Why did she suddenly appear now,
at this crucial time?

66
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,179
CHAIRMAN HYUN'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
LJ FOR A BRIGHT FUTURE

67
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,699
He called Do-han.

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,869
He's just standing there alone.

69
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,913
Someone has to help him.

70
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:44,970
Hello.

71
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,431
I'm Yoon Chae-won from Taeyang Products.

72
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,683
Well...

73
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,436
What is she doing up there?

74
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,147
Is Grandpa announcing it?

75
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,235
What are you doing? Send someone
to cut the power or something.

76
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,612
I can't.

77
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,239
I sent them to find something.

78
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:08,911
The woman

79
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,372
Do-han's dating is here, right now.

80
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,751
-What?
-She's here now.

81
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,754
Before Mr. Hyun makes a big announcement,

82
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,714
I would like you

83
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,592
to spare some time for me.

84
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,860
Do-han.

85
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,737
What's going on?

86
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,325
I have to know what's going on
to play along.

87
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,454
Go and stay in my car.

88
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,539
Okay.

89
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,834
-You had a car?
-I'll explain.

90
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,918
Just wait for me.

91
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,002
Hurry.

92
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:14,184
He should've told me
where he parked his car at least.

93
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,312
There's a range to this key.

94
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,733
He's gotten a bit weird.

95
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,360
Excuse me.

96
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,947
Were you with Mr. Lee Do-han earlier?

97
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,031
Who are you?

98
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,616
Please come with us.

99
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,910
Mr. Choi Min-woong wants to see you.

100
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,704
Who's he?

101
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,873
Tell him to come himself.

102
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,332
-Why...
-You can get

103
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,710
-an explanation later.
-What are you doing?

104
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,088
I'm not talking to strangers.

105
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,050
What? I can scream pretty loudly.

106
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,844
You shouldn't do this here.

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,352
Give me the key.

108
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,771
Give it to me! Or want to follow them?

109
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,329
EPISODE 2

110
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,694
My head hurts so much.

111
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,405
So it wasn't a dream.

112
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:03,961
Do-han?

113
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,259
Oh, my God!

114
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:17,099
You're the one who invaded my space,
so why are you startled?

115
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,141
Where am I?

116
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,810
You don't remember yesterday?

117
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,894
I do.

118
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:26,108
I ran away with some weirdo
from some strange people.

119
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,944
You popped up
looking like some shabby ninja.

120
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,072
Because I couldn't be seen with you.

121
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:37,244
Just out of curiosity,
are you not going to thank me at all?

122
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,080
I get to ask questions first.

123
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,790
Where am I?

124
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,377
I guess Do-han's never
even invited you here?

125
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,047
This is

126
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,175
really Do-han's house?

127
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,637
Why would he live here?

128
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,265
You hurt your head hard.

129
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,975
Right, my head...

130
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,311
What happened to my head?

131
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,605
I wanted to ask that.
What's wrong with you?

132
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,984
You jumped out of a moving car yesterday.

133
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:16,950
Give me my contract.

134
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,078
What's happening today?

135
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,332
Everyone's ordering me around all day.

136
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,126
Give it. You said you'd bring it.

137
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,340
Happy?

138
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,926
Drop me off at the street over there.

139
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,011
One more thing.

140
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,056
Promise me you'll ignore what Do-han said.

141
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,265
What do you mean?

142
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,600
That thing

143
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,518
Do-han asked you.

144
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,563
Oh, marriage?

145
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,817
To be honest,
I can't believe he said that.

146
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,944
I'll talk it over with him.

147
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,530
Talking doesn't seem to work with him.

148
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,449
I'll be the judge of that.

149
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,120
Promise you won't do it.

150
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,581
Approaching school zone.

151
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,209
Observe the speed limit.

152
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,462
Let me tell you this.

153
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:16,259
I learned Hapkido and Taekwondo and
attended action school for three years.

154
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,886
Threatening to hit me?

155
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:22,432
No. I mean that if I was less pretty,
you'd have seen me at the Olympics.

156
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,146
And I know how to jump and fall
safely from a car

157
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,817
if the driver won't let me off.

158
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,070
-You're kidding.
-No.

159
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,406
Is she crazy?

160
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,658
Oh, right. I remember.

161
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,162
But I'm sure I calculated
the speed and angle before I jumped.

162
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,010
Ms. Na. Hey.

163
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,345
Ms. Na!

164
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,139
Is she alive or dead?

165
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,936
I hit my head. Shouldn't you
have taken me to the hospital?

166
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,147
We're not that close, you know.

167
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,232
Don't worry.

168
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,526
They said your head was fine.

169
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,320
By the way, Do-han's brother...

170
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,031
I mean, Mr. Lee.

171
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,535
You asked if I was fake yesterday.

172
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,288
You're right.

173
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,248
I lied to Do-han.

174
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,916
I already know that.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,171
But it seems Do-han lied to me too,
for 15 years.

176
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,797
That's a long time.

177
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,509
Everything I know about Do-han
might be all fake.

178
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,846
That's what I'm worried about most.

179
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,764
So

180
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,477
if you tell me honestly about him,

181
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,520
I'd be grateful.

182
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,066
Is he scamming people?

183
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,235
Yes, Professor.

184
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:02,282
Thank you so much
for coming over late last night.

185
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,451
Yes.

186
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,994
I'll relay the message.

187
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,662
All right.

188
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,542
JEONGAK PHARMACY
FOR: NA A-JUNG

189
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,884
I know he's not that kind of person.

190
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,888
But it's easy
for those who look really kind

191
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,724
to do shady things behind people's backs.

192
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,560
To be honest,

193
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,854
him staying in New York was strange.

194
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,689
He could do art here.

195
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,609
I mean, he loves noodles and chicken feet.

196
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,196
So why does he even stay
where he can't get any of them?

197
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,989
Don't you agree?

198
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,242
But

199
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,828
it makes sense if he's in hiding.

200
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,250
The man who was looking for me
was Choi Min-woong, right?

201
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,044
He had Do-han followed.

202
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,921
But if he was a victim,

203
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,508
it all makes sense.

204
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,134
Then it all fits.

205
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,679
I was mistaken.

206
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,474
Go get changed.
Let's go get your head checked.

207
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,810
No, I'm completely fine.

208
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,440
An arranged marriage?
A successor? Living in a house like this?

209
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,318
It doesn't make sense at all.

210
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,946
It's either

211
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,198
scamming,

212
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,908
or...

213
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,038
Are his parents rich or something?

214
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,415
Our grandpa is.

215
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,334
He is Chairman Hyun Dae-ho.

216
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,589
And Choi Min-woong is my half-brother.

217
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,174
So what you heard yesterday

218
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,137
is Do-han being announced
as LJ's successor.

219
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,056
LJ? LJ Group?

220
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,017
But he wants to throw it away.

221
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,602
Why?

222
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,899
Because of you.

223
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,777
I think I gave you
a kind and honest reply.

224
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,738
So it's your turn.

225
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,907
You really didn't know any of this?

226
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,077
For real?

227
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,224
Stock prices are unstable.

228
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,727
You must be feeling uneasy.

229
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,731
Everyone's talking
about the risks of the change.

230
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,900
And he totally embarrassed you.

231
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,655
Min-woong cried all night
because of what happened.

232
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,158
Scars from your family never really heal.

233
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:55,163
He got calls from reporters
asking about Do-han's parents.

234
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,215
Darn it. I'm a man of pride.

235
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,511
I've been pushed out
by someone who's not even family.

236
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,348
He's not a part of our family, Grandpa.

237
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:18,687
Our family's under fire because of him,
but there's no sight of him.

238
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,314
He should be apologizing,

239
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,607
but where is he?

240
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,861
He's not qualified,
and he's not even interested.

241
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,782
And about yesterday,
if he was in his right mind,

242
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,368
he wouldn't have brought her.

243
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:34,953
Right.

244
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,538
"Her"?

245
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,082
Who do you mean?

246
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,628
Oh, you don't know the real reason
why he refused to marry Chae-won.

247
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,213
No.

248
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,675
He has a long-term girlfriend.

249
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,262
He even brought her
to the party yesterday!

250
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,724
CHAIRMAN HYUN ANNOUNCES SUCCESSOR...

251
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,022
So you're the grandson
of LJ Group's chairman?

252
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,234
And you want to fool him?

253
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,820
By marrying me?

254
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,115
You said you wanted to play
a role like this.

255
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,367
And I'm casting you.

256
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,078
Act as my wife. Just for three years.

257
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,997
Then I'll divorce you.

258
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,373
Are you crazy?

259
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,919
You're the only one I can ask to do this.

260
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,382
At this rate, I'll be forced to marry her,
or they'll find out.

261
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,386
Do-han.

262
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:38,475
I think you're using your courage
for something weird.

263
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,020
A warm family show where you come out

264
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:47,233
and be understood is better
than a soap opera about a fake marriage.

265
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,403
A family show about a gay child
born out of wedlock?

266
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,117
The same thing happened five years ago.

267
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,536
I almost got married.

268
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,913
Not at all.

269
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,252
I was going to reveal everything then.

270
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,423
I couldn't bring myself
to deceive someone like that.

271
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,602
DAE-HYEON

272
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,854
Hello?

273
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,107
What's wrong? Did something happen?

274
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,658
When I saw him,

275
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,743
I came to my senses.

276
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,204
I wasn't worried,

277
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,248
I was scared.

278
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,125
I actually felt relieved

279
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,378
it happened while I was gone.

280
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,506
All I could think of next

281
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,383
was to just flee

282
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,969
from everything.

283
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,640
If I have to get married,
I want to do it with you.

284
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:06,688
I need someone to help me
flee from the company, not succeed it.

285
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,772
Flee? For real?

286
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,899
Are you James Dean?

287
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,235
Like Rebel Without a Cause?

288
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,112
Just accept it.

289
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,281
It's LJ Group of all things.

290
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,910
I can finally understand
why your brother made such a fuss.

291
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,372
A-jung.

292
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,292
I'm not joking.

293
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,793
You're good at acting.

294
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,005
You can keep acting, and I can avoid this.

295
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,508
So you mean

296
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:39,012
you need a Joan of Arc, not a princess.

297
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,556
But you know what?

298
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,143
Princesses get forgiven for anything,

299
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,397
but Joan of Arc was burned to death
even after saving her country.

300
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,732
Get it?

301
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,029
And you think I'd commit fraud
or jump into fire pits if I got cast?

302
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,533
You think I'd do anything for money?

303
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,120
I have work ethics too, you know.

304
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,331
And a family register isn't

305
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,541
some ending credit.

306
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,795
I promise it won't harm you in any way.

307
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,838
What if...

308
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,466
we're caught?

309
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:21,304
What will LJ Group's legal team do to me?

310
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:22,805
Look.

311
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,517
If your grandpa gets angry and sues me,

312
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,979
I could end up
paying them 20 billion instead.

313
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:35,234
Are you not scared of ruining my life?

314
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,363
That's nonsense.

315
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,366
A-jung...

316
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,368
And you think I know you the best?

317
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,788
You've been hiding so many things from me.

318
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,708
For all those 15 years.

319
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,545
You feel like a stranger to me.

320
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,757
I'm leaving.

321
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,732
Things wouldn't have gotten so complicated
if Mr. Choi were the successor.

322
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,613
The chairman's sudden announcement
is causing a lot of trouble for us too.

323
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,242
That's why I believe everyone here

324
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,995
should make the right decision.

325
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,039
You want the new shopping mall in Myeongju

326
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,541
to be stopped again?

327
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,920
The city is pressuring LJ
to sell the land if it'll get postponed.

328
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,171
We can't do that.

329
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,382
It's easier to make

330
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,426
a justifiable reason.

331
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,681
I have another half-brother.

332
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:48,891
What if

333
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,896
that other brother is actually
the one in charge of that project?

334
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,401
Wouldn't it cause more trouble later?

335
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,321
I want it so badly.

336
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,658
Maybe this is

337
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:07,910
a trick.

338
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,163
You know,

339
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,959
in The Honest Woodcutter, he rejects
the axes at first, then gets them all.

340
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,338
Maybe he's after something bigger.

341
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,383
I'm not sure.

342
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,886
The biggest thing he seems to want

343
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,846
is that woman right now.

344
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,347
-Mr. Eun.
-Yes?

345
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:32,060
Can't you see I'm trying to have hope?
What's with all the facts?

346
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:33,728
Sorry, sir.

347
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:34,854
I don't want

348
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,647
to hear

349
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,232
Na A-jung's name.

350
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,029
But neither the chairman nor your brother
are picking up.

351
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,156
What else can you do?

352
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,741
This is so unfair.

353
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,495
A small leak might sink my great ship!

354
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,913
I worked so hard.

355
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,582
Calm down. Breathe.

356
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,877
And sit, please.

357
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,254
Calm down.

358
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,510
Try to be hopeful again.

359
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,512
How can I do that?

360
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,642
If there's a leak,

361
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:17,396
you should get rid of the cause first.

362
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,816
Then it'll be easy to fix the leak.

363
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:21,651
The cause?

364
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,529
Na A-jung?

365
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,078
What is it? Why are you so down?

366
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,788
Why else?

367
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:38,084
The stocks they bought the other day
have plummeted.

368
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,212
You said the prices

369
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,132
were going to soar.

370
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,093
I told you I wouldn't buy them!

371
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,345
That was my severance pay!

372
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,848
But honestly,

373
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:56,227
even the gods couldn't have guessed
such a surprise announcement.

374
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,186
Right.

375
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,398
Dad! Why are you blaming him?

376
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,526
Go take it up with the chairman of LJ.

377
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,070
It was all because of his grandson.

378
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,656
-Jeez.
-Good job!

379
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,825
My eldest daughter is the best!

380
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,536
I don't care about his grandson!

381
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,913
I just care about my stocks!

382
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:19,709
If the stock price doesn't go up,
you're dead!

383
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,294
Stop it already!

384
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,504
Enough with those stocks.

385
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,883
And I thought I had your bankbook...

386
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,513
Honey.

387
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,473
Follow me.

388
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,519
Come on!

389
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,523
Are you okay?

390
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,067
I lost my appetite.

391
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,570
Honey!

392
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,614
Darn it.

393
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,616
This won't do.

394
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,492
Dad will really kill him.

395
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,494
A-jung,

396
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,079
let's put it forward.

397
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,164
What?

398
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,082
Dad's turning 60 next month.

399
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,711
You suggested a hair transplant for him.
Let's do that early.

400
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,880
Did I really say that?

401
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,590
Hey!

402
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,384
You skipped
so many birthday gifts for that.

403
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,554
Don't you dare back out now.

404
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,182
I'm not saying I won't do it.

405
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,268
Dad's looking forward to it.

406
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,687
I found a good hospital,

407
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,940
so send the money.

408
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,859
Honey!

409
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,285
I didn't mean to deceive you,
but I'm sorry I did.

410
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,621
I never meant to hurt you.

411
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,041
And my offer's still valid,

412
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,460
so think about it. I hope you say yes.

413
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,088
-Is it good?
-Yes.

414
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,173
I just got

415
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,841
proposed to.

416
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,178
And by my best friend.

417
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,264
-What?
-Hang on.

418
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:57,848
The guy

419
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,350
who came from New York?

420
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,603
He suddenly wants to marry you? Not date?

421
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:05,022
-He had a crush on you?
-Hey.

422
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,650
There's no such thing as friends

423
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,403
between men and women,
especially after sex.

424
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,239
No wonder.

425
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,448
She was singing,

426
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,910
"let's go to my house"
all the time these days.

427
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,870
Oh, shut up.

428
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,373
You guys are so vulgar.

429
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,874
Okay, fine.

430
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,751
Let's be sophisticated.

431
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,337
Does he even have money saved?

432
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,506
-You don't.
-He's rich.

433
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,300
He has a house, a car,

434
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,010
and even a company.

435
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,513
You actually believe that?

436
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,764
He could scam you.

437
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,018
Hey, I'm serious.

438
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,938
But you said he's a decent guy.

439
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,774
He's the only guy you complimented.

440
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,609
Right.

441
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:53,195
Do-han's a really good friend to me.

442
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,867
I'll never do this again.

443
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,746
People tried to stop me for a reason.

444
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,124
I told you so.

445
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,210
You even dragged me into this.

446
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,629
But the pay was good.

447
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,008
I'm investing this money

448
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,053
in my show. It'll succeed, right?

449
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,429
Of course.

450
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,474
God,

451
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,975
please let my first show

452
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,936
have a huge audience.

453
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,271
Please...

454
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,566
Send lots of guests.

455
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,859
-Please.
-Please.

456
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,902
Amen.

457
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,405
What about you?

458
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,115
Well...

459
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,285
I'm going to invest it in you.

460
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,288
-In me?
-Yes.

461
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,630
Hey, watch your hair.

462
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,467
Don't look so down. You did nothing wrong.

463
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,180
I did.

464
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,934
You invested that hard-earned money,
but my show flopped.

465
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,770
I used my hard-earned money

466
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,064
for something meaningful.

467
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,234
A-jung.

468
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,904
Friends are about giving,
not just receiving.

469
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,364
I have no regrets.

470
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,370
What's with that look? Are you grateful?

471
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,080
Then pay me back later

472
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,165
with your acting.

473
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,961
Still, how could he want
marriage for that?

474
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,256
You get along, and you're single.
What's the problem?

475
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,717
Right. If he's rich,

476
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:42,304
ask him to help
with your dad's hair transplant too.

477
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,391
You're telling me
to sell myself for his hair?

478
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,520
Come on. Your father may have failed
with his children,

479
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,480
but his hair might succeed.

480
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,982
You're so annoying.

481
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,734
I got to go.
I'm late for my part-time job.

482
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,153
You got a job?

483
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,487
Of course, I did.

484
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,532
I have to earn money for my dad's hair.

485
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,700
Bye.

486
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,620
Hey, clean this up.

487
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,415
It's your job to clean up,
and my job to eat.

488
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,499
Jeez.

489
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,475
Exploring the jungle!

490
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,647
You guys, we have to run!

491
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,069
Everyone, you can't tell the hunter
where we are, okay?

492
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,572
-Okay!
-Okay!

493
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,287
Did you see a monkey?

494
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,916
-Over there!
-Over there!

495
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,260
Thank you, everyone!

496
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:06,263
We survived thanks to you.

497
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:10,351
We prepared candies
as a token of our gratitude.

498
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,936
Are you ready for them?

499
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,480
-Yes!
-Yes!

500
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,692
You can't run from me.

501
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,569
I'm going to end this.

502
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,419
You fell from a horse and became a monkey.

503
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,422
Yes, since I need money.

504
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,344
I'm sorry about that day.

505
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,763
I pressed you too much.

506
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,348
Why are you apologizing?

507
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,392
Are you using a different method?

508
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,518
Yes.

509
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,690
A consolation fee.

510
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,569
Not as much as you asked, but it's enough

511
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,613
to make you live comfortably.

512
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,574
I see.

513
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:08,826
But

514
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,786
from my experience,

515
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,998
eating something in a hurry
never ended well.

516
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,335
Food, men, or money for that matter.

517
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,548
Guess you experienced it a lot.

518
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:27,094
I'm old enough to know that I should think
about the consequences.

519
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,181
This is money

520
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,143
that I saved up myself from work.

521
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,770
This is clean money,

522
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,108
so just use it freely for your happiness.

523
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,319
You know by now

524
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,698
that Do-han will find his place
if you're gone.

525
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,369
You two are on opposite sides right now.

526
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,998
He asks me to marry him,
and you ask me not to.

527
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,751
Who should I listen to?

528
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,919
Do the right thing.

529
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,796
The right thing?

530
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,674
What Do-han asks?

531
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,263
No, what I ask.

532
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,360
What would you like?

533
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,572
Two iced Americanos

534
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,366
to go please.

535
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,450
Sure.

536
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,786
You're from LJ, right?

537
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,206
Do you remember me?

538
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,376
You come every day
and always get iced coffee.

539
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,878
Oh, yes. That's me.

540
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,883
My heart's actually really warm,
so I need to cool it down

541
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,802
with a cold drink...

542
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,764
That was a joke.

543
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,099
I see.

544
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,434
What's your number?

545
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,435
What?

546
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,948
Sir,

547
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,909
will you enter it yourself?

548
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,993
Excuse me?

549
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,038
Your number for the stamps.

550
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,748
Oh, right.

551
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,376
My fingernails are short,

552
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,460
so I need this.

553
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,506
It's 010-0613-8593, Eun Taek.

554
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,590
Right.

555
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,218
It's Taek, like the famous character.

556
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,476
Two syllables.
Just like Eunhyuk from Super Junior.

557
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,234
What took you so long?

558
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,074
She's really unpredictable.

559
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:57,161
She's not meeting Do-han that often,

560
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:01,123
but she took the money straight away.

561
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,708
Very strange.

562
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,501
Right?

563
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,212
That was really weird.

564
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,297
You agree?

565
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,049
And the accident happened right then.

566
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,760
Like some insurance scam.

567
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,053
Why did I keep rambling?

568
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,013
What?

569
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,931
You scammed me!

570
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,057
What do we do?

571
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,685
The chairman knows about Na A-jung.

572
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,773
You said Lee Ji-han was so promising.

573
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,444
I dedicated myself to Ji-han's success,
and this is the result?

574
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,528
Total failure?

575
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,908
Taek.

576
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,868
It's not over yet.

577
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,412
The position

578
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,164
is still open,

579
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,708
and you can still win.

580
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,714
When Ji-han graduated
from elementary school,

581
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,175
do you know what I saw in him?

582
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,219
That again?

583
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,596
A tiger with its claws hidden?

584
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,764
What?

585
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:04,686
When he and his brother start competing,

586
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,065
he'll even stab Do-han
to ascend the throne.

587
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,151
Then he should sit there right now.

588
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:15,239
Why's he trying to get Do-han
to sit on the throne?

589
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,824
Because of the accident.

590
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,703
The one that killed Hyun Su-hyeon.

591
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,035
He thinks he caused his parents' death.

592
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,496
He can't take that throne.

593
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,715
This is a rough sketch.

594
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,385
The amount changes
depending on the design.

595
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,638
Lowering the hairline like this

596
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,726
would cost more,
but it'll have more volume.

597
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,855
I like this shape, but my daughters

598
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,691
are paying...

599
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,986
-I see.
-Jeez, Dad. Don't worry.

600
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,196
Just pick the design you want.

601
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,161
Go on.

602
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,038
Give him lots of hair.

603
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,373
-All right.
-Make it thick.

604
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,792
Lots of hair.

605
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,295
We'll harvest them through an incision,

606
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:57,466
and it'll be 6.3 million won in cash.

607
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,761
We're paying in advance.
Is there no discount?

608
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,388
-Sorry, there isn't.
-All right.

609
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,141
This is money

610
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,561
that I saved up myself from work.

611
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:12,648
Hey.

612
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,732
-What?
-What's up?

613
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,944
Nothing. I'm sending it.

614
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,449
This is clean money.

615
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,243
Right. He said it was clean.

616
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,328
I should use it.

617
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,332
So just use it freely for your happiness.

618
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,547
I'm sorry.

619
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,384
We'll be back next time.

620
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,927
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry.

621
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,804
-Hey.
-Dad.

622
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,724
I'll get twice the amount
transplanted for you next time.

623
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,476
I promise.

624
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,560
-What...
-Come on.

625
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,145
Wait a moment.

626
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:53,897
A-jung.

627
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,608
What are you saying?

628
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,488
I feel like I'll stain
my conscience doing this.

629
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,407
Let's just go.

630
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,245
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,789
We'll come back.

632
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:11,999
Sorry.

633
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,917
Dad, let's go.

634
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,169
He should really plant some hair.

635
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,061
NA A-JUNG

636
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,863
I thought we were done talking.

637
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,815
Did you have a change of heart?

638
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,651
You should never take back

639
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,653
what you gave.

640
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,198
I never said I'd take that money back.

641
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,407
You said things

642
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,286
like you saved it from work yourself.

643
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,455
Why did you tell me that?

644
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:34,998
They say

645
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,961
you should never touch money
that's in your savings account.

646
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:40,962
So?

647
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,006
You want Do-han instead?

648
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,258
You're so crazy about your brother.

649
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,302
I get that you love him.

650
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,555
-Have a drink.
-No thanks.

651
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,809
I never drink with strangers.

652
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,229
Fine, then I'll call Do-han to join me.

653
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,160
Let me ask,

654
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,873
why are you so nosy about his business?

655
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,126
The only thing I want

656
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,044
is his happiness.

657
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,129
Right.

658
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,339
But that's really weird.

659
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,550
Younger brothers never think that.

660
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:32,889
Normally, they'd only think
about taking their older brother's stuff.

661
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:34,558
But "happiness"?

662
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,394
That's creepy.

663
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,480
Shouldn't you say "touching" instead?

664
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,193
Do you owe him your life or something?

665
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,195
Yes.

666
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,865
I lived thanks to him.

667
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,284
His happiness is my happiness.

668
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,663
So I always want the best for him.

669
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,958
That really is creepy.

670
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,669
That's normal to me. Is that so wrong?

671
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,505
No, there's nothing wrong with that.

672
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:09,009
But it sounds kind of suffocating.

673
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,303
Are you saying I'm suffocating him?

674
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,973
No, I mean it must be suffocating for you.

675
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:22,147
You look anxious and uneasy somehow
when you say you want him to be happy.

676
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:28,111
For a split second,
I wondered if Do-han would really be happy

677
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,114
seeing that face on you.

678
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,205
No thanks.

679
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,542
I don't drink more than one glass
with someone I hate.

680
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,712
I've decided
not to be Do-han's girlfriend.

681
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,715
But you don't have to drink.

682
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:53,720
Since I gave your money back,
I was going to make you pay for this.

683
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,722
But I should call Do-han.

684
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,725
Keep your word.

685
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,913
She's Do-han's high school friend.

686
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,541
And they met as soon as he landed here.

687
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,043
I've confirmed

688
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,129
that she was at your birthday party too.

689
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:34,427
I think Do-han's trying
to introduce her to you, sir.

690
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,477
He's quite late.

691
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,731
I guess we should come back next time...

692
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:48,984
What...

693
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,528
Over there.

694
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,491
Is that her?

695
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,618
Do-han's girlfriend?

696
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,787
I think so.

697
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:03,790
What?

698
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,792
Sir.

699
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,918
Wait, that's...

700
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,505
-Ms. Na.
-Yes?

701
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,299
I'll walk you home.

702
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,342
It's fine.

703
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,803
I can go by myself.

704
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,931
I just have to keep going straight.

705
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:25,687
Who knows if you'll turn around
and go to Do-han's house?

706
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:32,027
Do you follow girls to their homes
when you're drunk?

707
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,904
Hey, you're talking

708
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,366
as if I'm some kind of wolf.

709
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,119
Hey,

710
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:45,874
I'm a 32-year-old fox
who's scarier than a wolf.

711
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,171
I'm scared! Go away, old fox...

712
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,060
You're totally wasted.

713
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,605
I should take you home.

714
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,650
I'll take you home.

715
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,406
Taxi!

716
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,993
-Taxi.
-It's here.

717
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,078
What?

718
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:35,882
-Where should I go, driver?
-Where should I go, driver?

719
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,258
Sir?

720
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,843
Drive us to his house.

721
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,095
No,

722
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,179
go to hers first.

723
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,305
No,

724
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,599
we should go to yours first.

725
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,142
Go to his house.

726
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,395
Please drive safely.

727
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,479
All right...

728
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,649
His grandfather's

729
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,277
the chairman of LJ Group.

730
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,531
He's a very precious man!

731
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:03,076
Don't go around telling people that.

732
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,994
My grandfather will hate it.

733
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:06,955
Why?

734
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,039
I don't know.

735
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,834
My grandfather hates me.

736
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:12,752
Why?

737
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:14,587
Do-han hates me,

738
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,423
and you hate me.

739
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:18,133
Everyone does.

740
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,342
No!

741
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,803
I like you.

742
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,932
I like anyone who buys me drinks.

743
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,225
-Really?
-Yes!

744
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,185
-Then I'll buy again.
-Really?

745
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,187
-Yes!
-Oh, my!

746
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,313
You're the best!

747
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,023
-Yes!
-You're awesome!

748
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,483
Amazing!

749
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,945
We're getting along when we're drunk.

750
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,072
I'll tell you what.

751
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,825
Call your grandfather and bring him here.

752
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,785
I'll scold him for you.

753
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,287
How?

754
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,248
"Grandfather."

755
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,377
"Why would you hate someone like him?"

756
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,504
"Please like him."

757
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,506
"Please love him."

758
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,467
Hey, he's really scary.

759
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,343
You'll freeze in front of him.

760
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,180
Hey, don't worry about that.

761
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,140
You know my nickname?

762
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,517
It's "Princess."

763
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:10,685
Princess?

764
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,061
I can make anyone listen.

765
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,648
I mean, the fact that he's the chairman

766
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,985
doesn't mean he can hate his grandsons

767
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,696
or force them to marry someone

768
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,782
and succeed a company
when they don't want to.

769
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,367
He can't do that.

770
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,537
Do-han's refusing it all

771
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:32,207
because of you. To marry you.

772
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,000
Hey.

773
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:38,505
Do you know why he wants to marry me?

774
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:39,547
I don't.

775
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,926
By the way, do you think I'm cute?

776
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,139
Do-han

777
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:51,935
has no one to talk to but me.

778
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,270
I'm the only one

779
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,606
he can be honest with.

780
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,858
He has no one but me.

781
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,278
Even if I'm cute,

782
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,113
you can't

783
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,407
keep liking Do-han.

784
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,243
Oh, no.

785
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,287
Oh, no.

786
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:13,706
Sir.

787
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,791
Yes?

788
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,668
Is this Olympic Expressway?

789
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,961
Yes, it is.

790
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,629
No, we're making a detour.

791
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:20,797
No, we're not.

792
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,298
We're almost there.

793
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,467
You have deviated from the route.

794
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,641
-Make sure to tell them that.
-Okay.

795
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,145
What?

796
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:38,481
Where's A-jung?

797
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,900
Is she dating someone?

798
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,735
She's staying out often.

799
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,737
Whatever.

800
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,239
I don't care.

801
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:48,908
-Mom.
-Yes?

802
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:50,451
Maybe she had a drink.

803
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,330
She sleeps over at her friend's
when she's drunk.

804
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,040
Maybe.

805
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:57,875
I don't care.

806
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,920
Aren't you worried about her?

807
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,214
You've always treated A-jung

808
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,884
as though she was
a stray cat you picked up.

809
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:10,888
Why did you follow them to the hospital?

810
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,807
You know she got fired

811
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,518
and doesn't have any money.

812
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,979
You're terrible.

813
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,356
It's not that.

814
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,649
I can tell

815
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,235
something's going on with her.

816
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,994
MR. KIM

817
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,292
Hello?

818
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:58,645
What is...

819
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,023
What are you doing here?

820
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,524
I don't know.

821
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,236
I woke up, and I was here.

822
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:11,991
Come on.

823
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,160
Tell him what happened.

824
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,912
I don't know either.

825
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,163
What?

826
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,040
Would I be here if I remember?

827
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,417
Sit down and eat.

828
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:24,212
Set the table for Do-han too.

829
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,296
Yes, sir.

830
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,353
What will you do if I say no?

831
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:41,854
Tell me.

832
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:49,153
If I oppose to you marrying her like I did
with your parents, what will you do?

833
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,949
Will you give up everything
like your mother

834
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,535
and choose her?

835
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,454
Yes.

836
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,251
Even when she received money
from your brother?

837
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:08,840
And why can't you be honest
with everyone except her?

838
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,179
Do you know why he wants to marry me?

839
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,099
Do-han has no one to talk to but me.

840
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,603
I'm the only one he can be honest with.

841
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,233
Why can't you answer?

842
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,611
What are you hiding from me?

843
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,829
I'll break up.

844
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,038
A-jung.

845
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,498
You'll break up?

846
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,208
Yes,

847
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,002
I will.

848
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,129
I'm not that stupid.

849
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,840
You called me here

850
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,801
to make me say this myself.

851
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:59,265
Was your relationship
that easy to give up on?

852
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,142
We can remain...

853
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:03,478
What?

854
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,647
I guess we can't be friends either.

855
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:10,443
I understand.

856
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:16,115
So you don't need to go this far
to oppose us.

857
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:21,120
Please give Do-han
what you were planning on giving.

858
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,791
I don't want Do-han to give up anything

859
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,417
because of me.

860
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:28,961
Hey.

861
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:42,683
A-jung.

862
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:47,814
You said I seemed like a stranger.
That's what I feel about you. Who are you?

863
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,067
I was shocked when I got the call.

864
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,278
How did you end up drinking with Ji-han?

865
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:57,156
Why did you sleep there? And the money...

866
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,324
I'm sorry.

867
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:03,704
I didn't mean to do all that.
It just happened, I guess.

868
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:04,789
I'm really sorry.

869
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:10,294
Is talking about me
something that "just happens"?

870
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,255
Are you worried I told him?

871
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,633
I remember that.
I never said a word about it.

872
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,885
-I mean it.
-You did.

873
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,764
You said you'd break up with me
and told him to give me the company.

874
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,143
Wait.

875
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,314
This is ridiculous.

876
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,443
What should I have said, then?

877
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:37,029
He was even mentioning your parents.

878
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:40,700
Should I have taken your hand
and run away with you?

879
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,786
You don't even care why I lied, do you?

880
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,999
You and I

881
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,962
seem to think differently
about what friendship is.

882
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,256
To me, a good friend is someone

883
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,926
who tells you
that you can overcome anything,

884
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,805
not runs away with you
when you face trouble.

885
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,140
A-jung.

886
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,433
Telling someone

887
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,185
to overcome something can be cruel.

888
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,815
And saying you trust them
could be the heaviest burden.

889
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,361
I thought you of all people would know.

890
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,989
I overestimated our friendship.

891
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,200
Hey!

892
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,882
You're looking down these days. What's up?

893
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,800
It's been chaos

894
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:42,511
ever since Do-han came.

895
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,138
So just stop.

896
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,641
Deciding to marry is so hard.

897
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,185
You did it once.

898
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,187
Right.

899
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,189
Why did you decide it?

900
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,231
I don't know,

901
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,192
it was too long ago.

902
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,280
Well,

903
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,199
my ideal type

904
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,161
was someone
who could make anything special.

905
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:08,746
That's me.

906
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,540
What?

907
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,835
This is ordinary food,
and the river's always the same.

908
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,754
But this is nice.

909
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:23,928
Yes, it is.

910
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,054
I knew it.

911
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,348
You're perfect

912
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,517
for my brother.

913
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,726
Do-han's the same.

914
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,895
You're using every chance you have.

915
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:34,689
-Of course.
-Jeez.

916
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,442
I just can't relax
when it comes to you two.

917
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,862
I have to make extra sure
you get married...

918
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,866
Right, making...

919
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,120
extra sure.

920
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:53,040
Hey, your friend is
in the entertainment business, right?

921
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,125
Yes?

922
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,209
Can I ask a favor?

923
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:01,340
The role of the female lead's friend?
That's awesome!

924
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:02,550
Tell me about it.

925
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,303
We've felt so bad since you got fired.

926
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,388
Right.

927
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,597
Writer Hong Bo-ra,

928
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,099
Director Park Tae-pil?

929
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:12,643
It'll be a masterpiece!

930
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,562
But how did you get cast?

931
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,565
The director saw her acting
in an indie film.

932
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:23,195
Ji-ae, Jong-hee. I'm going to think
this is my last chance and do my best.

933
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,907
You know I learned
so many things just in case?

934
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,995
I can shoot in water
or fall from the sky if I have to.

935
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:35,207
I'll show them
that I'm ready for anything.

936
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,835
You need a bigger dream.

937
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,546
Just earning a living is too humble.

938
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,256
Get your dad new hair!

939
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,340
Yes!

940
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,009
-Buy your mom a gift!
-Yes!

941
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,428
-Buy a building!
-Yes!

942
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,390
Thanks.

943
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,189
I'm here.

944
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:05,029
What kind of grownup does she want to be?

945
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,323
-Dad.
-Yes?

946
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,158
Is Auntie not a grownup yet?

947
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:10,951
Ji-oh.

948
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,412
Getting old doesn't make you a grownup.

949
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,540
She's just an old child.

950
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,167
Old child...

951
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:21,921
Oh, my gosh!

952
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:25,174
Dad, let's go
get that transplant tomorrow.

953
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,343
Mom!

954
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,095
My mom.

955
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:32,431
Let's buy that massage chair you wanted.

956
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:35,810
You little brat. Be quiet and go inside.

957
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,106
We should really marry her off
and get rid of her.

958
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,482
I won't get married.

959
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,110
I'm going to live as a baby forever here.

960
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:49,490
You have to take care of me until I'm 50!

961
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,243
Does she need a whipping to wake up?

962
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,120
-Honey! Wait!
-No!

963
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,247
-Mom!
-Honey!

964
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,124
-Honey, stop!
-You little...

965
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:03,170
You're a terrible mom
if you can't take care of me until I'm 60!

966
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,880
-Shut up!
-Mom.

967
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,925
You stepped on me.

968
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,934
Director! Hello.

969
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,229
Oh, you're here.

970
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:23,149
I prepared a lot for the shoot.

971
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:26,735
I'll do my best so I won't disappoint you.

972
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,195
-Sure.
-Great.

973
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,780
As I told you,

974
00:57:30,406 --> 00:57:33,284
the most important thing
is not to have scandals

975
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,703
regarding your personal life.

976
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,037
Be careful.

977
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,164
Yes, of course.

978
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:41,208
I'll keep in mind that you don't want

979
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:42,918
-any scandals.
-Yes.

980
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,545
Just go and get ready.

981
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,921
Okay. I'll get ready.

982
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,631
-Tell the team.
-Okay.

983
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:49,383
Let's start shooting.

984
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:08,694
Mr. Lee?

985
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:10,905
Mr. Lee?

986
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,198
It's really you.

987
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,158
What are you doing here?

988
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,202
To see me?

989
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:17,828
Why would I come for you?

990
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,997
I work here. LJ Department Store.

991
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,252
I see. But why are you so grumpy?

992
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:28,464
What are you doing here, then?

993
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:29,506
Me?

994
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,383
I'm shooting here.

995
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,057
Where's my mirror?

996
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:44,521
How do I look?

997
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,274
How's my makeup?

998
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:48,692
Not too much?

999
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:53,447
It doesn't show much with so much light,
so I put some on.

1000
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,407
Is it okay?

1001
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,327
My lips.

1002
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,871
What are you doing?

1003
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,083
I'm asking you to check if it's okay.

1004
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,294
Your heart pounded.

1005
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,129
-What?
-Yes.

1006
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,507
-What, my heart?
-Yes, because of me.

1007
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,591
Because of you?

1008
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:13,717
It did!

1009
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:15,761
Awesome.

1010
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:18,889
I'm going to make everyone fall for me.

1011
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:20,557
Thanks for the coffee.

1012
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,810
And good luck with work.

1013
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,145
My heart never pounded.

1014
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,730
Hey, I mean it.

1015
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,276
That little...

1016
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,004
What are you smiling at?

1017
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,423
When did I smile?

1018
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,300
Just now.

1019
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:57,928
Like this.

1020
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:03,892
What?

1021
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:05,519
Isn't that Na A-jung?

1022
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:07,646
Is it?

1023
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,565
Who cares? Let's go.

1024
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,747
Everyone's working really hard.

1025
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,540
The actors are doing great.

1026
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,292
Especially the friend role.

1027
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,296
She got in through her connections, right?

1028
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:38,218
She was all excited, not even knowing
that it was chaos here because of her.

1029
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:42,264
I guess you have to
be so shameless to steal roles.

1030
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:46,894
I just feel sorry
for the actress who had her role stolen.

1031
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,355
She took so many auditions.

1032
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,398
The director liked her.

1033
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,483
I know, right?

1034
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,490
Hello.

1035
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:01,867
Was that

1036
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,869
about me?

1037
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,623
Using my connections?

1038
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:09,833
When?

1039
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:10,918
Ji-oh, say bye.

1040
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,544
-Bye.
-Bye.

1041
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:13,796
I'll talk to him.

1042
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,130
Okay. Bye.

1043
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:16,215
Let's go.

1044
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,051
Ji-oh.

1045
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,554
Did you say you ate kimchi
when you didn't?

1046
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,060
I told you, lying is bad.

1047
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:32,231
Being honest and getting scolded
will make you a good adult.

1048
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,650
It wasn't just me.

1049
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,904
Si-hyun and Hae-bom lied about it too.

1050
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,032
They did it yesterday too,

1051
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,784
but no one knew.

1052
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,079
Right, no one might have known,

1053
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,416
but one person would have.

1054
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:51,750
Who?

1055
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,961
Yourself.

1056
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:57,881
No one may know,
but you know that it's wrong.

1057
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:01,009
Ms. Na, stand at the T-bar here.

1058
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,094
Okay.

1059
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,389
Walk from there to here.

1060
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:06,473
Okay.

1061
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,852
If you're ready, let's go.

1062
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,645
Roll camera.

1063
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:13,564
All right.

1064
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:29,788
Ms. Na, what...

1065
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:30,873
What's wrong?

1066
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:32,666
What is it?

1067
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,049
Excuse me.

1068
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,093
Where's the actress Na A-jung?

1069
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:44,178
Na A-jung?

1070
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:45,637
Who's that?

1071
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,055
The lead's friend.

1072
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,515
Oh, her.

1073
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:49,683
She went home.

1074
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,310
What? Why?

1075
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,686
I'm curious too.

1076
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,190
She suddenly apologized
and said she couldn't do it.

1077
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,568
Did she think this was some playground?

1078
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,582
I heard you passed an audition
and got a good role.

1079
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:16,210
I don't need a massage chair.

1080
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,295
I'm so happy for you.

1081
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,339
I know you can do it! Good luck!

1082
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,645
I knew you would succeed.

1083
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,147
I need that hair transplant. Great job!

1084
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,229
Get in.

1085
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,065
Come on.

1086
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:42,379
Are you crazy?

1087
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,007
Why would you suddenly quit?

1088
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,467
You're going to miss

1089
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:49,761
such a good opportunity?

1090
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,266
I heard somewhere

1091
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,436
there are three steps

1092
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,646
between two people.

1093
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,108
One less step makes a misunderstanding

1094
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:06,320
and one more makes an understanding.

1095
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,404
Just three steps.

1096
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:12,618
And you know what it is if you take more?

1097
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:13,785
What is it?

1098
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:17,122
What do you think?
Meddling without knowing your place.

1099
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,335
Why did I suddenly quit?

1100
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,920
You dare to ask me that?

1101
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,964
Did you just punch me? Seriously?

1102
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,716
What upsets me the most

1103
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:31,345
isn't that you got me a role
I didn't ask for,

1104
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,472
but that

1105
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:37,684
I want to call the director and beg him
to just give me a chance.

1106
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,396
I know that it's wrong to pretend

1107
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,565
I don't know anything,

1108
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:45,484
but I just want to do my best.

1109
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,944
That angers me the most.

1110
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:49,738
Do you even get it?

1111
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:54,326
If I hadn't gone to the bathroom...

1112
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,996
No, if I hadn't come out at that time...

1113
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:02,000
Then I would have just thought

1114
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,586
that I really got a good opportunity.

1115
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,839
Who are you...

1116
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,720
to make me have such regrets?

1117
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,349
I get it, so get in the car.

1118
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,684
Cabs don't stop here.

1119
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,895
What makes you really awful

1120
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,315
is that you made me hate myself, not you.

1121
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:26,775
You know that?

1122
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,470
The logic of life

1123
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:58,557
is that you can't always be happy.

1124
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:03,228
You suffer at one point in your life.

1125
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,940
When that moment comes, think of me.

1126
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,694
Because that's when my wish has come true.

1127
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,968
You asked if I'll miss the opportunity.

1128
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,305
I won't.

1129
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,023
Do-han.

1130
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:50,275
No,

1131
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,360
nothing's up.

1132
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:55,447
I'll do it.

1133
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,949
I'll marry you.

1134
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:36,279
Choose.

1135
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,531
Is it me or her?

1136
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,492
I'll get exploited
and abandoned if I marry.

1137
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,993
It's not a baby, right?

1138
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,829
-Here.
-You won't regret it?

1139
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:44,913
I'm getting married.

1140
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:45,997
What?

1141
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:48,667
An elopement. That's what we'll do.

1142
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,377
I just became a cupid for them.

1143
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:53,588
Who are you?

1144
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:54,714
Are you both frauds?

1145
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,800
Do you like Ji-han?

1146
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,552
I thought it was always him.

1147
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,931
There seems to be only one way
to fix this problem with Na A-jung.
