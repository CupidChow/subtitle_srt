1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,760
   
   

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,870
   
   

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,320
   

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,130
   

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,930
     

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,180
   

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,180
   

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,150
   

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,900
   

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,770


11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,260
   

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,290
I asked for today's press conference because there's one thing I must correct

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,360
while apologizing publicly.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,020
As per what you know currently,

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,290
the scandal with my brother, his fiancée,

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,740
and myself isn't true as it stands.

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,700
 She did nothing wrong. 

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,100
 I followed her around on my own. 

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,450
 The only correct fact regarding this scandal is 

20
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,290
 the fact that... 

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,440
 I have feelings for her. 

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,900
 That I really like her. 

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,910
 That's all. 

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
That much is...

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,560
true.

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,490
 I'm stating my last lie. 

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,190
 I'm sorry I couldn't be honest as we promised. 

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,230
Anything besides what I just stated is nothing more than wrongful assumptions and rumors.

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,590
She has never betrayed my brother, nor has she ever had feelings for me.

30
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,840
Liar.

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,340
- Sis! 
 - A Jeong!

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,650
- A Jeong! 
 - Sis!

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,320
 I still don't have any regrets. 

34
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,910
 Even if the world doesn't know, 

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,860
 I'm happy as long as you know my sincerity. 

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,210
 Even if I abandon all that I am, 

37
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,280
 I'm happy if I can just protect you. 

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,530
 You can resent me for making this decision. 

39
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,230
 Please, just don't feel sorry. 

40
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,410
 Please... 

41
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,620
 cry just a little, 

42
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,670
 laugh a lot, 

43
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,580
 and be quick to forget. 

44
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,350
   

45
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,530
Grandfather.

46
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,540
You fool.

47
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,600
Your grandpa gave you so many chances to keep it down and move on quietly all this time.

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:08,500
But must you tell the world about what kind of person you always were to make yourself happy?

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,420
You knew the truth all this time?

50
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,590
Did you really think your grandpa didn't know anything, then?

51
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,940
How could that be...

52
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,720
But since when...

53
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,360
 This was sent to Grandfather anonymously. 

54
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,650
 What else are you dishonest about in front of other people besides this lady? 

55
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,450
 What are you trying to hide from your grandpa? 

56
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,050
 If you're scared, don't run away and 

57
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,050
 grow your power in that seat. 

58
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,350
 That's how you can protect yourself and your people. 

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,100
So, from the beginning, you knew...

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,000
You were the one who had people follow me in the U.S. and had those pictures exposed, Grandfather?

61
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,440
I-It's not true. Right?

62
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,020
You didn't do those things. Right?

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,110
How can you go this far?

64
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,850
Why would you go this far?

65
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,640
"Why?"

66
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,190
Because I'm your grandpa.

67
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,750
I'm doing this all for you guys because you're my grandsons.

68
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,080
You know what happened to your mom because she didn't listen to me even to the end.

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,390
Fine, let's just say you did all those things for our sake.

70
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,300
But that's all the more reason you shouldn't stop this press conference!

71
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,770
You saw how Ji Han and A Jeong were treated because of me.

72
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,830
I went through so much to make this decision.

73
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,650
However, that decision of yours.

74
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,340
Don't be confused and think you decided this for those two.

75
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,770
Did you really even think about this?

76
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,960
If you tell the world what kind of a person you really are,

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,050
did you think those two would be at peace?

78
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,720
Are you sure it's not just to put yourself at ease?

79
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,020
- That's— 
 - Yes, that's...

80
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,560
you making a selfish decision again and using those two as an excuse.

81
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,900
You're running away again.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,770
Chairman.

83
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,120
Right now, Ji Han is...

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
Ji Han!

85
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,340
Lee Ji Han!

86
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,410
A Jeong.

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,380
It's making me angry now.

88
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,170
I've run out of tears, too.

89
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,350
He told me not to cry and made me stop crying like this.

90
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,500
He told me to laugh, and this is how he makes me laugh.

91
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,970
Your brother really has an innovative thought process.

92
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,560
Where am I supposed to vent now?

93
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,600
At myself for starting a ridiculous fake marriage from the beginning?

94
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,110
Or at that moron for leaving me with the most ridiculous breakup?

95
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,870
It must be right to blame the one who's not here.

96
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,610
Where the heck did Lee Ji Han go?

97
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,680
You're supposed to blame me.

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
It's not like you don't know.

99
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,700
As you said before,

100
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,250
I'm the one who first started the act that should've ended in high school

101
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,350
and failed to bring it to an end.

102
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,920
I tried to bring it to an end.

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,270
And I wanted to make it a good one.

104
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,010
But it didn't work out.

105
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,620
I don't even know how to end it now, and...

106
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,290
I'm back to square one.

107
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,800
Go inside and get some rest.

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,450
I'll search for Ji Han more.

109
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,790
A Jeong.

110
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,180
Sorry.

111
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,400
Let me know when Lee Ji Han contacts you.

112
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,180
What on earth is happening?

113
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,380
Honey,

114
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,470
I think I really went back to that day.

115
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,300
The day we came to greet the parents and confessed about getting pregnant.

116
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,920
Look! Even my body reacted.

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,470
Wow, my back and my guts both hurt.

118
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,030
Shouldn't we just tell them honestly?

119
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,450
That A Jeong's marriage was fake.

120
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,290
- And then? 
 - Still, we can tell them—

121
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,820
That can clear the misunderstanding about her cheating.

122
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,060
Just keep your mouth shut, and don't make things worse.

123
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,410
Sis will take care of—

124
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,590
- But she doesn't take care of things, though! 
 - Exactly!

125
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,230
It seemed like she didn't even know about the press conference.

126
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,350
Gosh, Na A Jeong! Seriously.

127
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,960
What's this?

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,560
- Sis is back. 
 - Okay.

129
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,120
What happened? And what's with the press conference, huh?

130
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,660
- A Jeong! 
 - Sis!

131
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,900
- A Jeong. 
 - Gosh, that's enough already.

132
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,850
He was that kind of punk, to begin with.

133
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,760
If he was in the wrong, he deserves to meet the consequences on his own. Right?

134
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,650
How dare he drag you into it?

135
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,180
Mom,

136
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,600
I told you he's not like that.

137
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,210
Are you going to keep defending him like that?

138
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,980
The marriage wasn't even real to begin with.

139
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,270
- What? 
 - Sis—

140
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,450
It was all a lie.

141
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,770
It was all an act.

142
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,920
I fooled all of you.

143
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,050
What are you saying right now?

144
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,160
I agreed to disguise marrying him because Do Han had a situation.

145
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,300
He said he'd wrap things up nicely after three years.

146
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,800
- And he'll give me money, too. 
 - That's enough.

147
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,450
But he said I'm the only one for the role.

148
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,190
I guess I wanted to do something like this...

149
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,460
for once in my life.

150
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,220
Instead of supporting roles and extras I do every day,

151
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,290
I guess I wanted to take a role like this one for once.

152
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,450
That's why things ended up this way.

153
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,900
They were all my choices.

154
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,750
But he's doing that to take all the blame alone.

155
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,460
It's my fault for lying to you, Mom and Dad...

156
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,900
But he's the person I like.

157
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,240
He grew on me.

158
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,540
I can't live without him anymore,

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,840
but I don't even know where he is right now.

160
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,210
What am I supposed to do at times like this?

161
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,570
What am I supposed to do?

162
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,220
What took you so long?

163
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,970
Why did you do that?

164
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,040
Because it's the right thing.

165
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,130
You answer too easily.

166
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,690
I know it was hard to come to that decision.

167
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,370
Brother,

168
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,030
I'm really okay.

169
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,020
How can you possibly be okay?

170
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,660
- Because of me, people are— 
 - This is why I came.

171
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,860
- Because of me, people are— 
 - This is why I came.

172
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,200
I was worried you'd think this way.

173
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,660
I'm sorry for making you shoulder

174
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,680
unnecessary burden all this time, saying it was for your good.

175
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,780
However,

176
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,580
I quit doing things for your sake...

177
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,880
when I didn't want to.

178
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,340
I told you back then.

179
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,970
Let's go our own ways and live happily now.

180
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,840
I only made my choice.

181
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,370
Sorry.

182
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,370
I'm really sorry.

183
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,420
Do I need to repeat myself again?

184
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,900
I don't have time for that.

185
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,020
Also, do you think I only came for you?

186
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,630
How's A Jeong?

187
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,150
Go see her for yourself.

188
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,590
I don't want to get beat up.

189
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,070
She was having a really hard time.

190
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,430
As expected.

191
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,630
I couldn't bear to see that.

192
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,370
Please be by her side for a while in my place.

193
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,430
- What about you? 
 - Don't tell her you met me.

194
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,030
I want her to...

195
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,580
forget me as soon as possible.

196
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,540
I'll go now.

197
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,540
Yes, Father.

198
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,810
Of course, I'm already meeting the board members who are on Grandfather's side.

199
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,370
It seems they're not quite happy right now.

200
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,370
They seemed actually thankful we reached out to them first.

201
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,860
 Still, don't let your guard down until the board meeting. 

202
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,910
 From what I hear, the board seems concerned about doing business with Taeyang. 

203
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,770
Of course.

204
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,170
I already told you.

205
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,880
Taeyang won't just sit by and watch.

206
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,610
It's not like we didn't expect it. We just need to take our time and prepare.

207
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,000
 All right. It seems you've got things under control, so I won't worry too much. 

208
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Also, Father, even if this were to go wrong,

209
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,640
we still have a hand we didn't play.

210
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,540
Yes.

211
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,210
I can't believe he still kept that day's recording.

212
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,640
What on earth are you hiding, Grandfather?

213
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,540
You really don't know where Lee Ji Han is?

214
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,190
I'm not hiding it. I couldn't find him anywhere in the country.

215
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,780
I said the same thing back when A Jeong was here, too.

216
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,280
Jong Hee, is it still not done?

217
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,090
I just need to put some fruit.

218
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,700
Ji Ae, I feel very threatened right now,

219
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,600
but I'm your other half.

220
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,620
And A Jeong is my friend.

221
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,600
I really don't know.

222
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,320
You have no idea?

223
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,660
A Jeong is in a terrible state, trying to find that man right now!

224
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,780
I mean, I don't...

225
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,480
I don't think we'll get an answer, Unni.

226
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
- Let's go see A Jeong. 
 - Okay.

227
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,490
You packed all the food, right?

228
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,720
Yes, I packed porridge, soup, stew, fruits, large intestine, and chicken feet.

229
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,810
Everything that's easy on your stomach.

230
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,160
Eun Taek, I'll let you go today.

231
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,400
But not a chance next time.

232
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,900
I hope you find out where Lee Ji Han is quickly.

233
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,200
And keep an eye on the store.

234
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,690
Gosh, where the heck is Ji Han, and what's he doing?

235
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,010
Gosh, I'm worried!

236
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,910
♫  It was so nice when we shared those heartwarming words  ♫

237
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,700
♫  Back then, we gave and received love  ♫

238
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,910
The sun's still up?

239
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,250
The time is passing so slowly.

240
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,270
♫  I'll carefully share it all  ♫

241
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,830
♫  So we don't get hurt anymore  ♫

242
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,970
♫  The place where the well-rounded you and I will meet  ♫

243
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,450
 Come back when I'm telling you nicely. 

244
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,100
 Or else. I won't let you get away with this. 

245
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,520
 It can't be. Right? We're not really finished like this. Right? 

246
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,540
 You went away briefly. Right? You'll come back. Right? 

247
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:59,700
♫  It was great, we were smiling all the time  ♫

248
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:08,340
♫  You said you'll tell me all the things you love in a small voice  ♫

249
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,210
♫  You said we'll be together forever  ♫

250
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,840
Mr. Driver, one moment.

251
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,700
♫  I'll carefully share it all  ♫

252
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,290
♫  So we don't get hurt anymore  ♫

253
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:35,290
♫  The place where the well-rounded you and I will meet  ♫

254
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:43,150
♫  I love this place, and I'm sure you're the same  ♫

255
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,820
♫  How can you be so much like this?  ♫

256
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,440
 I went to your house again today. 

257
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,620
 Just when will you come? 

258
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,670
 If you won't come, I'll go. 

259
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,900
 I take back saying you can't get away with this. 

260
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,440
 So reply at the very least. I'm about to lose it. 

261
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,040
 Why won't you even come out in my dream? 

262
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,740
 I'm waiting for you. 

263
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,340
 I think of you every day. 

264
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,870
 How come not even once... 

265
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,990
 I miss you, Lee Ji Han. 

266
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,310
Did he see my texts?

267
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,480
Maybe he didn't?

268
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,670
Even if he did, it wouldn't matter.

269
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,440
Stop sending them. You won't get a reply anyway.

270
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,040
How can I get a reply?

271
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,590
Eat something for now.

272
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,560
What if you pass out like this?

273
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,360
Would he reply if he heard I passed out?

274
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,580
Hey, that's enough. I'll really get mad.

275
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,400
The time is passing so slowly.

276
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,120
Gosh, I'm tired. I feel so sleepy.

277
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,520
I wish he'd be in front of me when I close and open my eyes.

278
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,320
I think it'll take a very long time.

279
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,730
I should sleep for a long time.

280
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,750
Not as long as hibernation,

281
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,800
but it should be at least half as long.

282
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,920
Sis, Secretary Kim's calling you.

283
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,550
What's this?

284
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,040
Hello?

285
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,200
What on earth do you mean by that?

286
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,270
I'm telling you to just get married.

287
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,090
What you wanted to do originally.

288
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,800
If you do that, you can protect Do Han's secret and

289
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,030
Do Han will get the company, too.

290
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,580
Wait, so, what do you mean...

291
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,530
I guess he didn't tell you I knew everything from the start.

292
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,210
What a fool.

293
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,610
What a weakling. He's way too softhearted.

294
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,880
I told him so many times, but he's still the same.

295
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,850
A Jeong, I'm asking you to convince Do Han in my place.

296
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,420
I can't...

297
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,040
I-I don't think I can do that.

298
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,000
What are you saying?

299
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,960
Are you saying you can't marry him?

300
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,820
I'm telling you, I won't.

301
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,050
How can you...

302
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,610
How can you do this?

303
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,320
I already told you everything.

304
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,120
Lee Ji Han's press conference isn't true at all, and

305
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,170
I also have feelings for Lee Ji Han.

306
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,760
If I marry Do Han like this, what about Lee Ji Han?

307
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,750
Will Lee Ji Han just become a bastard who loved his sister-in-law?

308
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,310
Couldn't you be the reason Ji Han made that decision?

309
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,200
All right. We couldn't stop Ji Han.

310
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,520
But we need to stop Do Han, don't we?

311
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,980
You can't let Do Han do the wrong thing because of you, can you?

312
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,780
What do you... What do you mean by that?

313
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,560
Do Han had prepared a press conference to confess all his secrets.

314
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,780
His secrets he wanted to hide more than anything.

315
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,180
A Jeong, are you able to watch

316
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:54,440
both Ji Han and Do Han give up everything because of you?

317
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,530
If that's not the case,

318
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,250
you can just do what you were going to do originally.

319
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm very sorry.

320
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,560
I don't think I need to hear anything more.

321
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,150
Grandfather,

322
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,290
I have a question.

323
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,490
How could that be for their sake?

324
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,420
Seriously, what's wrong with everyone?

325
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,520
The grandfather and the grandchildren are all saying it's for the others' sake.

326
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,800
- What? 
 - Grandfather,

327
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,740
your grandchildren are too kind and softhearted,

328
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,050
so I don't think they told you anything.

329
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,690
I'll tell you something in their place.

330
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,840
A real grandfather wouldn't

331
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,490
call his grandchildren "a fool, a bastard, a punk, or a weakling."

332
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,660
It's right to call them "my dear and my treasure."

333
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,940
Even if your grandchildren are over 30, the only nagging you should do is

334
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,090
tell them like they're three-year-old kids. To use the overpass instead of the crosswalk,

335
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,100
not to dress dark at night,

336
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,120
and always bring an umbrella.

337
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,930
You're supposed to say these things.

338
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,960
That's how you really care for them, you see.

339
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,770
What I'm saying is...

340
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,530
You need to treat them well.

341
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,520
 I tried to bring it to an end. 

342
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,890
 And I wanted to make it a good one. 

343
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,840
 But it didn't work out. 

344
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,320
So, it was then...

345
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,270
 What's that? 

346
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,650
 Look over there. 

347
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,600
 - What's he saying? 
 - What? 

348
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,410
 I just don't get it. 

349
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,320
 Everything my brother, Lee Ji Han, said at the press conference last time is false. 

350
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,300
 In the first place, this marriage was a fake one, trying to hide my sexual preference. 

351
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,750
 A Jeong, what's all this about? 

352
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,980
 A fake marriage? 

353
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,730
 - Are you okay? 
 - Is this true? 

354
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,140
 A Jeong, what's this about? 

355
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,680
   
 To reiterate... 

356
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,250
 what my brother said last time was untrue. 

357
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,770
Lee Do Han, are you crazy?

358
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,420
 A Jeong, please hear me out first. 

359
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,620
 I really want to say this to you. 

360
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,060
First of all, you were shocked. Right? I'm sorry.

361
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,930
But even if I told you in advance

362
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,590
 and even if you tried to stop me, nothing would've changed. 

363
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,990
 You told me last time. 

364
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,480
A really good friend doesn't run away with you

365
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,610
but stays with you to the end, trusting that you could do this.

366
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,720
I hope you'll do the same again.

367
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,340
And now that I think about it, this was my own choice,

368
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,410
so I can live as myself in the first place.

369
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,600
So I hope you won't feel guilty for no reason.

370
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,600
But still, how could you do this?

371
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,510
 I know. Right? 

372
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,240
I confessed our marriage being fake and

373
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,150
violated the confidentiality clause.

374
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,850
But I can't help it.

375
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,360
This contract will have to be breached at this point.

376
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,890
 But you know, right? 

377
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,630
 Item 11 of Article 10, Breach of Friendship Prevention. 

378
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,560
No matter what happens, the client and the cast's friendship comes first.

379
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,930
This clause remains in effect even after this contract is breached.

380
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,290
 I'm saying, although this contract is over now, 

381
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,550
you're still my friend for life.

382
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,600
Yes, this is right.

383
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,770
Pretending to be your lover was really...

384
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,160
Why you little...

385
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,330
 I'll call you soon. Take care. 

386
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,430
I'm so sorry even to the end, and

387
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,380
thank you, my friend, Na A Jeong.

388
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,480
Who knew Lee Do Han had such a secret?

389
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,110
Then Jeong Dae Hyeon is also...

390
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,870
Anyhow, it's ultimately for the better for you.

391
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,290
I heard the news.

392
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,050
You're inches away from taking over LJ.

393
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,960
Thanks.

394
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,800
But that's not why I wanted to see you today.

395
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,360
Could it be you found the CCTV?

396
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,540
Oh, no, no.

397
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,600
Before that, there's something I want to know.

398
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,480
What's on that CCTV that you're going through so much to find?

399
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,140
What are you so frustrated about?

400
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,540
You wouldn't believe it even if I told you.

401
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,430
That's up to me to decide.

402
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,770
Okay.

403
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,790
Fine, then.

404
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,330
I'll tell you.

405
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,630
The day I was tailing Hyeon Soo Hyeon, your mother, after finding out her whereabouts,

406
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,280
I had someone accompanying me.

407
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,600
Your father, Managing Director Choi.

408
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,450
Presently, President Choi Joong Chan.

409
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,710
The reason I looked into Hyeon Soo Hyeon in the first place was...

410
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,550
 B-Be careful. 

411
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,570
...by President Choi's suggestion.

412
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,870
He was more eager about finding Hyeon Soo Hyeon than Chairman Hyeon.

413
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,260
 Yes, I'm chasing her with Reporter Kang. 

414
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,810
 She definitely won't escape this time. 

415
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,400
Stop that.

416
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,620
 - Pardon? 
 - I said stop! 

417
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,940
 Come home right now. 

418
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,000
 But we'll lose Soo Hyeon again, Father! 

419
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,940
 I'll take care of it myself. So you just stay put. 

420
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,470
 I clearly told you. 

421
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,870
 Father. Father! 

422
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,470
 - What should we do? 
 - What do you mean? 

423
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,440
 Follow her! 

424
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,590
 We'll see an end to this today. 

425
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,500
 What are you doing? Step on it! 

426
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,300
 It's dangerous to speed up more. They have a child in their car. If we get into an accident— 

427
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,300
 That's not my business! Step on it! More! 

428
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,960
I really tried to stop him.

429
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,000
But he was half crazy that day.

430
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,380
 Go this way. 

431
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,890
 What are you doing? You can't— 

432
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,380
In the end...

433
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,890
That's it?

434
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,810
That's why you're so frustrated?

435
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,800
I was treated unfairly after that.

436
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,380
At the time, my car was the only vehicle spotted at the toll gate.

437
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,120
With no other evidence, President Choi's existence was erased,

438
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,470
and I alone had to take the blame for everything.

439
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,810
Based on what I found out later,

440
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,270
there was a private CCTV camera near the accident site.

441
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,960
But even if President Choi didn't know about that,

442
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,110
there's no way Chairman Hyeon didn't know about that CCTV.

443
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,180
 Chairman, our detective found a private CCTV nearby. 

444
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,430
 I think you need to take a look at this. 

445
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,180
His son-in-law caused his only daughter's death,

446
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,390
but I don't understand why he decided to

447
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,290
hide his wrongdoing, either.

448
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:11,520
 Anyhow, it's certain Chairman Hyen knows the truth. 

449
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,590
 Otherwise, why would he tell me to keep quiet about this 

450
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,930
 and even resort to bribing me? 

451
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,850
 He can just say I'm spewing nonsense. 

452
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,120
Dad had killed her in the end...

453
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,270
   

454
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,550
 You knew how I decided to go to you. 

455
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,090
 You knew everything I gave up to go to you. 

456
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,490
 I chose you over my brother, whom I thought was my everything in life. 

457
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,450
 However, I'm not going to run away this time. 

458
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,880
 So, I'm going to protect you and I'm going to protect Ji Han. 

459
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,530
 As per what you know currently, 

460
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,200
 the scandal with my brother, his fiancée, and myself isn't... 

461
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,320
 true as it stands. 

462
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,180
 I followed her around on my own. 

463
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,990
 Are you able to watch both of them give up everything? 

464
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,820
It's really all because of me.

465
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,800
Could I see you for a moment?

466
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,230
It's been a while.

467
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,400
I feel like I saw you very recently.

468
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Articles about the three of you pop up several times a day.

469
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,130
And they all say different things on top of that.

470
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,140
What were you thinking when you did such a thing?

471
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,430
I knew something was off, but a fake marriage?

472
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,540
It was beyond what I could guess.

473
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,640
It's also beyond what I could handle.

474
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,630
I'm already regretting it.

475
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,380
I'm sorry.

476
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,770
For saying things without knowing anything.

477
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,680
It's okay. You didn't know about it.

478
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,020
What are you planning to do now?

479
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,420
That's actually why I wanted to meet you, CEO Yoon.

480
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,480
I need to meet Lee Ji Han to do anything.

481
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,000
But I don't know where he is right now.

482
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,610
If you meet him, are you going to hang onto him?

483
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,510
I'm going to let him go.

484
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm going to wrap things up now.

485
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,300
When I started the relationship with Lee Ji Han,

486
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,440
we agreed to see it to the end, whatever may be in store for us.

487
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,970
We had agreed to go until we saw something.

488
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,480
But I think we've come far enough.

489
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,210
I guess you saw something?

490
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,710
I couldn't see anything at all.

491
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,030
It was just dark.

492
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,680
That was the end for us.

493
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,620
We were clearly standing at the edge.

494
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,760
"I'm sure we'll see if we go further."

495
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:15,270
"I'm sure we'll see if we go further." That's how I was denying it alone.

496
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,160
I was walking in the same spot,

497
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,170
hurting people I cherish.

498
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,850
That's a shame.

499
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,670
I thought you'd make your own decision, A Jeong,

500
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,730
instead of an obvious conclusion like this.

501
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,160
A place where Ji Han might have gone to...

502
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,290
Not sure.

503
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,420
Since we were young, he'd take me to an arcade when I got sad.

504
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,910
But he bottled it up when he was sad because he had nowhere to go.

505
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,860
So I don't really know.

506
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,010
Isn't there anyone else who might know, then?

507
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,930
You, A Jeong.

508
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:59,390
While living like that, I think Ji Han found his breathing room in you, A Jeong.

509
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,550
I think you'd know best if he were to go somewhere.

510
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,270
I've been getting dopamine every day lately.

511
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,600
I had fun watching the news for the first time ever.

512
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,260
Getting dopamine is fine.

513
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm about to go crazy.

514
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,240
Honey, just give up.

515
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,870
- What? 
 - I gave it some thought.

516
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,850
If we're one step ahead,

517
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,820
they move two or three steps ahead.

518
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,710
Just giving up will give you peace.

519
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,290
Gosh, what a great gain for you.

520
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,520
Don't be like that. The board meeting is happening soon.

521
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,420
At this rate, Seung Ah and Father will team up and devour the company.

522
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,770
Shouldn't we side with them, though it may be late?

523
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,070
Nope. Who knows? They might part ways.

524
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:57,750
Gosh, gosh, gosh! Gosh, Honey!

525
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,080
Gosh, why do you even need skincare, huh?

526
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,990
You don't even get stressed out, and your face is full of oil even if you do nothing!

527
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,300
Gosh, seriously, look at all the oil on your face.

528
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,690
Oiliness is a no-can-do.

529
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,980
 It'd be great to live here. 

530
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,690
 There is a mountain and a beach nearby. 

531
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,800
 We can go see flowers in spring, 

532
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,350
 fireworks in summer, 

533
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,820
 foliage in autumn, 

534
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,220
 and snowflakes in winter. 

535
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,610
 Why go see things every season? 

536
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,110
 You just need to see me. 

537
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,930
 I'll just leave you here if you keep this up. 

538
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,110
 All right. 

539
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,400
 You won't hold it? 

540
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,510
Even imaginations talk to me now, huh?

541
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,400
Why is it so vivid?

542
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,330
Why is there a two-way communication?

543
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,720
 Aren't you going to hold it? 

544
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,360
I won't fall for it. You'll disappear if I hold it.

545
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,080
 You should still fall for it. 

546
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,660
Even if I wanted to, you're not up to date with things.

547
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,870
I'm sure the current Na A Jeong is way more violent,

548
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,100
way more aggressive,

549
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,600
and way more resentful toward me.

550
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,430
At times like this, this is how she'd call me.

551
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,340
Hey, Lee Ji Han, do you really want to die?

552
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,860
Yes, that's the correct one.

553
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,450
Seriously.

554
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,390
What am I supposed to do if you're really here?

555
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,360
Have you been doing badly?

556
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,350
Aren't you supposed to ask if I've been doing well?

557
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,900
It's obvious you haven't been doing well.

558
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,340
How bad have you been?

559
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:48,520
I just walked and slept.

560
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,530
Walked some more and slept. That's all.

561
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,820
You really weren't well.

562
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,640
What about you, Na A Jeong?

563
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,640
I also was unwell.

564
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,450
I was going to let you go, and here I go again.

565
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,400
This isn't what I came here for.

566
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,770
The reason I came all this way is...

567
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,150
- Now, I'm going to— 
 - Have you...

568
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,760
eaten?

569
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,970
I'm starving.

570
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,240
Should we eat before we talk?

571
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,420
Just a moment.

572
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,780
   

573
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,260
That was great.

574
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,610
Do you want to go for a walk?

575
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,520
Do you want to do fireworks?

576
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,900
Since we couldn't do it last time.

577
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,320
Wait here for a minute.

578
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,060
   

579
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,020
Shall we go?

580
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,220
It's done.

581
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,910
This one was the last one.

582
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,580
You're right.

583
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,210
There's nothing more to do.

584
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,950
We should do what we really need to do.

585
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,340
I hated you a lot after you left like that.

586
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,310
I wasn't sure what I was going to do about you.

587
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,080
You know what they say.

588
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,770
The best revenge after a breakup is to live happily.

589
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,350
But I wanted to live as miserably as I could.

590
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,440
"Because you left while telling me to laugh,

591
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,660
I should cry more."

592
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,750
"I should cry every single day as if to show you."

593
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,120
"I should bawl my eyes out and lose my voice."

594
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:02,790
"So we should live miserably ever after for a long time."

595
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,960
That's what I thought.

596
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,940
But I'm going to quit it now.

597
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,970
I realized they're all pointless acts.

598
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,630
I think we'll be miserable...

599
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,490
if we get back together.

600
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,010
You heard the news about Do Han. Right?

601
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,380
That story is all over the TV and the internet.

602
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,690
Yes.

603
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,780
Do Han denied it, but it's all because of us.

604
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,180
So, how can we get back together?

605
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,740
I don't want to suffer more.

606
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:15,460
♫  The long days made my heart indifferent  ♫

607
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,370
We really...

608
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,960
gave it all and went through so much.

609
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,000
Be happy from now on.

610
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,100
You, too, Lee Ji Han.

611
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,410
♫  Roses bloom  ♫

612
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,330
♫  But roses bloom  ♫

613
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,730
I really liked you a lot.

614
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,920
♫  The overdue happiness will sprout  ♫

615
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,580
Bye, Lee Ji Han.

616
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,710
♫  Bloom in the end  ♫

617
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,480
♫  Roses bloom  ♫

618
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,520
Bye, Na A Jeong.

619
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,350
♫  But roses bloom  ♫

620
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:40,500
♫  Spring will come again, and it will make them bloom again, in the end  ♫

621
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,360
♫  Beautifully  ♫

622
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,400
   

623
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:06,500
Soo Hyeon, Ji Han is here. 
    

624
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,440
Time goes by so fast.

625
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,750
Nothing much happened, right?

626
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,850
Yes.

627
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:21,760
All right.

628
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,430
It rained like this around this time last year, too.

629
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,540
Nothing is the same...

630
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,220
except that it's raining.

631
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,350
What about Do Han?

632
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,740
Do you even keep in touch with your brother?

633
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,560
Why isn't he back in the country on his mother's memorial day?

634
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,730
Because it'll be tough to see you, Grandfather.

635
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,070
I heard.

636
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,630
That you knew all about...

637
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,050
Brother and Na A Jeong.

638
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,960
So?

639
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,420
Will you also cut ties with your grandpa?

640
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,630
You were too harsh.

641
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,170
What did Brother do wrong?

642
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,580
Never mind me.

643
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,550
Never mind you?

644
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,130
What did you do wrong?

645
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,550
Sometimes, I think about it.

646
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,820
When and where did it go wrong?

647
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,570
After tracing it back,

648
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,760
it always ends on that day.

649
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,560
The day of the accident.

650
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:51,200
Things would be different if Mother didn't die because of me.

651
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,870
Brother and I both would've been able to have more of an ordinary life.

652
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:02,450
How many times did I tell you your mom didn't die because of you?

653
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,330
That's not true!

654
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,550
You only say that...

655
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,410
because you don't want to talk about that day, Grandfather.

656
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,700
You say that to cover everything up.

657
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,580
You resent me, Grandfather.

658
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,150
Just as everyone knows.

659
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,280
The reason I don't talk about that day is...

660
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,500
not because I resent you or blame you for it.

661
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,300
You know?

662
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,800
It's because...

663
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,250
It's just because...

664
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,670
I can't forgive myself for it.

665
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,810
Because it was all my fault.

666
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,580
I can't forgive myself.

667
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:05,130
When I realized something was wrong,

668
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,070
it was already too late.

669
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:30,160
 Mom. 

670
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,100
 Mom. 

671
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,850
 Ji Han? Ji Han! Ji Han! 

672
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,940
 Mom. 

673
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,310
 Ji Han, don't worry. 

674
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:48,250
 You don't worry about a thing. It's okay. 

675
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,600
   

676
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:03,410
 Why isn't he picking up? Why? 

677
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,910
I think about it every day, just like you.

678
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:23,010
When and where did things go wrong?

679
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,410
 Soo Hyeon! Soo Hyeon! 

680
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,210
 Soo Hyeon! Soo Hyeon! 

681
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,650
 Soo Hyeon. 

682
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,640
 Soo Hyeon! 

683
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,580
 Soo Hyeon, wake up. 

684
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,950
 W-Why? 

685
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,580
 - Dad? 
 - Soo Hyeon! 

686
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,800
 Yes, it's Dad. It's your dad! 

687
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,320
 Yes. 

688
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,200
 Soo Hyeon, I'll get you out. 

689
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
 Huh? What? 

690
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,820
 Ji Han. 

691
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,840
 Ji Han. 

692
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,850
 Ji Han. 

693
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,570
 Ji Han. 

694
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,830
 Ji Han. 

695
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,790
 - Soo Hyeon. 
 - Ji Han. 

696
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,110
Only if I had arrived at the scene a bit earlier.

697
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:10,580
If I hadn't hesitated...

698
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,140
If I had,

699
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,940
I wouldn't have let Soo Hyeon go like that.

700
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:26,910
I... I just live every day regretting like this.

701
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,320
I'm sorry.

702
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,930
I don't know what good this will do at this point.

703
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,640
But there's one thing I don't regret doing.

704
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,160
Saving you that day.

705
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,830
Yes, it's weird for your grandpa to say this when I treated you

706
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:59,400
like you didn't exist and made you lonely all your life.

707
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,510
Yes.

708
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:08,850
Whenever I saw your face, it reminded me of your mom and I'd remember what I did wrong.

709
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:14,020
It was because I just wanted to bury it all somehow.

710
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:20,590
However, even if I were to go back to that day, I'd save you.

711
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,450
It's what your mom wanted as well.

712
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,090
So what happened that day...

713
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,660
was absolutely not your fault.

714
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,620
I'm fine with you cutting ties with me.

715
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,370
But please get out of that day.

716
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:48,130
It's enough that I regret and suffer.

717
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,350
I'll get going.

718
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,620
Take your time and talk with your mom.

719
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,760
You know, Mom...

720
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,690
She was happy.

721
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:22,010
Though it may have been a short moment,

722
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,990
when I think about back then, Mom...

723
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:31,030
I can only remember her smiling.

724
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,000
Is that so?

725
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,570
I'm glad.

726
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,890
Stay out of the rain.

727
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:26,500
   

728
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:03,990


729
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:09,870
♫  A sky filled with clouds, we fly high, get away  ♫

730
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:15,390
♫  In your arms, way high, left away  ♫

731
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,960
♫  As if spring came, the cozy sunlight shines on you  ♫

732
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,450
♫  To you, oh yeah  ♫

733
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:33,240
♫  The wind raises its hands and embraces my cheeks  ♫

734
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:38,540
♫  Shining like it's burning, all the perfect timing  ♫

735
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,380
♫  A scent that fills the air  ♫

736
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:47,570
♫  Over the skyline, dive down past it  ♫

737
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,810
♫  I fly with you  ♫

738
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:53,160
♫  Azure feelings come blowing  ♫

739
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,020
♫  What do we do?  ♫

740
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:59,450
♫  A night filled with dreams  ♫

741
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:02,470
   

742
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,240
 What have you been up to, Na A Jeong? 

743
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,630
 Was your life good without me? 

744
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,570
 I've been doing well. 

745
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,680
 I'm glad you seem to be doing well. 

746
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,820
 A Jeong! 

747
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,680
 You really won't see Ji Han? 

748
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,160
 Work is just an excuse. It's because of A Jeong. Right? 

749
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,510
 Sis had such a hard time because of you. 

750
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,750
 That's A Jeong's boyfriend over there. 

751
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,460
 I'll go for it before I miss you again. 

752
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:32,040
 Because I can't live without you, Na A Jeong. 

753
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:37,270
♫  The wind raises its hands and embraces my cheeks  ♫

754
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,510
♫  Shining like it's burning  ♫
