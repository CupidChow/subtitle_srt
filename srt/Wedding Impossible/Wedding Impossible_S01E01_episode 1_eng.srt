1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,690
   
   

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,900
   
   

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,200
   

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,950
   

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,670
     

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,994
   

7
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:25,814
   

8
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:29,284
   

9
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:35,684
   

10
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:45,100


11
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:50,084
   

12
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:18,804
   

13
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,334
♫  I've never felt this before  ♫

14
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:33,814
♫  Nobody's ever taught me this in my life  ♫

15
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:36,874
♫  My heart feels like it will explode  ♫

16
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:39,514
♫  I can't hold it in anymore  ♫

17
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:43,524
♫  I want to love you and cherish you  ♫

18
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:45,600
♫  I want to live it  ♫

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,900
♫  Even if I were to have the whole world  ♫

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,584
♫  If it is a world without you  ♫

21
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:58,734
♫  It is meaningless  ♫

22
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,684
Kiss!

23
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:06,694
Congratulations!

24
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:10,084
That was a great congratulatory song from the bride's friend of 13 years, So Jin.

25
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:11,334
Next up is—

26
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:14,254
Wait, just a moment.

27
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:19,294
I just had something I wanted to say to my friend.

28
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:26,200
I will be letting go of my position as her best friend as of today.

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I will let you take that position, Oppa.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,044
Oppa, you have to make my Ji Eun happy. Okay?

31
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:39,100
Promise me.

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,000
Promise me.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,700
- Congrats on your wedding. 
 - Thanks.

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,300
Congrats on your wedding!

35
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:57,724
You look so good!

36
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:00,384
Go! I'm filming a video.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,900
I usually only sing up to the first verse,

38
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,564
but I sang the second verse as well, just for you.

39
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:15,644
The music did keep playing,

40
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:17,664
but you two just looked so good together.

41
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,274
Thank you.

42
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:20,634
This is your account, right?

43
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,000
   

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Yes, that is right. But I am leaving without eating,

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
so please include half of the meal cost in my payment.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,700
- Oh... 
 - Yes.

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,500
And how should I send you the photos I took? AirDrop?

48
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,300
My phone is a different kind...

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,084
Oh, then I will send it through the messaging app.

50
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:44,284
By the way, I think you are so good at acting.

51
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:45,800
Really?

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,200
I didn't think you would even tear up.

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,100
Even my husband got touched, saying he didn't know I had a friend who cared for me so much.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,300
He was always worried because I didn't have any friends.

55
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,600
Tell him to be good to you instead of just worrying going forward.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,814
- Sorry? 
 - I mean, think about it.

57
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:04,900
I may be a fake best friend who was paid to come,

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,600
but your husband is for real.

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,894
- Okay. 
 - Seriously, congratulations on your wedding.

60
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:11,534
I really mean it. I'm not acting.

61
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,444
- Was it okay? 
 - You were great, Hyung.

62
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,764
Gosh, where did I put it?

63
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:22,224
You're looking for these, right?

64
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:25,284
You always hold them when you get nervous.

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,800
You aren't even part of my family.

66
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:31,284
Why are you in here like this?

67
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:34,934
Do you think I will sell that land just because you do this?

68
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:38,800
Father, why are you saying such a mean thing to him like that?

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,700
Ji Han is pretty much part of our family.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,500
Do you know how good he has been to our family?

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,900
He even helped out with our strawberry farm last year!

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,114
It was two years ago.

73
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:48,714
Oh, really?

74
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:50,900
And when you hurt your lower back, Father,

75
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,500
Ji Han took you to the hospital and took care of you!

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,924
You think he did all that without any ulterior motives?

77
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,944
It's because he wants something out of me!

78
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,304
Maybe I shouldn't have come here.

80
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:10,300
Hyung, I'll be outside.

81
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Father!

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,500
Geez!

83
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,400
Let's sell this land now.

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Hey, seriously you—

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
Forget it. Don't be like that.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,400
Ji Han, you step aside.

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,764
Father, if we'd just sold this land, Mother wouldn't have suffered so much.

88
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:26,854
Hyung...

89
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:29,374
If we don't sell this land right now,

90
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:31,054
I won't see you again, Father.

91
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:33,464
Are you okay with that?

92
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,600
Is this some new form of apology?

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,174
You should be the one to apologize.

94
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:20,464
I didn't step on yours. You stepped on mine.

95
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:23,500
I don't know how expensive those are,

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,900
but mine is incomparably more expensive than your scraps of paper.

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,334
This would be much more.

98
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,314
   

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Really?

100
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,034
Then I guess I should apologize.

101
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Here. I'm sorry.

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,700
Let's just say we're even.

103
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,800
What's with that girl?

104
00:06:57,614 --> 00:06:59,444
Lee Do Han!

105
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,800
You're coming to South Korea? All of a sudden?

106
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,500
You're coming, Hyung? What is your schedule?

107
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:16,654
   

108
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:46,534
Pardon me for a moment, sir.

109
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,454
Yoon Chae Won!

110
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,534
Hi. Sit down.

111
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,894
Gosh, what is this?

112
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:01,814
What happened? When did you come to New York?

113
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,364
It looks like we're about to get married.

114
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,214
You see that guy to the diagonal of us?

115
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:08,414
He is a reporter.

116
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:11,114
Once our company launches our new brand promotion,

117
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,984
there will be a dating scandal article involving you and me.

118
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,800
Were you responsible for that photo?

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Did you have someone follow me in New York?

120
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,100
Do Han, you must be mistaking something,

121
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,104
but I didn't bring that reporter with me.

122
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,700
Ji Han put him on me.

123
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Your grandfather is already sold on the idea, and my father is also making a fuss now.

124
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,800
Trying to hook us up together.

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,054
What else could it be but a project to remove his divorced daughter's flaw.

126
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:38,734
And my younger brother started a project of selling out his brother.

127
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:42,700
If one of you were to be sold in marriage, I'd prefer your younger brother.

128
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,400
What?

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,000
If I had to choose one of you, your younger brother is more my type.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Ji Han is cute.

131
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,904
Yeah, show him as much affection as you want.

132
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,374
Even better if you took him to your house.

133
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:56,200
What will you do now, Lee Do Han?

134
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,100
It looks like we may really get married this time.

135
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:11,334
Hello.

136
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,300
Why are you out here again? It's cold?

137
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,400
You came.

138
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Grandma, sell me all of these jujubes.

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,400
All of this?

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,894
Gosh, I am always grateful to you. What should I do?

141
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,314
Gosh, I am more grateful for selling me tasty jujubes.

142
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,044
- I heard it'll get really cold today. Head home early. 
 - Yeah.

143
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:30,974
- Okay, all right. 
 - Okay?

144
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:33,664
The fact that not only hotels

145
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,884
but also scientific facilities are built together

146
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:40,500
is one of our strategies that completely differentiates existing competitive stores in the region.

147
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,600
Not only that, it also includes a total indoor sports theme park,

148
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,374
a premium multiplex movie theater, and a new concept aquarium.

149
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:52,554
I believe it's only a matter of time before this shopping mall in Myeongju becomes a regional landmark.

150
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:57,364
The new shopping mall in Myeongju City wasn't suspended for fear of being well-accepted.

151
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,800
There are holdouts dispersed on that land

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,900
that need to be removed before we can even start construction.

153
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,954
Does that mean you are saying

154
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,400
if we just remove the holdouts,

155
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,200
you'll let us proceed with the construction?

156
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:23,154
Allow us to proceed with it, then. We took care of it.

157
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:31,884
   

158
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,844
- Hyeok Soo, please take care of the cleanup. 
 - Okay.

159
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,294
- Goodbye. 
 - Great work.

160
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:53,554
Why aren't you following me out, Deputy Lee Ji Han? I'm working offsite.

161
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:57,354
It is such an easy situation, but you can't seem to read the room...

162
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,154
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,100
Everyone, work hard.

164
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:08,714
He took care of the holdouts,

165
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:12,444
and yet our team leader keeps dragging Ji Han around like a servant.

166
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:15,774
I know. If I were him, I'd be so proud of him that I'd carry him on my back.

167
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:19,544
Also, the Team Leader will receive a special promotion if this new shopping mall goes through.

168
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:23,594
Who knows? Maybe Ji Han is volunteering to be his servant to get his favor.

169
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:25,524
- What? 
 - What?

170
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:30,014
 I mean, there is that rumor. 

171
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:34,564
 That our team leader is the secret grandson of the chairman. 

172
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,614
Deputy Lee Ji Han...

173
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,614
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:52,094
Ji Han, you were amazing this time, too.

175
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:56,614
You took care of those difficult holdouts like nothing!

176
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,324
   

177
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:02,044
Well, so what?

178
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,044
   

179
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:05,184
    
 Trustworthy sworn brother,

180
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,734
reliable young man, Deputy Lee.

181
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:11,374
No matter how well I act, Grandfather doesn't even acknowledge it.

182
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,714
But still, the news about you is widespread in our company.

183
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:26,304
Your good reputation will soon reach the ears of the chairman like a round song.

184
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:29,234
Maybe he's heard it already. So...

185
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:34,024
I heard Attorney Hwang went to meet the chairman just now

186
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:36,734
to do final revisions for his will.

187
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,174
Are you serious?

188
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,944
Is that why he also suddenly called Brother?

189
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:44,874
I think you can really look forward to it this time.

190
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:50,604
He should have arrived by now.

191
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:55,514
Lee Do Han!

192
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:57,264
Hey!

193
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:59,504
What is this!

194
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:02,374
Hey, how come you look perfectly fine?

195
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:04,984
It was a 14-hour flight.

196
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,874
You don't stink at all.

197
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,914
And you look great as usual.

198
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,604
You said you couldn't come out because you were busy, so I called a taxi.

199
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:14,064
I was busy and almost didn't make it.

200
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:18,524
But I managed to take some time out of my busy work schedule.

201
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:23,034
Why? Because my best friend of 15 years is coming to South Korea in five years.

202
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:26,134
- Whoa, I'm touched. 
 - Let's go.

203
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:28,754
What? You have a car? Since when?

204
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:31,054
Since I was born?

205
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:34,564
 Wasn't it hard coming here? 

206
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,834
 It wasn't so bad. 

207
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,394
What is this?

208
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:46,844
Who is this?

209
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,364
Who are you referring to?

210
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,384
A woman.

211
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:54,034
A woman laughing with Brother.

212
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:04,334
   

213
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,214
As expected of Na A Jeong, you've still got it.

214
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:11,044
Just five years ago, you were crying and whining, wanting to quit acting.

215
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:15,124
Congratulations! I told you you'd be successful.

216
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:19,344
If you really want to congratulate me, forget about last season's ending.

217
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:22,204
Season 2 started today.

218
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:23,784
Oh, yeah, talk to me.

219
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:26,874
When is the drama you're starring in going to air?

220
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,384
Drama?

221
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,174
Enough about me. Tell me what's going on with you.

222
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:34,334
Why did you come back out of the blue? And for a whole month at that?

223
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,884
I'm here briefly since I heard Grandfather isn't feeling well.

224
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:39,334
What?

225
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,634
Didn't you say he wasn't well last time, too?

226
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:44,084
Is he really unwell this time?

227
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,844
No. I feel like I've been baited by his fake illness.

228
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:53,904
Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever heard about your family.

229
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:01,334
 The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office's Joint Investigation Headquarters for Financial Securities Crimes announced 

230
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:06,354
 the indictment of Chae Min Woong, executive director of LJ Hotel, on charges of stock price manipulation. 

231
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:10,044
Grandfather, please don't be angry.

232
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:13,774
He was only trying to do his best.

233
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:16,284
He kept talking about how he wanted to expand

234
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:20,274
his business quickly and be of help to you, Grandfather!

235
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:23,684
Miss, have you talked with the legal team?

236
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:28,644
The prosecutor's evidence alone won't be enough to prove unrealized profit.

237
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:31,484
It will probably end with a probation, Grandfather.

238
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:35,074
If you think about it, it really wasn't fake news, either.

239
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:38,894
China was definitely sending positive signals for an exclusive contract, too.

240
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:44,844
But I don't know what they heard from whom, and everything got overturned.

241
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:56,264
I'm sorry I am late, Grandfather.

242
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,014
I want to grab some coffee with you,

243
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:10,874
but they're not giving me a chance to. They keep calling me.

244
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:12,524
Thanks.

245
00:16:12,524 --> 00:16:14,234
- Hurry up and go. 
 - Okay.

246
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,664
Let's eat our soul food, banquet noodles, later when you're free.

247
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,884
- Okay. 
 - Really, thanks.

248
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:20,384
- Bye now. 
 - Okay, be safe.

249
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:21,644
Sorry.

250
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:23,864
- Drive safely. 
 - Okay, I'm leaving!

251
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,554
See you!

252
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,174
Hey, did I forget something in the car?

253
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,614
 Oh, it's not that. 

254
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:42,104
You didn't leave anything, but I did.

255
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:43,314
Check your pocket.

256
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,144
My pocket?

257
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,594
Just a moment.

258
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,674
 If you wait for me to be free, 

259
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,064
you may never taste banquet noodles.

260
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,854
You go ahead and eat it first.

261
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,914
Go to a cafe and get some coffee,

262
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,354
and go to a sauna and scrub dead skin off, too.

263
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,184
You know you have to go to a sauna when you come to South Korea, right?

264
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,564
- Hey, Na A Jeong, you— 
  - Hey, Lee Do Han. 

265
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,314
You said this to me before

266
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:12,114
that it is better to give than to receive.

267
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,414
You said that's what friends are for.

268
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,594
- Did I say that? 
 - Anyway, enjoy the food,

269
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:20,364
and make sure to send me a photo as proof.

270
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,934
I'll hang up now since I'm busy.

271
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:33,560
Yeah, I'm almost there.

272
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,834
You said you'd be here by three!

273
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,664
I was dying because of you, Unni!

274
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,614
- I got delayed because of traffic. 
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

275
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,984
Is he very angry?

276
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,144
The Slave 3 wore your costume.

277
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:59,564
Ji Hye took it off of her, and I ran off with it.

278
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:02,404
It's the fairy and the woodcutter. I'll change into the fairy.

279
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,734
- Let me ask you for a favor. 
 - What?

280
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:07,594
Buy me a coffee. You know how I like it, right?

281
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,094
Please get it for me. I'll be going then!

282
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,034
Who asked you to do it?

283
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,944
I am unfairly accused!

284
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:17,224
Twist their legs until they confess their sins!

285
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,174
 Yes, sir! 

286
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,274
Cut! Okay.

287
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,894
Cut! We got an okay!

288
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:46,884
It is a cafe latte.

289
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,894
No syrup, nonfat, with sugar added.

290
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:52,424
It's how you like it.

291
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:56,294
Gosh, seriously.

292
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,314
Geez, I already found another extra, so there is no use.

293
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:04,444
Gosh, please just let me off this once! I was never late before.

294
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:08,164
If I let you off this once, I have to let all 15 of them off, too. I don't want to do that.

295
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:10,004
I was never late before, though!

296
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:12,134
- You're always like this! I don't want to. 
 - Just this once, seriously!

297
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,554
Hey, what are you doing here? We're in deep trouble! Hurry up and come!

298
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,574
- Yes, got it. 
 - Let's talk for just a bit.

299
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:17,994
Gosh, why are you like this?

300
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:19,734
I'm busy, so stop talking about this.

301
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,824
She's always like this.

302
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,754
Coming, I'm coming!

303
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:25,814
Gosh, this is so annoying.

304
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,004
I know the horses can be scary, too.

305
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,954
But you rode it just fine up until yesterday!

306
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:33,424
You said you can do it!

307
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:35,724
You bragged about it so much on variety shows.

308
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,634
How could you do this here?

309
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,014
Director, my Na Rae says she wants to ride it, too.

310
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,574
But she suddenly developed a trauma.

311
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:44,964
How could she develop a trauma overnight?

312
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,964
Did you fall off a horse? Are you okay?

313
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,444
W-Well, that isn't it.

314
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:53,744
She says she almost got her hand bitten while giving the horse a carrot.

315
00:19:57,144 --> 00:20:00,214
How can I reset the filming schedule?

316
00:20:00,214 --> 00:20:02,444
Hey! What happened to the double?

317
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:07,504
She got into an accident on her way here, so she may be late...

318
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:10,184
I guess we'll film it after the sun's gone down!

319
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,934
Excuse me.

320
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,824
I'll do it.

321
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,034
I know how to ride a horse.

322
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:28,604
She's good.

323
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,254
When did she learn how to ride a horse?

324
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:32,704
She supposedly learned it just in case.

325
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,214
She looks familiar.

326
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:36,774
Wasn't she the one who was part of the underwater filming last time?

327
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:40,174
Yes, she has a scuba diving license, and she got it just in case, too.

328
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:43,534
She's learned a lot of things, just in case.

329
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,624
- Cut. 
 - Okay. Cut! Please come back.

330
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:52,804
It's just this time.

331
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,014
Okay.

332
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:56,644
Let's prepare for the next scene!

333
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:05,144
As usual, there is no one like Na A Jeong to turn someone around.

334
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,194
Unni.

335
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:08,674
Thanks a lot.

336
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:12,124
It drove on dirt roads like a flowery road.

337
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:13,524
Jong Hee, thanks.

338
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:17,424
I carried it around carefully like it was one of my organs.

339
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:21,624
Having to act in front of the director and your friend...

340
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:23,824
You are so busy today, A Jeong.

341
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,914
I know.

342
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:28,294
Unni, I had no idea I was that good at impromptu acting.

343
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,454
You know how nervous I was when I left.

344
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:34,194
But as soon as I saw Lee Do Han's face, my lines just started coming out.

345
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,474
Someone like you should get the lead role.

346
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:40,764
How long did we have to wait on standby because of that Hong Na Ri's terrible acting?

347
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:42,794
But you said he's your best friend, A Jeong.

348
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:44,334
Why would you lie to him?

349
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,954
It isn't lying. It's acting.

350
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:48,784
I mean, taking extra roles because you haven't gotten famous yet isn't a flaw.

351
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:52,744
If you told him honestly, you wouldn't have to go through all of this.

352
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:57,464
Hey, MZ generation friend. You haven't done anything embarrassing in front of your friends, right?

353
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:01,244
Don't drink with your friends.

354
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:03,704
Even if you do, don't get drunk.

355
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,514
But if you did drink and got drunk,

356
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:07,574
then don't ever hit anyone.

357
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:11,404
 So, you're saying you got hit? 

358
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:15,184
 How many times must I tell you? 

359
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:18,234
 That woman got wasted and totally beat us up! 

360
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:20,724
 - Look at my face! 
 - No. 

361
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:24,454
 You guys tried to scam me first and film something weird! 

362
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:26,494
 You said it was a low-budget indie film! 

363
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:30,854
 You said it was an 8-minute one-take film you would submit to a film festival! 

364
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:36,294
 Is an 8-minute porn filmed on a cheap motel bed an indie film for you? 

365
00:22:36,294 --> 00:22:37,784
 I want her punished. 

366
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,484
 Lock her up in jail! 

367
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,964
 You should be the one to be locked up! 

368
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,154
 A Jeong! A Jeong, hold yourself back. 

369
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,424
 You should be locked up! 

370
00:22:45,424 --> 00:22:49,004
 Hey, hey, hey! Please be quiet! 

371
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,794
 So basically, 

372
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:54,814
 the two of them in there suddenly came drunk 

373
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:58,744
 to the motel where the three of you were. 

374
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,704
 And the two of them unilaterally assaulted you guys together? 

375
00:23:01,704 --> 00:23:05,244
 No, not together, but that girl by herself! 

376
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:06,714
 By herself? 

377
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:10,574
 Her specialty is martial arts. 

378
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:13,614
 I learned it just in case. 

379
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:15,924
 Just in case. 

380
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:23,604
 Seriously... 

381
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:26,004
 What did I do wrong! 

382
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,364
 You didn't do anything wrong. 

383
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:31,964
 I'm thinking of giving up on acting. 

384
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:34,614
 Hey, why should they have an effect on your life? 

385
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,814
 You've done well up to now. 

386
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:39,124
 They say an opportunity is bald at the back of its head. 

387
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:42,704
 So once it passes, you can't take hold of it again. 

388
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,714
 But for me, it feels like it's bald, even at the front of its head. 

389
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:48,974
 I just can't get ahold of it. 

390
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:52,584
 I really thought this one was a good opportunity. 

391
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:59,794
 Don't cry, A Jeong. 

392
00:23:59,794 --> 00:24:03,064
 A good opportunity will come to you for sure! 

393
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,554
But that opportunity still hasn't come

394
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:10,524
and I am still here like this.

395
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:13,874
It's just so embarrassing!

396
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:17,964
He is living a cool life, being acknowledged for his work in New York.

397
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:20,434
But I'm still like this...

398
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:22,544
That was a bit sad for me.

399
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:28,094
How my close friends and I start living in different worlds.

400
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:31,564
There was a time when we used to live in the same world.

401
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,854
Anyway, he'll return to New York in a month,

402
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:39,514
and when he gets busy with his work, he'll forget all about my drama.

403
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:44,744
I just want to show him a good side of me while he is here.

404
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:48,604
I don't want him to feel bad whenever he thinks about me like in the past.

405
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:51,014
Gosh, why would you say that?

406
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,434
It's so good to see how hard you work.

407
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,254
Really?

408
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,964
- But I— 
 - Unni!

409
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:01,084
A Jeong!

410
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,404
Unni!

411
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:06,444
Unni, Unni! A Jeong!

412
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:08,344
You went through so much!

413
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:10,974
Thank you so much for riding the horse in my place.

414
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:13,864
No, I benefited, thanks to you.

415
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:16,364
You're so sweet.

416
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:22,584
I should've stayed in the horseback riding club while I was in school, just like you, Unni.

417
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:26,314
Even if you can't ride horses, you keep getting lead roles like this.

418
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:28,784
Unni, you get extra roles, too.

419
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:33,804
Isn't that right? We've met in so many dramas, right?

420
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,974
You're right. I keep ending up meeting you in dramas.

421
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:42,484
In any case, it is so nice to meet you on set like this all the time, right?

422
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:43,994
Let's grab dinner sometime.

423
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:46,354
Check my schedule with my manager and set it up.

424
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,924
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

425
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:50,244
Let's eat together. Sure.

426
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,814
Sounds good.

427
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:54,174
- Go, go. 
 - Okay, go home and rest.

428
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:55,964
See you. Great work.

429
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:57,174
Goodbye!

430
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:59,154
Goodbye!

431
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,784
Na Ri!

432
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:05,204
It was so good!

433
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:09,964
Wow. Well, this doesn't feel all that great.

434
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:12,114
You said Hong Na Ri was your college classmate, right?

435
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:13,344
Yeah.

436
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,994
Back then, A Jeong was way more popular.

437
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:20,994
That gaenari is doing that on purpose to screw with A Jeong. 
  (Slang substitute for a profanity) 

438
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:22,744
I'm fine.

439
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:23,854
Let's go, let's go.

440
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:25,654
Let's go.

441
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:40,964
Brother, you should ask him yourself.

442
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:45,114
You were worried about Grandfather's health all the way here.

443
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:48,084
- I did? 
 - Yeah, you did, Brother.

444
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:49,934
Come on.

445
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:52,994
Don't say stuff you don't mean.

446
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:59,984
I, your grandfather, met with Attorney Hwang and revised my will.

447
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:03,554
It will go through notarization right away.

448
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:07,744
Let me say this while everyone is here, so there is no side talk.

449
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,534
Do Han.

450
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:16,404
Hurry up and marry Taeyang Group's Chae Won.

451
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:18,414
If you two get married,

452
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:22,574
I will pass on the management rights to you.

453
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,964
 - Grandfather, you can't do that!  
 - Quiet!

454
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:30,744
Do you know what I am proud of after leading this company

455
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:33,484
by myself all the way to this age?

456
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:37,704
I've never had to stand in a photo line for the Prosecutors' Office.

457
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:42,044
But my grandchildren manipulated stock prices,

458
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:45,164
caused a stir for power tripping at a department store, and you...

459
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,704
got your driver's license suspended for DUI.

460
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:52,774
I mean, who else in this household is proper aside from these two?

461
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:55,644
But still...

462
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:59,094
he's been overseas for five years. He knows nothing about management.

463
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,344
And how will you persuade the shareholders?

464
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:02,584
It will be difficult.

465
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:05,654
That is why I am telling him to marry Chae Won.

466
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,044
She is the daughter of Taeyang Group.

467
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:11,394
Who would dare antagonize Taeyang Group's son-in-law?

468
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:15,254
Also, this marriage talk is nothing new.

469
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:17,584
It should've happened five years ago.

470
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:21,304
Whatever the reason, you two should get married quickly.

471
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:25,884
I will assume that and will declare officially

472
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:29,144
my succession plans at my upcoming birthday banquet.

473
00:28:29,144 --> 00:28:31,174
Chae Won and I have...

474
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:35,004
already finished talking about that.

475
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,974
Finished what?

476
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,834
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,034
We don't have any feelings for each other.

478
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:44,134
- We won't get married. 
 - What are you saying?

479
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:02,944
How could you tell him you won't?

480
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:05,974
What are you? A middle schooler going through puberty?

481
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,444
You are 32 years old. Thirty two.

482
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:11,744
Why are you being rebellious at an old age and stressing me out?

483
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,164
Choi Min Woong. Choi Seung Ah.

484
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:17,794
Do you know how hard I worked so I don't end up on Grandfather's bad side like them?

485
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:20,014
While the Chois got draft immunity through dual citizenships, 
    

486
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:22,164
I voluntarily joined the Marines.

487
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:24,014
 Victory! 

488
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,164
And while the Chois gained positions through nepotism,

489
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:30,584
I got hired through open recruitment and worked my way up from the bottom.

490
00:29:31,314 --> 00:29:34,954
Also, while the Chois were attending luxury brand events,

491
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:37,324
I attended environmental group events.

492
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:42,384
I literally went to clean up garbage to get rid of those pieces of trash! You know that?

493
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:47,464
Mr. Lee, I don't like carrots. Leave them out.

494
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:48,784
Is the company like this carrot?

495
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:51,224
You eat it if you like it, and don't if you don't like it?

496
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:57,754
Hurry up and apologize to Grandfather. Say you misspoke.

497
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,754
No, then I have to get married.

498
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:03,274
Just get married. He says he will pass on the company to you.

499
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:05,284
Why don't you like CEO Yoon anyway?

500
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,744
Well, because I don't want to get married.

501
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:09,254
So, why don't you want to get married?

502
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,454
Because it's Chae Won.

503
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,964
So why don't you like CEO Yoon—

504
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:17,214
- Are you messing with me? 
 - How could I marry someone I don't even love?

505
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:19,154
What are you, a little kid? Why are you so insistent?

506
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:22,474
Brother, your feelings could gradually develop, but

507
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:24,274
if you pass up on the company's management rights, that's it.

508
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:28,744
If it's that easy, you can just marry Chae Won and inherit the company.

509
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,624
Right, Terry? Right? Goodness. Right, Terry?

510
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,904
Grandfather won't give me that position.

511
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:37,274
He's giving it to you because it's you, Brother.

512
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:39,684
Don't make me say it when you know everything.

513
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:42,134
- Hey, Lee Ji Han... 
 - So make sure you accept it.

514
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,534
I'll handle the hard stuff. You do the easy stuff.

515
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:45,704
Gosh, that looks good.

516
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:49,594
I'm doing my best not to be a detriment to you.

517
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:55,604
Brother, a soccer team with Messi is different,

518
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,904
and a volleyball team with Kim Yeon Koung is different.

519
00:30:57,904 --> 00:31:00,554
For management, a team with Yoon Chae Won will be different.

520
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:03,244
Your cooking got a lot better while I've been away.

521
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:05,764
So, just eat everything I prepare for you.

522
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,564
Gosh, all these cars we don't even ride...

523
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:09,254
We should just sell them all.

524
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:10,964
Why? They look nice.

525
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:14,354
Brother, do you have a honeypot hidden in New York?

526
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:15,424
Honeypot?

527
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:18,344
I'm asking if you have some hidden lover there.

528
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:26,464
You do, don't you?

529
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,494
That's why you're giving it all up, right?

530
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,084
Is it that woman?

531
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:31,824
A woman?

532
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:36,154
The woman you were with at the airport.

533
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:41,284
Did you have that reporter follow me?

534
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:46,194
I had him follow CEO Yoon, not you.

535
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:47,704
Hey, Lee Ji Han.

536
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:50,864
By chance, did you hire someone to follow me even in New York?

537
00:31:50,864 --> 00:31:55,024
Brother, you never gave me your New York address.

538
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:57,704
I trust you, but you don't trust me, Brother.

539
00:31:57,704 --> 00:32:01,544
So, you were hiding so much because of this woman, right?

540
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,524
Fine, she is my lover. What will you do about it?

541
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,274
What? She really is?

542
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:10,904
Yeah, so don't tell me to marry someone else. Okay?

543
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,914
Get home safely.

544
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:27,954
But why didn't A Jeong come?

545
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:29,184
She was busy with work.

546
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,904
Oh, she's filming a drama?

547
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:36,354
Why is she so busy when she only appears on screen for a split second?

548
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,934
Her set location is far away.

549
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:42,124
So we almost never get to see her face, either. Isn't that right?

550
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:43,394
That's not true.

551
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,814
I see Auntie all the time.

552
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:49,084
I watched Running Man with her just yesterday.

553
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:52,864
He really likes Sister. Right?

554
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:57,184
Tell her to show her face on days we all get together like this, no matter how busy she is.

555
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,984
All you do is tell her to go on blind dates when she does come.

556
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:01,594
Brother, goodness.

557
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:03,364
If her career isn't working out,

558
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:06,954
it's better to find a handsome guy and get married while she's still young.

559
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:09,514
Am I saying this for my benefit?

560
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:14,384
I'm out of egg wash. Let me bring some more.

561
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:15,954
Mom, please get me a glass of water.

562
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,964
Sis, I'll take some juice.

563
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:20,364
There may be children who refuse to go to ancestral rites,

564
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:24,924
but no parents tell their child not to come when she says she'll come.

565
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:28,354
Why didn't you take me with you?

566
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,324
How could you go without telling me?

567
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:31,734
Are you embarrassed of me?

568
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:35,014
At this rate, why not just remove me from the family registry?

569
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,014
Seriously, who is it?

570
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:40,994
Who always eats my ice cream without restocking it?

571
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:45,074
Honey.

572
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:47,874
Should we send A Jeong on a blind date?

573
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:49,454
What's with you?

574
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:52,924
You said you would support her as much as you can.

575
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:55,644
That was 10 years ago! Even rivers and mountains change in 10 years.

576
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:57,824
How could I feel the same way?

577
00:33:57,824 --> 00:34:00,414
You are all making a mistake on an unscratched lottery ticket.

578
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,824
I will never forget this miserable feeling.

579
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:07,094
Goodness, please do so.

580
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:10,174
Please come this way, CEO.

581
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:15,874
How could he have a secret girlfriend?

582
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:17,054
I know, right?

583
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,784
It is my first time hearing Lee Do Han is dating someone.

584
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:22,384
From what I found out, I think she's a high school classmate.

585
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:24,424
She's an actress right now, but nothing comes up when I search online.

586
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:26,174
They seemed to get along.

587
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:28,164
So, give up, Ji Han.

588
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,664
So, Do Han can breathe a little.

589
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:31,434
What are you saying? This is only the beginning.

590
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:35,144
In any case, don't you worry, CEO Yoon. I will take care of this.

591
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:39,114
Ji Han, I'm really not interested in getting married.

592
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:40,754
I failed once, too.

593
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:45,164
CEO Yoon, you're a really good person.

594
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:47,944
But my brother is also a good guy. Just give him a chance.

595
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:50,824
He'll care for you more than yourself.

596
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:53,954
What about you?

597
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:57,274
Why bother asking? I already care about you.

598
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:05,034
Lee Do Han, you dared kick aside a blessing that came to you on its own?

599
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,244
I will help you put it in the goalpost.

600
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:09,364
 Action! 

601
00:35:11,024 --> 00:35:12,244
Search everywhere!

602
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,054
 Yes, sir! 

603
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:21,534
It's still a long way to go.

604
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:24,774
Gosh, you scared me!

605
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:28,224
Who are you?

606
00:35:28,224 --> 00:35:30,264
Do you know an actress named Na A Jeong?

607
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,284
A Jeong?

608
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:52,994
 Oh, that sounds so good. 

609
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:56,284
 - It's so good. 
 - Hey. 

610
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,994
 I heard he's gay. 

611
00:35:57,994 --> 00:36:01,724
 The Class 3 president saw him and another guy kissing in the art room. 

612
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,354
 Isn't that the Class 6 president? 

613
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:04,914
 Goodness. 

614
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:08,464
 I thought he was attractive since he's handsome. What a turn-off. 

615
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:11,334
 Why? I like him even more now. 

616
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:15,514
 - You must be crazy! 
 - He's still so cute, though. 

617
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:25,824
 You guys know my dream is to become an actress, right? 

618
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:28,674
 That's why you don't do night study hall and go to acting school. 

619
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:30,104
 That's right. 

620
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,394
 My acting instructor told me this. 

621
00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:34,834
 That I should always behave wherever I am. 

622
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:39,594
 It's a very thin line between your present becoming a moving story or a shameful history. 

623
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:42,294
 You guys should be honored 

624
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:45,614
 because you will be the first shameful history of a future amazing actress. 

625
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,774
 Hey, did you see it yourself? 

626
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,444
 You didn't even see it! Why talk about someone else so rashly? 

627
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,354
 You come here, too! 

628
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,664
 Hey, what does it matter to you whether we talk about someone else or not? 

629
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:05,154
 Why doesn't it matter? 

630
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,864
 He's currently dating me. 

631
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:08,674
 - Wow, amazing. 
 - Goodness. 

632
00:37:08,674 --> 00:37:10,764
 Is it true or not? 

633
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,664
 I'm not Kim Bo Seong. 
 (Famous Korean actor) 

634
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:26,124
 I don't have loyalty or anything like that. 

635
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,254
 Then why did you help me? 

636
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:33,454
 So you can be grateful to me. 

637
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:36,364
 When I become famous later, post a moving story 

638
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:39,524
 about me online because you are grateful to me. 

639
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:44,204
 How I was a really good friend who saved a friend from a difficult situation. 

640
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:46,574
 In any case, I helped you with a motive. 

641
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:50,984
 So, just say thanks at a time like this. 

642
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,394
 Thanks. 

643
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,474
 Did you see their faces? 

644
00:37:54,474 --> 00:37:56,834
 They seemed to be fooled. 

645
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,814
 Why am I so good at acting in situations like this, too? 

646
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:02,344
 Don't you think I'll be good in action films later? 

647
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:09,624
 Okay! Okay! You're good, you're good! Okay, got it. 

648
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:32,524
- Yeah. 
  - What's going on? 

649
00:38:32,524 --> 00:38:35,604
Why did your younger brother come to see me?

650
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,144
 How am I your lover? 

651
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:44,644
Didn't we wrap that up when we graduated from high school?

652
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:47,484
Oh, I'm sorry. There was a misunderstanding,

653
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:49,684
but I didn't know he would go all the way there.

654
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:52,304
Just say a few things and send him back.

655
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,224
I'll explain everything in detail when we meet.

656
00:38:54,224 --> 00:38:56,904
 - Sorry  
 - Hang up for now.

657
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:11,054
I am looking for someone who knows Lee Do Han.

658
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:13,484
Are you sure the person you know is also Lee Do Han?

659
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,004
You sure it's not Kim Do Han or Park Do Han?

660
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:18,094
The person I know is Lee Do Han.

661
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,114
Does the coffee taste bad?

662
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,654
No. It's fine.

663
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:30,364
Right. Your face wouldn't look like that because the coffee tastes bad.

664
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:32,874
Is it because of me?

665
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:34,084
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:36,554
It's my first time meeting someone my brother is dating.

667
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:41,134
It's okay. This is the first time I'm meeting Do Han's younger brother, too.

668
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,344
She never fails to come up with a response.

669
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:47,264
So, Younger Brother, why did you come to see me?

670
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:51,534
What do you want to say that you came all the way to my workplace?

671
00:39:56,014 --> 00:39:58,104
Do you love my brother?

672
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:04,624
Oh, I'm sorry.

673
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:07,554
Oh, I'm sorry.

674
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:08,944
Oh, no.

675
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:10,414
I'm really sorry.

676
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:13,974
I only got to see this in other people's scripts.

677
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:16,704
I never thought I'd hear this in real life.

678
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:18,374
I'm sorry.

679
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,394
Do Han...

680
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:22,434
I do love him.

681
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:25,214
I would be dating him because I love him, right?

682
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:29,574
- I do like him a lot. 
 - I'll get straight to the point.

683
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:31,554
Just like the coffee you spat out,

684
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,204
can't you just spit out my brother, too?

685
00:40:34,204 --> 00:40:37,384
I don't usually spit out coffee like this.

686
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:40,524
I spat it out only because I was so stunned. Stunned...

687
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,354
Then let me stun you one more time.

688
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:45,874
My brother...

689
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:48,364
has someone he will be marrying.

690
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:52,124
Amazing.

691
00:40:52,124 --> 00:40:55,054
Is it like an arranged marriage or something?

692
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,814
Lee Do Han, that bastard...

693
00:40:57,814 --> 00:41:00,334
This is quite interesting...

694
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:08,454
Oh, but Lee Do Han can't have anything like that...

695
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:10,704
Typically, in a situation like this, he shouldn't have you.

696
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:13,474
In a typical situation, you shouldn't be here, either.

697
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:15,704
Isn't this typically a line from the mother-in-law?

698
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,414
Who cares who says it?

699
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:20,474
The important thing is to deliver the message clearly.

700
00:41:20,474 --> 00:41:24,774
In any case, if we were to summarize what's going on...

701
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:30,734
Do Han doesn't want to get married, but your family does, right?

702
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,404
The situation is a lot more serious than I thought.

703
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:36,764
I was going to say I'll break up with him and have you pay for coffee to call it even.

704
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,404
Call it even?

705
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:42,114
You would call it even by trading my brother for this coffee?

706
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:47,164
Okay. If it's a situation like that, I can't break up with him all the more.

707
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:49,344
I won't break up with him.

708
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,934
Also,

709
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,674
don't you watch any dramas?

710
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:02,424
Usually, in a situation like this,

711
00:42:02,424 --> 00:42:06,224
you're supposed to bring a money envelope to find a point of negotiation.

712
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,034
You lack so much prep.

713
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,594
Money envelope.

714
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,184
Na A Jeong.

715
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:32,464
If you will break up with my brother,

716
00:42:32,464 --> 00:42:35,624
I can pay you an appropriate amount of compensation money.

717
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:38,764
I never said I would accept it,

718
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,014
but if you were to do so, could you give me 2 billion won?

719
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:43,674
2 billion won?

720
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,294
You're testing me when you won't even accept it, right?

721
00:42:46,294 --> 00:42:47,914
You're the one testing me.

722
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:50,724
The reason you chose to meet me, though you could've just called.

723
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:54,294
You were going to just watch me if I seemed okay.

724
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:56,354
Isn't that right?

725
00:42:57,794 --> 00:43:01,044
This is a very offensive situation for me right now.

726
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:04,374
 Really? Then I guess I should apologize. 

727
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:09,024
But I'm saying I'll let it go once.

728
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:12,204
Why? Because you are my best friend's younger brother.

729
00:43:12,204 --> 00:43:14,274
Since you came all the way here, this is a gift.

730
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:16,334
Go on home now.

731
00:43:25,114 --> 00:43:26,814
 I'm sorry. 

732
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:30,544
That woman was that girl from then?

733
00:43:32,134 --> 00:43:35,224
Gosh, I really didn't want to have to do this.

734
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:36,994
Hey.

735
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:40,824
Someone, please help me!

736
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:44,394
- What's wrong? 
 - He's a stalker, a stalker!

737
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:47,684
- He kept following me, saying he was a fan. 
 - A fan?

738
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:49,074
When did I say I was your fan?

739
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:52,604
This is a filming set, so the general public cannot be here. Please leave.

740
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:54,784
- No, sir, that's not it, I was just— 
 - I told you to just leave.

741
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:57,374
If you don't leave, I will call security.

742
00:43:58,054 --> 00:43:59,984
Let's go.

743
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:01,154
- Are you all right? 
- Yes.

744
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:03,364
I'm sorry about this.

745
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,924
A Jeong, please just do it one more time.

746
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:13,314
Why am I riding the horse again?

747
00:44:13,314 --> 00:44:15,104
Seriously, aren't you going to hire a double?

748
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:17,904
Actress Na Ri says she likes you doing it since your movements are similar to hers.

749
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,644
It's not like you are paying me more for this.

750
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:22,824
I let you off once, so let me off once, A Jeong.

751
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:24,764
This is our last horseback riding scene, anyway.

752
00:44:24,764 --> 00:44:26,774
- We'll start when you're ready. 
 - Okay.

753
00:44:26,774 --> 00:44:29,314
We're going to start shooting!

754
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:32,574
- A Jeong. 
 - Yeah?

755
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:36,294
Who is that, and why is he staring at you like that?

756
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:38,734
I don't know.

757
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:40,934
Just ignore him.

758
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:43,374
We're going to start shooting!

759
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:48,294
All right, ready! Action!

760
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:55,134
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

761
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:01,414
Her face is...

762
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:03,254
Really?

763
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:05,934
Cut! Let's do that again!

764
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:09,704
Pay attention to your posture on the horse, and don't turn your head too much.

765
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:11,534
Okay!

766
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:15,834
I've heard of faceless singers, but this is the first time seeing a faceless actress.

767
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:23,124
Cut!

768
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:24,924
You lowered your head too much.

769
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:28,084
Then Na Ri needs to lower her head that much, too.

770
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:30,154
Who is Na Ri?

771
00:45:30,154 --> 00:45:31,894
- Is it the horse's name? 
 - Cut!

772
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:34,454
Gosh, the sun is going to set at this rate!

773
00:45:34,454 --> 00:45:36,734
We have to finish filming this today!

774
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,804
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

775
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:41,414
- I'm sorry! 
 - You can do it!

776
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,404
All right, let's focus.

777
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:48,344
Ready, action!

778
00:45:57,744 --> 00:45:59,154
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

779
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:00,914
Are you all right?

780
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:02,464
- A-Are you all right? 
 - Are you all right?

781
00:46:02,464 --> 00:46:04,334
Someone call 911! Hurry, hurry!

782
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:06,264
Are you all right?

783
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,180
A Jeong...

784
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,254
What do we do?

785
00:46:17,804 --> 00:46:20,354
Oh, yes, yes. Someone for the court lady role who can start tomorrow.

786
00:46:20,354 --> 00:46:21,734
Hey!

787
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,294
Are you firing A Jeong?

788
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,064
Just a moment.

789
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:27,284
What are you saying? We're not firing her. She's leaving the drama.

790
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,144
She got hurt, so what can we do? We can't push back the filming.

791
00:46:29,144 --> 00:46:30,444
How could you do this?

792
00:46:30,444 --> 00:46:32,044
She got hurt while doing what she was told!

793
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:34,034
Should we keep waiting until the extra gets better?

794
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,984
Will you pay all of the set rental costs?

795
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:38,114
No, right? I'll get the next scene ready.

796
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:40,534
Yes. Please call me at this number.

797
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:43,854
Gosh, goodness!

798
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:09,494
Thank you.

799
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:18,684
Did the patient wake up?

800
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:20,744
I don't think she's awake yet.

801
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,184
It's too bad.

802
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:25,634
I need to go now,

803
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,814
so you'll need to call a different guardian.

804
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,584
Let's go together.

805
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:41,824
   

806
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:44,384
You don't even have a guardian to call at a time like this?

807
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:46,854
You said my brother was your lover. Is he a lover you can't even call?

808
00:47:46,854 --> 00:47:48,654
I'm only saying this just in case,

809
00:47:48,654 --> 00:47:51,914
but don't tell Do Han what happened today.

810
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:53,444
Well, you know,

811
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:56,734
there are times you don't want other people to see in life.

812
00:47:56,734 --> 00:48:00,074
For me, this is something like that.

813
00:48:00,074 --> 00:48:02,394
Acting all fine and strong while enduring something petty and nasty.

814
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:05,464
In any case, don't tell him.

815
00:48:05,464 --> 00:48:08,544
You said you didn't want to be seen like this, so why are you showing it to me?

816
00:48:08,544 --> 00:48:11,624
Since you have nothing to do with my life.

817
00:48:12,404 --> 00:48:15,254
All right, please keep thinking that way.

818
00:48:15,254 --> 00:48:18,724
Don't ever think to ever cross paths with me again!

819
00:48:25,254 --> 00:48:27,174
About that...

820
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:29,304
Let's cross paths just once.

821
00:48:29,304 --> 00:48:31,824
Please just take me back to the filming set.

822
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:33,404
Why are you going back there?

823
00:48:33,404 --> 00:48:37,614
I have to take the shuttle if I want to go to Seoul anyway.

824
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,744
It would be closed even if I go right now.

825
00:48:54,344 --> 00:48:56,764
Okay, let's go!

826
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:01,014
Should I just drop you off at the major road near the cafe earlier?

827
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:02,984
Aren't you going to Seoul anyway?

828
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:05,154
Why not just take me to Seoul?

829
00:49:05,154 --> 00:49:06,824
You said you were taking the shuttle.

830
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:09,774
You wouldn't give me a ride if I had said that from the start.

831
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:11,974
I'm pretty quick-witted.

832
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:15,544
What are you doing? Let's go.

833
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:25,714
Cheap bastard.

834
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:30,244
It's not even like it costs more gas, yet he had to drop me off at the set.

835
00:49:30,244 --> 00:49:39,634
   

836
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:41,714
Gosh, that looks good.

837
00:49:42,504 --> 00:49:44,194
Lee Do Han.

838
00:49:46,564 --> 00:49:49,634
Ma'am, please give me some chopsticks.

839
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:51,344
Thank you.

840
00:49:51,344 --> 00:49:52,594
How did you know I was here?

841
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:55,474
Hey, it's pretty obvious where you'd go.

842
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:57,854
Home, studio, home, studio.

843
00:49:57,854 --> 00:50:00,744
And you come here to grab a bite when you get hungry.

844
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:02,114
Isn't that true?

845
00:50:02,114 --> 00:50:05,584
What's wrong with your arm? And what happened to your face?

846
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,334
I guess your brother is good at keeping secrets.

847
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:09,914
What?

848
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:13,544
I got hurt while filming.

849
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,874
We said we'd eat noodles here when we're both free.

850
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:18,554
Right now is exactly that time.

851
00:50:33,524 --> 00:50:35,974
Move! Move, move!

852
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,104
Gosh, my back!

853
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,594
That hurts so bad...

854
00:50:42,654 --> 00:50:44,584
My back...

855
00:50:45,704 --> 00:50:47,574
Who sent you?

856
00:50:48,454 --> 00:50:49,774
I said, who sent you!

857
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:52,014
Executive Director Choi Min Woong of LJ Hotel.

858
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:54,014
Have you been following me even from New York?

859
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:55,494
Gosh, I don't even have a passport.

860
00:50:55,494 --> 00:50:58,734
I was hired last week. What are you saying?

861
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:04,054
You received a lot of money from him, right?

862
00:51:04,054 --> 00:51:07,034
In return, I'll take this.

863
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:11,274
If you follow me one more time, I won't let you go that easily.

864
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,364
Hey.

865
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:31,734
I wasn't going to ask since it's your family business,

866
00:51:31,734 --> 00:51:35,054
but what kind of people are your family?

867
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:37,494
Oh, wait.

868
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:41,784
If I hear this, I won't be connected to some crime or anything, right?

869
00:51:41,784 --> 00:51:43,774
Or face threats to my safety?

870
00:51:43,774 --> 00:51:46,204
Hey. Maybe you watched too many dramas.

871
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:48,884
That's all I learned from watching.

872
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:54,024
I think it will be faster

873
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:57,204
to see it for yourself than to tell you about it.

874
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:02,404
I'll introduce my family to you.

875
00:52:06,844 --> 00:52:10,044
Gosh, Lee Do Han found out.

876
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:13,684
He even took away the memory chip.

877
00:52:13,684 --> 00:52:16,874
Gosh, what if he really ends up inheriting the company like this?

878
00:52:16,874 --> 00:52:18,604
I don't know about Lee Ji Han,

879
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:21,114
but Lee Do Han really didn't seem to have any ambition.

880
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:23,404
That can never happen.

881
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:25,324
What do your younger half-siblings know?

882
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:26,744
What do they know about managing a company?

883
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:30,464
First, we need to stop him from marrying Chae Won.

884
00:52:30,464 --> 00:52:34,754
If they get the support of the Taeyang Group, the three of us will never beat them.

885
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:37,604
And all the shareholders will side with them.

886
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:42,334
But wouldn't it be difficult to break up a marriage that even Grandfather is pushing for?

887
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:46,074
Usually, when someone flawless gains a flaw,

888
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:48,434
it becomes even more visible.

889
00:52:48,434 --> 00:52:50,934
   

890
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:56,834
We need to remove that holdout before Grandfather's birthday banquet, no matter what.

891
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:57,894
Holdout?

892
00:52:57,894 --> 00:53:00,524
The holdout that is in Brother's heart.

893
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:02,884
That Na A Jeong or Neo A Jeong. That woman.

894
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:05,534
Oh. Na A Jeong.

895
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:07,504
I looked into her as well.

896
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:10,194
Are you sure she is dating your brother?

897
00:53:10,194 --> 00:53:14,334
Even if it's a long-distance relationship, they would see each other at least once or twice a year.

898
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:16,994
But they neither came nor went to meet in the last five years.

899
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,454
First, take a look at this.

900
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:22,824
What is this?

901
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:29,034
Na A Jeong worked on multiple films in the past five years.

902
00:53:29,034 --> 00:53:32,034
Playing a dead body is given. 
    

903
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:35,554
She even appeared in a ten-million-view zombie movie.

904
00:53:35,554 --> 00:53:36,764
Though she didn't have much of a presence. 
    

905
00:53:36,764 --> 00:53:38,824
   

906
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:41,004
She seems to take on whatever role she is asked.

907
00:53:41,004 --> 00:53:44,064
Last month, she acted as a high school student in uniform. 
    

908
00:53:44,064 --> 00:53:46,464
She seems to have some fixed roles, too. 
    

909
00:53:46,464 --> 00:53:48,144
On the weekend morning reenactment show,

910
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:50,234
she got married so many times.

911
00:53:50,234 --> 00:53:53,904
Not only that, she appeared in various dramas domestically without being picky, 
    

912
00:53:53,904 --> 00:53:57,134
whether it be historical, fantasy, weekend, or daily dramas. 
    

913
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:02,144
So, you're saying she had no time to date or anything like that. 
    

914
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:04,104
In any case, it's a relief...

915
00:54:04,104 --> 00:54:08,034
that this terrifying, scary,

916
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:10,724
and shameless woman is not Brother's honeypot.

917
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,814
But if that was a lie,

918
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,744
why do you think your brother lied like that?

919
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:18,284
Who'd know what he's thinking?

920
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:27,754
Yes?

921
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:32,164
A page from the new complex shopping mall site contract is missing?

922
00:54:32,164 --> 00:54:35,284
What are you talking about? Tell him to look carefully.

923
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:38,664
Please look for it again carefully.

924
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:42,474
They've already looked for it multiple times.

925
00:54:42,474 --> 00:54:44,444
Why would that disappear?

926
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:47,624
I was much more careful with it than my own life—

927
00:54:50,174 --> 00:54:53,734
 A page out of a historical drama script was in there? 

928
00:54:53,734 --> 00:54:55,684
Team Leader.

929
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:58,444
The fake honeypot...

930
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:01,544
Find out that woman Na A Jeong's phone number.

931
00:55:06,074 --> 00:55:08,414
You left this behind that day.

932
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:14,744
Thanks.

933
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:19,774
I couldn't get any of my stuff when I went back to the set because it was all shut down.

934
00:55:20,544 --> 00:55:21,564
Thanks.

935
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:23,304
How could this happen?

936
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:26,314
All this is because of Hong Na Ri!

937
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:28,454
A Jeong...

938
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:30,174
Don't be too upset.

939
00:55:30,174 --> 00:55:33,354
Yeah. Accidents often happen on set,

940
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:35,964
and getting cut in the middle is common, so don't be too upset.

941
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:37,644
I know.

942
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,644
Accidents happen all the time,

943
00:55:39,644 --> 00:55:42,504
and getting cut is common.

944
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:44,334
But why is that me again?

945
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:45,814
A Jeong...

946
00:55:45,814 --> 00:55:51,604
All I want is to be able to earn a living from acting, which I love.

947
00:55:51,604 --> 00:55:53,874
But is my dream too big?

948
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:56,154
Why is it so difficult to achieve it?

949
00:55:56,154 --> 00:55:58,014
Unni...

950
00:55:58,014 --> 00:56:00,914
I felt so pitiful looking through

951
00:56:00,914 --> 00:56:06,374
the part-time job app last night since I lost my measly appearance fee.

952
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:10,324
Damn it, this is so annoying!

953
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:16,894
I'm the one who got cut. Why are you guys crying?

954
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:26,804
- This is so upsetting! 
 - I said, I'm fine!

955
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:28,664
Seriously...

956
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:52,934
Hello?

957
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:54,454
This is Lee Ji Han.

958
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,644
You have my contract, right?

959
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,894
Lee Ji Han?

960
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:01,534
Oh, Do Han's younger brother?

961
00:57:01,534 --> 00:57:03,500
This contract is yours?

962
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,300
Why did you leave this in my bag?

963
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,500
I didn't leave it there. You stole it.

964
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,100
Forget it. Just give me your address.

965
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,704
I'll be seeing you later tonight anyway, so I'll give it to you then.

966
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:14,774
What are you saying? Why would I see you?

967
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:17,214
I'm sending someone to pick it up because I don't want to see you.

968
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:18,764
I guess Do Han didn't say anything.

969
00:57:18,764 --> 00:57:23,200
I was invited to your family's dinner.

970
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,500
Dinner?

971
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,100
Are you coming to the LJ Hotel?

972
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,684
Why would you come there?

973
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:31,224
Didn't you hear what I said? I said I was invited.

974
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:33,124
Anyway, I'll give it to you later tonight.

975
00:57:33,124 --> 00:57:35,624
I'll see you then. Goodbye.

976
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,000
H-Hello?

977
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,444
Did she just hang up on me?

978
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,300
Hey, are you here?

979
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,314
No, stay there. I'll come to get you.

980
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:53,024
Okay.

981
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:57,300
Oh, you're early.

982
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
Chae Won, why are you...

983
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,500
I invited her.

984
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,200
Come and take a seat.

985
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,000
It would be good to show the two of you together on a day like this.

986
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,674
Geez.

987
00:58:10,674 --> 00:58:14,500
I told you I would be announcing you as my successor here.

988
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,800
But didn't we agree to forget about that?

989
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,094
You said fine and just come eat dinner.

990
00:58:20,094 --> 00:58:23,584
That was the only way to get you to come here.

991
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,864
I can't make the same mistake I made five years ago.

992
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:28,500
Chae Won, you stay here with him

993
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,300
and come out and greet everyone together when I call you guys in.

994
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,600
Watch him carefully.

995
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:40,177
Why are you doing this now after hiding me all these years?

996
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:46,024
You thought of me as a blemish on my mother.

997
00:58:46,024 --> 00:58:49,334
So why are you doing this to me now?

998
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm doing this because you are a blemish.

999
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,384
Since you're a blemish, I cannot erase or cover-up.

1000
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:03,484
Since things have come to this,

1001
00:59:03,484 --> 00:59:09,104
my conclusion is to make everyone acknowledge you

1002
00:59:09,104 --> 00:59:11,644
and shut them up.

1003
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,900
What about Ji Han?

1004
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,694
Both Ji Han and I are my mother's illegitimate children, so why only me?

1005
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,600
Ji Han is my blemish.

1006
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,600
That's why he's not the one.

1007
00:59:29,074 --> 00:59:31,344
The guests are waiting.

1008
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:42,064
Is there an event?

1009
00:59:42,754 --> 00:59:45,374
There are so many cameras.

1010
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,100
I believe I said I didn't want to see you.

1011
01:00:01,104 --> 01:00:03,344
Na A Jeong,

1012
01:00:03,344 --> 01:00:04,864
what is your identity?

1013
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:07,514
Are you trying to catch a spy or something?

1014
01:00:07,514 --> 01:00:09,600
I'm a guest Do Han invited. Who else?

1015
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,800
You're not my brother's lover.

1016
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,494
Everything you said about loving him or whatnot was all a lie.

1017
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:16,900
You're still talking about that.

1018
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:21,300
When you asked me not to tell Brother about your pathetic situation. Did you mean that?

1019
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,694
Are you sure you weren't secretly hoping I would tell him?

1020
01:00:23,694 --> 01:00:24,900
What did you say?

1021
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,100
Why are you blinding my brother by pretending you're successful and have no issues?

1022
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,784
I noticed that you've done a lot.

1023
01:00:30,784 --> 01:00:34,000
Did you decide to give up on a job that doesn't even cover accidents like falling off a horse

1024
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,500
and act as my brother's doting lover?

1025
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,544
But does Brother know that you've been cut?

1026
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,700
Doesn't this sound strange even to you?

1027
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:54,994
You're a fake.

1028
01:00:54,994 --> 01:00:56,754
Right?

1029
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,100
What is all this?

1030
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:05,894
A Jeong.

1031
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:08,800
I guess there is an event here today.

1032
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,900
It's quite noisy here.

1033
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,900
And my feelings are quite chaotic, too.

1034
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,000
So why did you invite her here?

1035
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,464
And why did you lie about her being your lover when you're not even dating her?

1036
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:31,700
Ji Han, I also...

1037
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,200
have at least one thing I want to hide from you!

1038
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,600
And will it satisfy you to uncover that and make me feel pathetic?

1039
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,884
Must everything ultimately go your way to make you happy?

1040
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,900
What is it? What do you want?

1041
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,600
Why are close brothers arguing and yelling out of the blue?

1042
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,700
- Get out. 
 - Listen to how you're talking to your brother...

1043
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:02,400
Hey, Lee Do Han. What should you do? You're caught red-handed.

1044
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,900
You have a girlfriend, right?

1045
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,300
I said, get out.

1046
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,374
Geez, dang it.

1047
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,100
Where did you get that?

1048
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,614
Hey, were you the one behind this?

1049
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,400
How dare you speak down to her?

1050
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,500
This came from an anonymous source to Grandfather.

1051
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,774
Who cares who hired them, Do Han?

1052
01:02:31,774 --> 01:02:34,500
Wow, was this it?

1053
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,100
The reason you would give up on LJ and gaining Taeyang Group's support?

1054
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,654
Oh, gosh.

1055
01:02:41,654 --> 01:02:46,300
Do Han, what will Grandfather say when he finds out about this?

1056
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,600
Brother isn't dating this woman.

1057
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,300
I checked.

1058
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,200
So, stop threatening him with this useless photo and get lost.

1059
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,434
- This bastard, just because I went easy on you— 
 - It's true.

1060
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,500
The reason I said I won't get married...

1061
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,094
is because of that woman in the photo.

1062
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:08,594
So, the thing I have come to realize as I grow older

1063
01:03:08,594 --> 01:03:15,344
was that you were the giver, not me.

1064
01:03:17,204 --> 01:03:20,114
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1065
01:03:38,914 --> 01:03:40,624
Hey.

1066
01:03:43,334 --> 01:03:46,134
I'm sorry for lying.

1067
01:03:46,134 --> 01:03:48,500
I thought you'd be honest with me.

1068
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,600
I guess that is why I couldn't tell you all the more.

1069
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,814
Just up until five years ago, you were wary of how I felt.

1070
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,300
You acted like you had no work because you were afraid of hurting my ego.

1071
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,304
I'm not saying what I did was right.

1072
01:04:03,304 --> 01:04:07,474
I'm just saying that's why I lied.

1073
01:04:07,474 --> 01:04:10,294
I guess it's an excuse under the guise of an explanation.

1074
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

1075
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,200
I will be talking about the new future leader

1076
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,314
who will continue with you in the time to come.

1077
01:04:28,554 --> 01:04:31,000
Hey, Na A Jeong.

1078
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,900
Do you want to take on an acting role?

1079
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,200
You can do all the acting you love to do.

1080
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,200
Not only that, you will be the lead and not an extra.

1081
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,000
You're just throwing things at me because you're worried about my feelings, right?

1082
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I'll also pay you however much you want.

1083
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,654
You talk as if you're a chaebol.

1084
01:04:49,234 --> 01:04:52,244
Then pay me 2 billion won, and I'll consider it.

1085
01:04:52,244 --> 01:04:55,000
Okay. I'll give you 2 billion won.

1086
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I think about three years would be good for the duration.

1087
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,600
Wait.

1088
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,800
What are you saying?

1089
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,544
It is exactly as I am saying.

1090
01:05:02,544 --> 01:05:06,164
I really need you for that role.

1091
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,900
I almost sent her away without getting my contract back.

1092
01:05:15,314 --> 01:05:18,994
What the... Why are they together again?

1093
01:05:18,994 --> 01:05:21,724
Gosh, the announcement is about to happen.

1094
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,600
What is that role?

1095
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,300
The role of my grandfather's granddaughter-in-law.

1096
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,400
All right.

1097
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,534
Let me introduce my grandson, Lee Do Han.

1098
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:59,050


1099
01:06:05,634 --> 01:06:08,300
Hey, by chance...

1100
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,300
are you the Lee Do Han they are referring to over there?

1101
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,414
A Jeong,

1102
01:06:14,414 --> 01:06:17,374
by chance, would you be willing to marry me?

1103
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:22,514
Please, marry me.

1104
01:06:22,514 --> 01:06:24,294
No!

1105
01:06:40,014 --> 01:06:43,204
♫  I fly with you  ♫

1106
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:45,644
♫  Azure feelings come blowing  ♫

1107
01:06:45,644 --> 01:06:48,514
♫  What do we do?  ♫

1108
01:06:48,514 --> 01:06:51,174
♫  A night filled with dreams  ♫

1109
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,914
♫  Only you and I  ♫

1110
01:06:53,914 --> 01:06:57,284
♫  In all the days and scenes containing you  ♫

1111
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:59,934
♫  Butterflies are flying around  ♫

1112
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:03,274
♫  Butterflies are you and I, yeah  ♫

1113
01:07:03,274 --> 01:07:08,114
♫  I hear a new start  ♫

1114
01:07:08,114 --> 01:07:11,500
   

1115
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,800
 Where is this? 

1116
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,774
 You must not remember what happened yesterday. 

1117
01:07:14,774 --> 01:07:19,394
 I do remember. I ran away from really suspicious people with a less suspicious you. 

1118
01:07:19,394 --> 01:07:23,164
 If I must get married anyway, I want to marry you since you know my situation. 

1119
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,074
 You're good at acting. 

1120
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:26,384
 He's not even asking you out. He wants to go directly to marriage from being friends? 

1121
01:07:26,384 --> 01:07:28,600
 A Jeong, why are you here? 

1122
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,200
 Based on my statistics, 

1123
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,004
 I got indigestion whenever I ate whatever because I was in a hurry. 

1124
01:07:34,004 --> 01:07:37,414
 Where did that woman suddenly appear from? 

1125
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,300
♫  Over the skyline, over the world  ♫
