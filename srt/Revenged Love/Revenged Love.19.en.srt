00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 19, This Path
Might Be a Very Difficult One)

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Da Wei.

4
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Be strong.

5
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
You make a lot of money now.

6
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,520
You can buy your mom
the best medicine.

7
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,640
As long as your mom
has a good mentality,

8
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
living a few more years
won't be a problem.

9
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,800
Why didn't Chi Cheng...

10
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,800
tell me?

11
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,760
Maybe he's worried about you.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Or maybe he just doesn't know
how to tell you.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,960
There are a lot of patients
like that in our ward.

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,360
The closest people to them
were the last to know.

15
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
Xiao Shuai.

16
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,960
Later, when the doctor comes out,

17
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
help me ask him for me.

18
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,960
This isn't my profession.

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm afraid I'd miss something.

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Okay.

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
No problem.

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,520
Family members,
the patient is awake.

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
When you go in, don't cry.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Do you hear me?

25
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Mom.

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
You're so sick.

27
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
You kept it from me for so long.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
It's my fault too.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,680
I've been busy with my own stuff.

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Da Qiong.

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,880
Don't blame Xiao Chi.

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,560
I told him not to tell you.

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
You have enough on your plate
to worry about.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,040
I really don't want you...

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
to worry about me.

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Mom.

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,800
Technology is so advanced now.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sure you can be cured.

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,040
I believe you.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't cry.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's enough.

43
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Don't.

44
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,719
Mr. Chi.

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
- Throw it.
- Don't panic.

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,920
One, two, three, go.

47
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,040
This is exciting.

48
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,720
How is she, doctor?

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,640
All tests came back normal.

50
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Mrs. Wu.

51
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
Hey, let's do it together.

52
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Mom.

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I'll give you a massage.

54
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Da Qiong.

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm a burden to you.

56
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,240
You're not a burden.

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,080
You must be exhausted, Da Qiong.

58
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Come in.

59
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
Thank you, Xiao Shuai.

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,800
You always come to visit my mom.

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Don't worry about it.

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,440
I just got off work a little early.

63
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Besides,

64
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,920
my clinic is full of patients.

65
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
They'll understand.

66
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Do you think...

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,119
my mom's condition...

68
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Gosh, don't worry.

69
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,639
Your mom's mentality...

70
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
is much better than when she was
just hospitalized.

71
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,920
But I feel like she's a child.

72
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,120
She can only fall asleep
if I coax her.

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Also,

74
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,440
once she falls asleep,
she always sleeps for a long time.

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Wu Suo Wei.

76
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Why are you here?

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
You guys talk.

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I'll stay with Mrs. Wu for a while.

79
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Okay.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
I heard about your mom.

81
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I...

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
have a friend in the US...

83
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
who specializes
in pancreatic tumors.

84
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
I asked him to come
and check on her.

85
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,520
He's probably
on the plane right now.

86
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
He'll be here tomorrow.

87
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,519
I came in advance...

88
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
to talk to you
and the attending physician.

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Thank you.

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Sorry for troubling you.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Thank you.

92
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
That's what friends are for.

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,640
Look at yourself.

94
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,560
You're not the one who got dumped.

95
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
That's easy for you to say.

96
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
The probability...

97
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
of this kind of thing
happening to me is zero.

98
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,520
You've never dated.

99
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,640
How could you get dumped?

100
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,920
And now, you're even
finding him a doctor.

101
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,320
You don't even know
if he'll appreciate it.

102
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Right now,

103
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,600
you look like
the whole world has wronged you.

104
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,200
It makes me look down on you.

105
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,480
What right do you have
to look down on me?

106
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,640
Wang Zhen, I'm telling you.

107
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't be so arrogant every day.

108
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,960
I've told you before.

109
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,479
Mom doesn't want a son...

110
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,960
who doesn't
acknowledge his family like you.

111
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,360
If I didn't pity you,

112
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,680
you'd be homeless now.

113
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
What you're doing...

114
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,960
only proves that Chi Cheng
made the right choice.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,280
What... What do you know?

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
People like you...

117
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,400
won't understand me.

118
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,280
Do you remember when we were kids?

119
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,400
We only had
one corn stick snack left that time.

120
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,480
Mom told us to split it
and share it.

121
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,040
You cried and screamed...

122
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,120
because you wanted
to eat the long piece.

123
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960
Mom had no choice
but to make the long piece shorter.

124
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,600
In the end, the short piece
became the long piece.

125
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
She had to keep breaking it.

126
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,280
After so much breaking,

127
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
neither of us got to eat it
in the end.

128
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
But you clapped your hands
happily instead.

129
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
Because to you,

130
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,120
having it is more important
than enjoying it.

131
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,640
You'd rather not eat it...

132
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,640
than eat less of it.

133
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
You've changed today.

134
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,000
You're talking so much.

135
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,720
Green-Eyed Monster,
I got you a new home.

136
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,200
I'll just put him in.

137
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
Thank you, Wei Wei.

138
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,360
Look, what's this called?

139
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
This...

140
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,440
should be...

141
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,760
my red bow tie.

142
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Right?

143
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,160
But the one you made
doesn't look like him.

144
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,960
He isn't a cobra.

145
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,800
That's venom.

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
Tell me if it looks like him.

147
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Here.

148
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,040
Be gentle.

149
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,360
That muscle is tight.

150
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
I'm a professional.

151
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,520
Lower.

152
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,400
How is it? Feels good, right?

153
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,160
Try my cooking.

154
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
Can you cook?

155
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
Don't worry. My skill is similar
to Guo Cheng Yu's.

156
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Be careful, it's hot.

157
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Is it that bad?

158
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,960
Let's order takeout.
We'll order takeout, okay?

159
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
I'm thinking.

160
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,840
The sunset is so beautiful.

161
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,159
But the person with me...

162
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,720
didn't shave.

163
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,720
I am full of hormones.

164
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
I shaved this morning,

165
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,359
but it grew back now.

166
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
You...

167
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Green-Eyed Monster?

168
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,601
He's just like
an inner demon at home.

169
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,720
Let him stay with you.

170
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,960
Why is he like an inner demon?

171
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Isn't he...

172
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
with Wang Shuo every day?

173
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Snakes are also like humans.

174
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
He sees you as family.

175
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,360
To him, Wang Shuo
is just a companion.

176
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,520
It's okay
if it's just for a few days.

177
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,960
But if it's too long,

178
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,120
it absolutely won't work.

179
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,960
It's been listless at home for days.

180
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I realized...

181
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,040
that listening to you talk
feels so good.

182
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
You know what?

183
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,239
The expert you found for me...

184
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
is very useful.

185
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,640
My mom has much more energy now.

186
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Thank you.

187
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,679
Where did you buy this?

188
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,000
I loved it when I was little.

189
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Eat it.

190
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,960
No, you can have it.

191
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,120
I was waiting for you to say that.

192
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
You're smarter
than Wang Shuo indeed.

193
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,680
Give all this to your mom.

194
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,200
I'm sure she'll love it.

195
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,079
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

196
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

197
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Wu Suo Wei.

198
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
What's the matter?

199
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,400
I'm leaving soon.

200
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
I'll take Wang Shuo with me.

201
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,240
- Will you still come back?
- I will.

202
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Okay.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,840
When you come back,
to teach me new kung fu.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Bye.

205
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,280
You're stronger than Wang Shuo.

206
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,520
Chi Cheng can give you...

207
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,040
your sense of security.

208
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,120
But only I can give
the sense of security...

209
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,480
that Wang Shuo wants.

210
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Hurry up.

211
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,400
I'm coming.

212
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Mr. Chi.

213
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,320
Mr. Chi, aren't you coming in?

214
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
No.

215
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,800
I'll wait for the next one.

216
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
What are you doing?

217
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
You're finally willing
to come to your boyfriend.

218
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Wu Suo Wei just got dumped...

219
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,360
and his mom is very sick.

220
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
I have to take care of him.

221
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
So...

222
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,040
you can just ignore your boyfriend?

223
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,679
Aren't you afraid...

224
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,880
that I'll keep a secret lover
at home?

225
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,999
You'd keep a secret lover?

226
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,760
Who? Chi Cheng?

227
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,120
How did you know?

228
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,600
Cheng Yu is mine.

229
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
You're not needed here.

230
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Get lost.

231
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Shuai Shuai.

232
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,079
This idiot said his house
is too big.

233
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,416
He feels lonely and cold by himself,

234
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,199
so he insists
on staying here with me.

235
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm not lying.

236
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,200
How... How long
has he been living here?

237
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,920
I've been living here...

238
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,880
for as long as you were gone.

239
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Can you shut up?

240
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
Shuai Shuai.

241
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,120
- Shuai Shuai.
- Don't spoil him.

242
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,480
Shuai Shuai.

243
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,120
Can I spoil him with you around?

244
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,240
Cheng Yu, I'm having a hard time.
Can't you come and keep me company?

245
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Come on.

246
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Fine.

247
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Come on.

248
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Move.

249
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,680
Your timing is so good.

250
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,920
He went to work today.

251
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,560
Then aren't you going to visit him?

252
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
I can't go all the time.

253
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,319
It's not a big deal.

254
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,640
Do you have to act like this?

255
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,320
If Jiang Xiao Shuai said
he never loved you,

256
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,480
how would you feel?

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The two of us...

258
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,920
aren't as dramatic as you two.

259
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
I am...

260
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,280
not as petty as you either.

261
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,959
Even if Jiang Xiao Shuai
really says...

262
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,560
he doesn't love me anymore one day,

263
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,560
I'll still pursue him,

264
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
pamper him,

265
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and keep pestering him.

266
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,960
I'll keep loving him...

267
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,720
until he falls in love
with me again.

268
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,200
You're so darn cheap.

269
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes. A cheap jerk with a mouth.

270
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,080
When something occurs
or happens to me,

271
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,040
I'll explain things clearly
and talk it out.

272
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Unlike you.

273
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,800
You're here drinking...

274
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,760
and smoking.

275
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,680
If he can figure things out,

276
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,640
he can do so on his own
without anyone's explanation.

277
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,080
If he can't figure it out,

278
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,520
he would dwell on it...

279
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,400
and won't ask me.

280
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,040
I remember,

281
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,200
back then,

282
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,080
didn't you dwell on things too?

283
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
How dare you bring that up?

284
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,640
You didn't explain things
to me back then either.

285
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Darn it.

286
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,239
Whatever you say, Chi Cheng.

287
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
Come on. Let's drink.

288
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Cheng Yu.

289
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,120
To be honest,

290
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
if our reconciliation
didn't calm me down a bit,

291
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,000
I really can't handle this.

292
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Come on.

293
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,960
Let's play a game.

294
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,800
Let's play Two Little Bees...

295
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
like we did back then.

296
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Come on.

297
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Hurry up.

298
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,400
- Two little bees,
- Two little bees,

299
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,976
- flying to the flower shrubs.
- Flying to the flower shrubs.

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
- Flying to the left,
- Flying to the left,

301
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,176
- flying to the right.
- Flying to the right.

302
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,280
- Fly!
- Fly!

303
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,720
Shuai Shuai, are you free tonight?

304
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,000
Come to my place for dinner.

305
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,320
Isn't Chi Cheng still there?

306
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,399
If he's there, I'm not coming.

307
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I have to go.

308
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,640
Should we think of a way
to lure Chi Cheng out for a while?

309
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,680
I've become
a freaking herbivore now.

310
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
What do you have in mind?

311
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,360
Let's find him another guy.

312
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,599
Ever since he was with Mr. Wu,
Chi Cheng's philandering habits...

313
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,680
have lessened.

314
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,960
That's a good idea.

315
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I wonder
if he's in the mood for that now.

316
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's give it a try.

317
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,880
Should we find a man or a woman?

318
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
A man or a woman?

319
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
It's up to you.

320
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,800
Any requirements?

321
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Big eyes.

322
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Try it.

323
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,680
I just made this...

324
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
for you this morning.

325
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,000
I made it myself.

326
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
It looks, smells, and tastes good.

327
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,840
Is there anyone else...

328
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,360
in the house besides you?

329
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
No.

330
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,800
If you dare to lie to me,
I won't talk to you for a week.

331
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
You're so childish.

332
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,200
How can you still say
that kind of thing at your age?

333
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
You must be hungry.
Eat something first, okay?

334
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I'll feed you.

335
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Try it.

336
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
Guo Cheng Yu.

337
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
What is this?

338
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,200
This... This isn't a person.

339
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Right?

340
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,680
There are a lot of people
in your house, right?

341
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,160
Chi Cheng...

342
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
is not considered a person too.

343
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,919
If you want to play, go inside.

344
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Why did you come out?

345
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,040
Her eyes are too big.

346
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,800
I feel scared,

347
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,320
dude.

348
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Xiao Shuai.

349
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,560
Guo Cheng Yu, you...

350
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,320
- You two...
- Carry on.

351
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,760
Don't mind me.
I'm not considered a person.

352
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,280
Xiao Shuai, I can explain.

353
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,320
The three of you
can enjoy yourselves.

354
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,359
I don't want to talk
to you for a week.

355
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Don't.

356
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
A week is too much.

357
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Half a day.

358
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,120
- A day at most, okay?
- No!

359
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
Darn you.

360
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Shuai Shuai.

361
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Shuai Shuai.

362
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,280
Didn't you go
to Guo Cheng Yu's place?

363
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,680
Why are you here?

364
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
Right now,

365
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,040
Chi Cheng is staying
at his place too.

366
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
He doesn't need me.

367
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Da Wei.

368
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,400
You really don't mind?

369
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,080
Why should I care?

370
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,679
You're the one
who should be jealous.

371
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,360
You're madly in love
with Guo Cheng Yu now.

372
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
You don't want anyone
to get in your way.

373
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,160
That's very normal.

374
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,440
Are you planning to continue being
like this with Chi Cheng forever?

375
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
By the way,

376
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,880
I'm curious.

377
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,199
Why did Yue Yue
disappear without a trace...

378
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,680
after coming to me once?

379
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,400
What do you mean?

380
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm just wondering.

381
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
She only showed up twice,

382
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,200
then she completely disappeared.

383
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,279
I've been asking around about her,

384
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,760
but I haven't heard anything.

385
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,720
She must have done something bad
and went into hiding.

386
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,920
But since she suddenly appeared
at that point in time,

387
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,280
someone must have
instructed her to do it.

388
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Also,

389
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,280
the person who's helping her hide...

390
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,440
is quite capable.

391
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,759
The person who's helping her
do bad things...

392
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,400
must be really good.

393
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,440
Who are you talking about?

394
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,640
Isn't it obvious?

395
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,159
Aside from Wang Shuo,

396
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
who else can it be?

397
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
Green-Eyed Monster.

398
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,759
Mr. Wu, take a look at this.

399
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,439
Xiao Lin, did you come
into the office earlier?

400
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,760
Did you see a big box here?

401
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,920
I left a document here
this morning, then I...

402
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,120
The cleaning lady was here.

403
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,999
She did seem to be holding
a box this big.

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,080
It looked quite heavy.

405
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,959
She said
she was throwing it away as scrap.

406
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
What?

407
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
- Move.
- What's wrong, Mr. Wu?

408
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Mr. Wu.

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Mr. Wu.

410
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Let me do it.

411
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I found it.

412
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

413
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,599
I really didn't know your office...

414
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,160
- That scared me.
- Had this.

415
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,400
Are you alone today?

416
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,880
Where's Xiao Wu?

417
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,400
You still remember him?

418
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,080
Yes. Of course I remember
a customer like Xiao Wu.

419
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Go get some food first.

420
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:35,761
- I'll let you get to work.
- Okay.

421
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Miss.

422
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
- I'm done.
- Okay.

423
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,640
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

424
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,120
Here's yours.

425
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,640
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

426
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,160
The spicy hot pot you ordered
is really different from Xiao Wu's.

427
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,216
Every time he comes,
he doesn't just take anything.

428
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,719
Vegetarian food and meat dishes.

429
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,960
He weighs them as he goes.

430
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,360
He controls the price precisely.

431
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes.

432
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,600
He's a cheapskate.

433
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Enjoy your meal.

434
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,960
(Store for lease)

435
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Miss.

436
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,400
Are you closing your shop?

437
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,840
We're closing down.
Business is getting worse.

438
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,400
When I came here before,

439
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,560
wasn't business good?

440
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,520
That was a long time ago.

441
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,040
Look at the market now.

442
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,440
Everything has changed.

443
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,280
Take your time eating.

444
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,520
Mom, let me wipe your feet.

445
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,560
After washing your feet,
get some rest.

446
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,360
All right. I'll help you to bed.

447
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,560
Xiao Chi.

448
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Come here.

449
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Mrs. Wu.

450
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
I'm here.

451
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
I'm here.

452
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,440
I...

453
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,400
I...

454
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,400
I know.

455
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,280
I understand...

456
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,760
you two.

457
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Mrs. Wu.

458
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,160
I didn't hear you.

460
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Say it again.

461
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,960
Repeat it.

462
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,280
I...

463
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,200
I am...

464
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
I'm just afraid...

465
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,840
for you two.

466
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,120
This path...

467
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
might...

468
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,480
It might be...

469
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,800
a very difficult one.

470
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Mrs. Wu.

471
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Mrs. Wu.

472
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,920
It's okay.

473
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,600
You'll be fine.

474
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,280
You and him...

475
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,640
should be good together.

476
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Mrs. Wu.

477
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Mom.

478
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,120
Da Qiong.

479
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
I...

480
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,280
I want...

481
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,520
to go home.

482
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Mom.

483
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,640
The doctor said
all indicators aren't stable yet.

484
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,640
It's not recommended
to get discharged.

485
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,720
I've been here long enough.

486
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,000
I... I want to go home.

487
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,960
Da Qiong.

488
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,360
- Okay.
- Take...

489
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,640
Take me home.

490
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,720
Mom, let's go home.

491
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
- Mom.
- Give it to me.

492
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,119
I'll cook for you.

493
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,319
There's no need.

494
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Today, I'll cook for you.

495
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
Mom, don't bother.

496
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Get some rest.

497
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,279
Today, I feel very energetic.

498
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm in good condition.

499
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
All right.

500
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Go to your room and rest.

501
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,279
There's no need, Mom.

502
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,200
- I'll stay here with you.
- Okay.

503
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
Look.

504
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,520
This flower is growing so well.

505
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Here, Mom.

506
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Have some soup.

507
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
Da Qiong.

508
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,240
When are you...

509
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,640
going to get me a daughter-in-law?

510
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Soon.

511
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,600
Xiao Chi must be very busy lately.

512
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
He...

513
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
is quite busy.

514
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,400
Xiao Chi is a good person.

515
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,880
He's nice.

516
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Mom.

517
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Mom.

518
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Let's eat.

519
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Okay.

520
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Mom.

521
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
Why are you sleeping here?

522
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,920
Let's go.
I'll help you to your room.

523
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Mom.

524
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Look at you.

525
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
It's summer...

526
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,560
and you're sleeping in the yard.

527
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,600
What if it's winter?

528
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,080
I can't be with you all the time.

529
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,760
If you have a headache or a fever,

530
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,920
I can't take care of you.

531
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Mom.

532
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,600
Why don't I buy a house nearby?

533
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,680
You can move in with me...

534
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,840
and I can take care of you.

535
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,440
You always say it's a blessing
to suffer losses.

536
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,480
It's good to live a peaceful life.

537
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Mom.

538
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,360
Actually, I never told you...

539
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,320
that I started a company.

540
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,160
I didn't want you to worry about me,

541
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,640
so I didn't dare to tell you.

542
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,120
You won't blame me, right?

543
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,280
Actually, I deserve to be blamed.

544
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I'm unfilial.

545
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,280
I didn't give you a good life.

546
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Mom.

547
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm sorry.

548
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,720
I lied to you again.

549
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,200
I don't think...

550
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,960
I'd ever get a wife
in this lifetime.

551
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Mom.

552
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Mom.

553
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,800
Don't go.

554
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
Mom.
