(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 21, Father-in-Law)

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,520
Xiao Shuai,
is Young Master Guo with you?

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Cheng Yu?

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
He's not here.

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,720
He just got a call,

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
then he left in a hurry.

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,616
And he wouldn't let me go with him.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,976
I'm afraid something
would happen to him.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
That's why I'm calling to ask.

11
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,760
- Why are you doing this?
- If he's not there, I'm hanging up.

12
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,680
Chi Cheng, darn you!

13
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Why did you deceive him?

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,440
Don't you know he's been hurt?

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
Even if you're Chi Cheng,

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
you can't do that!

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,600
I deceived him. So what?

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Stop it!

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Xiao Shuai.

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,920
Come on. Let's go home.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Go home?

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Which home?

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Don't you know your own home?

24
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Let's go.

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,520
- Am I good or what?
- You are.

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Come on.

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Let's go home.

28
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
What are you doing?

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
I'm thirsty.

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
I want some water.

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Do you want some?

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm fine.

33
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,280
It's so hot today.

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
It's hot.

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
I'm going to take a shower.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Wait for me here.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Okay?

38
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
This show's quite good.

39
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,960
I heard there are
four new episodes today.

40
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,560
Why don't we watch them all?

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,720
Four episodes.

42
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,360
Do you want to finish watching them?

43
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Why is it dark?

44
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,960
I think there's a blackout.

45
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Did you pull the power on purpose?

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't slander me.

47
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
I'll go out and check...

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
if the fuse box is broken.

49
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,079
Don't. Don't go.

50
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
I'm scared.

51
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
It's okay. Don't be scared.

52
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll light some candles.

53
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,360
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

54
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Come closer.

55
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
So...

56
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,960
you're not scared now, right?

57
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Try this.

58
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,680
- It's good.
- Yes, it's tasty.

59
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
- Are you exhausted?
- I'm okay.

60
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Did you get your fill?

61
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Yes.

62
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm freaking asking you
about that stuff.

63
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,640
That's what I'm freaking...

64
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
talking about.

65
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
How was...

66
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Cheng Yu?

67
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,800
He's probably better than Chi Cheng.

68
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
No way!

69
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,960
Cheng Yu, how many times
a night can...

70
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,400
I have a secret.
Do you want to hear it?

71
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Cheng Yu told me about it.

72
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Tell me.

73
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,840
In order to get you fed,

74
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
I freaking didn't get my fill.

75
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I have pimples now.

76
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,840
Wang Zhen and Wang Shuo
don't seem to be real brothers.

77
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,759
Wang Shuo
isn't his mom's biological son.

78
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
He was adopted.

79
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
What?

80
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
It's true.

81
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,400
Don't tell anyone.

82
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Don't worry.

83
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,040
Keep an eye on this for me.

84
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,640
Go. I'll keep an eye on this.

85
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,919
Listen. Don't tell anyone
about this.

86
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,720
Okay? Don't breathe
a word to anyone, got it?

87
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,160
- What's up?
- What's up?

88
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Come on.

89
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
What are you doing?

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
Chi Cheng, what are you doing?

91
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Let go of me.

92
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Don't strip me.

93
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
There are so many people.

94
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't touch me.

95
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Awesome.

96
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Don't look.

97
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,400
It's not suitable for children.

98
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
You're so heavy.

99
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,040
(By filial son, Wu Qi Qiong)

100
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,719
(Grave of loving dad and mom,
Wu Tian Xiang, Zhang Li Ya)

101
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Mom.

102
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,880
My company recently
got a big project.

103
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
It's going to start work soon.

104
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Right now, my company...

105
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,200
is a bit well-known...

106
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
in the industry.

107
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,560
Mom, Chi Cheng always says
I'm stingy.

108
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,400
Am I stingy? I'm not.

109
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
I've always remembered
what you told me.

110
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,216
I should save what I must
and spend what I have to.

111
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
I shouldn't spend on
what I don't need.

112
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
Mom, I already saved up...

113
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,000
a lot of money.

114
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,640
I was saving...

115
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
for my wedding before.

116
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Now,

117
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm saving for our retirement.

118
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,640
I've already planned
the rest of our lives.

119
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Don't worry, Mom.

120
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Dad.

121
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,120
I found you a son-in-law.

122
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,360
Apart from being a man,

123
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,640
he has no other flaws.

124
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
You know what?

125
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,720
He never let me do the housework.

126
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,200
And he entrusts me...

127
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,840
with his money.

128
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
You know what?

129
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
My partner...

130
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
is so easy to coax.

131
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,800
No matter what I do wrong,

132
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
once I smile at him,

133
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,480
he can't do anything to me.

134
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Dad, you haven't met
my partner, have you?

135
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
Someday, I'll burn
a couple of photos...

136
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
to show him to you.

137
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680
That's all I want to tell you.

138
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,080
I'll visit you often.

139
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll get going, Mom and Dad.

140
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,200
(Grave of loving dad and mom,
Wu Tian Xiang, Zhang Li Ya)

141
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,520
- Come with us.
- Wait. Who are you?

142
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
- Hurry!
- Wait.

143
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,960
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

144
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,960
Wait. I sprained my ankle.

145
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't touch me.

146
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,800
Have I been kidnapped?

147
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Why am I tied up so humanely?

148
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,560
Do you know who I am?

149
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,720
Then tell me.

150
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Who am I?

151
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Father...

152
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Father-in-law.

153
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,999
Mr. Zhao from Jia'er Culture said...

154
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,520
something came up
and he can't make it.

155
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,000
That's so rude.

156
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
It's okay.

157
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,600
(Wei Wei)

158
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
(Wei Wei)

159
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Where are we going later?

160
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Let's go home.

161
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,000
I haven't been home in a while.

162
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Dad.

163
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm home.

164
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,160
Don't speak. Hush.

165
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Where's my mom?

166
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
Your mom went to your sister.

167
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,880
My sister's coming back?

168
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Why didn't you tell me?

169
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,439
You don't come home
for three to five months.

170
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,400
Is there a difference
if we tell you or not?

171
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Chi Cheng.

172
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Are you hiding someone?

173
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,880
A few days ago,
your uncle sent a puppy.

174
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm keeping him in that room.

175
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,200
These are organic vegetables
from our garden.

176
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
Try her cooking.

177
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Are you free tomorrow?

178
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,320
What do you want me to do?

179
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,440
Go on a blind date with me.

180
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,400
You're already so old.

181
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,160
You still want to get a new wife?

182
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Does my mom know?

183
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,600
What are you talking about?

184
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,160
It's a blind date for you.

185
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,320
Why are you going on my blind date?

186
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm afraid you'll scare
the young lady away.

187
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
I'm already scary enough.

188
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,200
Wouldn't it be scarier
if you went too?

189
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,720
Based on what you're saying,

190
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
you're planning to go tomorrow?

191
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
No.

192
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,536
No? Then why are you wasting time
talking nonsense with me?

193
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,520
Since you're talking to me,
I'm responding to you.

194
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
I can't ignore you, can I?

195
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,680
Chi Cheng!

196
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's so noisy.

197
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Based on the sound,

198
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
I think he broke your antique vase.

199
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Why didn't you tie him?

200
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
It's a hassle
even when he's tied up.

201
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,199
The room is not that big.

202
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,840
He can reach things
wherever he's tied up.

203
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,280
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

204
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,559
It turns out that Chi Cheng's habit
of running his mouth...

205
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,320
is from his dad.

206
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Let him out then.

207
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Don't open the door.

208
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,520
That dog bites strangers.

209
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,879
A few days ago, your uncle came
and got bitten.

210
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,160
He just got his third injection.

211
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
What breed is it?

212
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
It's a crossbreed.

213
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
A crossbreed?

214
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,841
Kill him. What's the point
of keeping him then?

215
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,320
Are you going
on the blind date tomorrow or not?

216
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
I'm not going.

217
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
If you're not going, get lost.

218
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Sit up and eat something.

219
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,279
It used to be Chi Cheng...

220
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,760
who ate my leftovers.

221
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,680
Now, it's finally
the other way around.

222
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,399
Hello, Xiao Lin.

223
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,960
- Mr. Chi.
- Have you seen Mr. Wu?

224
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Mr. Wu?

225
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
No.

226
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,160
I haven't seen him all day.

227
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
I see.

228
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Did you find him?

229
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
Has Wu Suo Wei offended
anyone lately?

230
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,360
Who can he offend?

231
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,920
Even if he did,

232
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
in this area,

233
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,816
there are only
a handful of people...

234
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,960
who would dare to touch him.

235
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Chi Cheng.

236
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Could it be your dad?

237
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Are you hiding someone?

238
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,040
A few days ago,
your uncle sent a puppy.

239
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,280
I'm keeping him in that room.

240
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Don't open the door.

241
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
That dog bites strangers.

242
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,640
A few days ago, your uncle came
and got bitten.

243
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
He just had his third injection.

244
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,880
How did his dad know about them?

245
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
You little fool.

246
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,960
His dad has spies all over the city.

247
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
The two of them
eat and live together.

248
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,440
On top of that, he did this before.

249
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,200
Do you think his dad doesn't know?

250
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,120
Even if his dad knows,

251
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
he can just call him over...

252
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:57,800
and teach him a lesson.

253
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
Use your little brain.

254
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,240
What kind of person is his dad?

255
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Think about it.

256
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Can an ordinary person...

257
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
have a son like him?

258
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,840
At a time like this,

259
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,640
stop joking around with me.

260
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Pause it.

261
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Zoom in.

262
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
(July 10th, 2024, Wednesday)

263
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
(July 10th, 2024, Wednesday)

264
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Keep an eye on it for me.

265
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
- Thank you.
- Okay.

266
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,960
If I don't know him well enough,

267
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,560
I'd think I was wrong about him.

268
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Young Master Chi.

269
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,600
The chairman is meeting
with an important client.

270
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,920
If it's urgent, you can tell me.

271
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll pass it on for you.

272
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay.

273
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Tell him...

274
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,760
to take care of himself.

275
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Wei Wei!

276
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Wei Wei!

277
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Wei Wei!

278
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Wei Wei!

279
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Hello, Young Master Chi.

280
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Wait.

281
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,680
Who did you bring food to?

282
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
I brought it to Mr. Chi.

283
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
My dad never eats late-night snacks.

284
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,560
My sister and mom
aren't home either.

285
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Ms. Wang.

286
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Tell me the truth.

287
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,280
Who did you bring it to?

288
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,160
During the day,
Mr. Chi kidnapped a young man.

289
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,919
I brought it to him.

290
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,000
What kind of young man?

291
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Where is he?

292
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
He's tall and thin,

293
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
with big eyes.

294
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,720
He's at an abandoned factory
in the suburbs.

295
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,200
Don't tell him I told you!

296
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
What did he say?

297
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,600
He... told you
to take care of yourself.

298
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Scoundrel!

299
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Also,

300
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,359
Ms. Wang got caught
when she delivered the food.

301
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,800
Young Master Chi is on his way.

302
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,000
Should we move to another location?

303
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Don't mind him.

304
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
I've instructed Ms. Wang in advance.

305
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
He can't find this place.

306
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
- Hey, Gang Zi.
- Hello, Young Master Chi.

307
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,120
I'm going to the factory
in the suburbs now.

308
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,936
If you catch the three of them,
bring them to me.

309
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,600
- Okay. No problem.
- All right.

310
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Wei Wei!

311
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Wei Wei!

312
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Wei Wei!

313
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Wei Wei!

314
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Wei Wei!

315
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Darn it.

316
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Wei Wei!

317
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Does it hurt?

318
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,840
It's okay.

319
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
Except for his ankle
and the pulled ligament,

320
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,496
the rest are just
superficial injuries.

321
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,640
He'll be fine in a few days.

322
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Thank you, doctor.

323
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,360
Thank you for coming at this hour.

324
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,840
You're too kind.
It's what I should do, it's my job.

325
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,600
- This way, please.
- See the doctor out.

326
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

327
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Mr. Chi.

328
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,240
Please let me go.

329
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,719
Recently, my company
got a big project.

330
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,760
They can't do it without me.

331
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,120
Isn't Chi Cheng managing
the company for you?

332
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,040
You can take this opportunity...

333
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,400
to rest for a couple of days.

334
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Still...

335
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,040
Still, you can't tire out your son.

336
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,120
Do you not tire him out?

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Chi Cheng's mom...

338
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,360
went abroad to visit
Chi Cheng's sister.

339
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,080
I'm the only one home.

340
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,320
Be my companion.

341
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,400
I'll keep you company?

342
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
What? You don't want to?

343
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
No.

344
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I...

345
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
am...

346
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,720
flattered.

347
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Let's go. Hurry up!

348
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
You were so arrogant just now.

349
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Be quick!

350
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
Hurry up!

351
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Get up!

352
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Squat down.

353
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Squat properly!

354
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Don't move!

355
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
We found them.

356
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Where's my guy?

357
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
He's asking you.

358
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
We... don't know.

359
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,360
After we kidnapped him,

360
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,240
Mr. Chi won't let us
get involved anymore.

361
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
You're all darn useless.

362
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Get up!

363
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,720
What should we do with them?

364
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Send them...

365
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
to whoever hired them.

366
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
All right.

367
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Let's go! Don't move!

368
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,280
Don't freaking move!

369
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Are you crazy?

370
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
You're sending them back?

371
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
What?

372
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,920
Do you want to infuriate
your old man to death?

373
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
I think...

374
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,039
you don't want to go
against him head-on, do you?

375
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,080
Even when a rabbit is cornered,
he'll freaking bite.

376
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,280
I think you don't have
a brain at all.

377
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If you go back now,

378
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,240
you'll be walking into a trap.

379
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,240
Besides, your darling...

380
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,040
is still with your dad.

381
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
Don't get yourself trapped too.

382
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Have a smoke.

383
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm not in the mood.

384
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,040
Come on. Let's go to my place.

385
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
What are you looking at?
Stop looking!

386
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
Squat properly. Squat down.

387
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,600
Chi Cheng must be looking
for me everywhere.

388
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,920
Chi Cheng's facial features
are like his dad's.

389
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,160
But his dad is gentler than him.

390
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,560
Do you sleep with the lights on?

391
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
What are you doing?

392
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,680
Put me out of my misery.

393
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,016
Since you won't put me out
of my misery,

394
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,600
why should I put you out
of your misery?

395
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Mr. Chi.

396
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,080
Can I ask you something?

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Go ahead.

398
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Mr. Chi.

399
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,680
Since you're locking me up here,

400
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,000
why aren't you torturing me?

401
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,960
When I know you well enough,

402
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,360
I'll torture you then.

403
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,160
I already know...

404
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,400
about your family.

405
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Your parents...

406
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
are both upright people.

407
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,080
You have a good character too.

408
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,880
You're a quite honest young man.

409
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,960
Why are you hanging out
with Chi Cheng?

410
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,520
He's not a good guy.

411
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,480
If you're together,
it won't end well.

412
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,200
How can you say that about your son?

413
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,680
Don't think I'm joking with you.

414
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
I know my son best.

415
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,960
You're not the first person
he's dated.

416
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,080
He's a habitual offender.

417
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,480
You're a first-time offender.

418
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,280
There's no hope
for repeat offenders.

419
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
First-time offenders...

420
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,200
still have a chance
to turn over a new leaf.

421
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,880
So what you just said is wrong.

422
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,040
I'm not torturing you.

423
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm saving you.

424
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Thank you, Mr. Chi.

425
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,320
After eating, come home with me.

426
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
What for?

427
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,840
I made such a commotion yesterday.

428
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,400
Chi Cheng must have
found out later on.

429
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,000
He looked around the house,

430
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
but he couldn't find me.

431
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:17,680
He must have thought his dad
sent me somewhere else.

432
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,720
I didn't expect
that after all the twists and turns,

433
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,680
I'd be sent back here again.

434
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,760
When Chi Cheng was little,

435
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,840
this little wastrel...

436
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
was quite cute.

437
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
A DV.

438
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
It's still working.

439
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,000
Let's see what we have.

440
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,879
Look at this kid.

441
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,440
Are you enjoying your stay here?

442
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,600
Isn't this broken?

443
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll take it and throw it away.

444
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Don't throw it away.

445
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,119
I... Look, I just fixed it.

446
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,200
This can still be used too.

447
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
At worst,

448
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
sell it as junk...

449
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,360
for a few dozen yuan.

450
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,600
What a cheapskate.

451
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
Enjoy yourself.

452
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm so bored.

453
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,360
It's so boring.

454
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm so bored.

455
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,800
Wu Suo Wei, where are you?

456
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Five.

457
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Two.

458
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Zero.

459
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Five, twenty.

460
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I love you more.

461
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Wait.

462
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,400
If I can use my watch
to express my love,

463
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,400
can I also send
a hidden signal with my watch?

464
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,200
Let me think.

465
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,120
Nine, five?

466
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Help me.

467
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Nine, five.

468
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Five.

469
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Five.

470
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
I am in...

471
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
At...

472
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,120
What number should I use for that?

473
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,560
That's not right.

474
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
No.

475
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:54,000
- Eight.
- Eight.

476
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
- Eight.
- Eight.

477
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
- Eight.
- Eight.

478
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,680
This is...

479
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,119
Liangxi Street.

480
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Block 520,

481
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
No. 8.

482
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
5208.

483
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Five.

484
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
- Two.
- Two.

485
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Zero.

486
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Eight.

487
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
What does that mean?

488
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
Doesn't he get it?

489
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I'll do it again.

490
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
What are you doing?

491
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Nothing.

492
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
I'm just bored.

493
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Come out for a chat.

494
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Come on.

495
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,520
This...

496
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
(Molten Lava)

497
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,360
looks like my recipe.

498
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Don't worry about the recipe.

499
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
I'll give you a new one.

500
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
This is serious.

501
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,240
I've tried my best.

502
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,680
I really can't tell what it is.

503
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I think...

504
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
sometimes,

505
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
having a high IQ...

506
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
can't be as good
as really knowing the person.

507
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

508
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,840
Five, eight, eight, eight.

509
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,000
Five, eight, eight,

510
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
eight.

511
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Eight...

512
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,760
I'm rich.

513
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,120
Did your dad give him
a lot of money?

514
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,640
Five-twenty is easy to understand.

515
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,520
It's "I love you."

516
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I love you too.

517
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,600
- Go on.
- I get it now.

518
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,560
"I love you. Bye."

519
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,440
So if you connect them,

520
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,320
your dad gave him a lot of money...

521
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
and treats him well.

522
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
You don't have to worry.

523
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Bye.

524
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Awesome.

525
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,600
I'd better go home tomorrow.
