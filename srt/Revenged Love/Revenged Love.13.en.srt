"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 13, Top 10 Best Boyfriend)

3
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
What?

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,720
Have you lied to me?

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Actually,

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
I had an ulterior motive...

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
when I approached you back then.

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
What ulterior motive?

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,600
That's enough.

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,760
Didn't you have a girlfriend
whom you dated for three years?

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,136
She despised the poor
and curried favor with the rich...

12
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,200
and dumped you.

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,760
Then you wanted
to borrow my shoulder...

14
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
to climb on.

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,800
You knew I had a girlfriend
of three years?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Then...

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Then...

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
Do you know who she is?

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
No.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,320
But I don't want to know either.

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Why?

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Because I can't stand that you had
an unforgettable relationship...

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,760
in a history that I can't change.

25
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
Da Wei,
did you tell him the truth or not?

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
I wanted to.

27
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,160
But I couldn't
after hearing what he said.

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Now that I think about it...

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Just forget it.

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,280
I'll leave it at that.

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,480
He and I are
from different worlds anyway.

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,240
Our friends are worlds apart.

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,640
Aside from Guo Cheng Yu,

34
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,440
no one would tell Chi Cheng
about us.

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
That makes sense.

36
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,480
If you can hide it,
it's better not to take the risk.

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,736
When your relationship
becomes stable in the future,

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,160
maybe you can chat...

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,880
and bring it up one day.

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
You're right.

41
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,560
Wei Wei, transfer some money
for my phone bill.

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,640
Can't you reload it yourself?

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,240
Aren't you in charge
of our family's money?

44
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,160
I'm not your family.

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
(Remaining bill,
Pay, Self-defined payment)

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
(Cheng, local user, pay 30 now)

47
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,201
(Pay 30 for Cheng,
confirm payment now)

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,920
I reloaded 30 yuan for you.

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,360
You're so stingy.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,160
It's not about
being stingy or not, okay?

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Chi Cheng is doing this on purpose.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,039
Who calls once they go out...

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,920
and won't hang up
when they have nothing to say?

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,560
Isn't that good?

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,240
He's being clingy
because he loves you.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,080
If you want love wants to last,

57
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,640
there should be give and take.

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,040
You should be clingy to him too.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,759
But I also need my own space.

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,160
We are two guys dating.

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,240
Do we have to be so melodramatic?

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
Do we?

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
You do.

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,480
Can the pants you buy me...

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
go up...

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
one size?

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,680
This is already the biggest size.

68
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Can you return them?

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
It's fine.

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
It's okay.

71
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,440
I'll just...

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,080
pull them down to wear them.

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
Wang Shuo gave you a snake...

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,360
and you kept it for seven years.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,440
I gave you a pair of pants.

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,520
Can you wear them for seven years?

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
If you only give me
this pair of pants,

78
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
I can wear them for life.

79
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,440
Are you saying...

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,136
this pair of pants
isn't good enough...

81
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,640
and you want me to buy another pair?

82
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,040
How much money
do you have in your safe?

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
Don't go after my money.

84
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Wei Wei.

85
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,840
You're really a miser.

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
What do you mean?

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
Not only are you stingy,

88
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
but you even suck money from others.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,280
During the day,

90
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
didn't you say we're not family?

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,840
I can't let you suck money for free.

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
What do you want?

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,359
Wait. I have something to do
at the office tonight.

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,959
- I have to work.
- How can I not know...

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
if there's work at the office?

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
Let go of me. Let go!

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,320
(How two guys can date)

98
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,839
(Can two guys date?
How to make it smoother?)

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,959
Mr. Wu.

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,999
This is the meeting minutes
from our discussion just now...

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
with our new partner.

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,119
Their requirements
are a bit over the budget.

103
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,160
But overall, I think it's doable.

104
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,280
Please take a look.

105
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Mr. Wu.

106
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,279
What nonsense is this?

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
(How two guys can date)

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,240
Do you think the price
they gave still isn't right?

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No.

110
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,080
Hold on.

111
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,776
I don't think there's a problem.

112
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,560
I suggest that we reduce
some mechanical designs.

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,640
This way,
we can control the cost better.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,696
As long as we can give them
the results they want, it's fine.

115
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Okay. I'll keep track of this then.

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Okay.

117
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
(Show true self, let him
get to know your weaknesses)

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,120
Why are you following me?

119
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
Has the company gone bankrupt?

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
As if.

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,640
Our company is on a roll.

122
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,800
So you two had a fight.

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,680
It's the opposite.

124
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,200
We're so in love now.

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,440
Forget about having a fight.
We don't even bicker.

126
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,680
Then why are you frowning here?

127
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Because we're so close,

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,120
I have to hide a bit.

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,480
As you know,
he's so young and vigorous.

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
Whenever he sees me,

131
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,240
he can't control himself.

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Darn it.

133
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,960
He's that passionate?

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
Do you know
what he did to my bedroom?

135
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
What?

136
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
- Look.
- Darn it.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
How fun.

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,000
But let me tell you.

139
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,960
The best way to trap a man...

140
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,640
is not to get him satisfied.

141
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
I want to get him satisfied.

142
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,080
The problem is he can't get enough.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Regarding this matter,

144
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,080
I can't help you.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,000
All right, Ms. Chen.

150
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,360
There's no problem.

151
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,199
When you go home, watch your diet.

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
- Rest well.
- Okay.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,079
All right. Go home safely.

154
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,159
Okay. Thank you.

155
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
- Take this.
- I'll get going.

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,440
- Mr. Li. Here, have a seat.
- Hey.

157
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
All right.

158
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,840
Dr. Jiang, how often do you do this?

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,600
Every two to three months.

160
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,719
- Okay. When you go home...
- Why is there such a long line?

161
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,839
Okay?

162
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,919
Dr. Jiang.

163
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,640
Have you thought
about expanding the clinic?

164
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
I have.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,720
But currently, I'm lacking this.

166
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
Then I hope...

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,400
you can win the lottery soon
and get rich.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,480
Okay, when I get back,
I'll buy a lottery ticket...

169
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
and win five million yuan.

170
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,520
Is that free clinic a scam?

171
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
What?

172
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
Let me tell you.

173
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,720
Dr. Jiang is famous far and wide.

174
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,760
He's a good doctor
who's hard to come by.

175
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Done. It's fine now.

176
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
What?

177
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Young Master Guo.

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
- Mr. Li, claim the masks there.
- Okay.

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
All right.

180
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I'll be right there.

181
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,040
- Thank you.
- Dr. Jiang.

182
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,160
Do you think Guo Cheng Yu likes you?

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Next.

184
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,000
He's not around.

185
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,800
He's been gone for a long time.

186
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
How can he like me?

187
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,559
(I'm busy at work,
so I can't spend time with you)

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
(Remember to eat well)

189
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,200
There he goes again.

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
None of those men...

191
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,960
in the past...

192
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
has tried my cooking.

193
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Then who has?

194
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,080
Their next boyfriend.

195
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
Chi Cheng.

196
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Yes.

197
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,480
The greenery and the liverworts
must be the freshest ones.

198
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Don't plant them,
then pull them out.

199
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,760
Yes. I think this
will make it more comfortable.

200
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,480
Yes. That's good.

201
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,600
Go with this plan.

202
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,056
Then go with whatever's comfortable.

203
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Okay.

204
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
Who are you making more comfortable?

205
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,480
The client...

206
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,520
is requesting a revision.

207
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
We're now back to the first version.

208
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
What are you thinking about?

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm thinking...

210
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,320
that in this beautiful sunset,

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
the person next to me...

212
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,920
didn't shave.

213
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,920
It's an eyesore.

214
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Your godfather is full of hormones.

215
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,040
I shaved this morning.

216
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Who are you calling your son?

217
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,960
Green-Eyed Monster is your brother.

218
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Stop poking me with it.

219
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,680
Stop showing off...

220
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,200
your love here.

221
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,520
It's none of your business.

222
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Sir.

223
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,040
Let me explain.

224
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
Explain what?

225
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,480
You're still poking me.

226
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,239
- That's enough. We're not alone.
- What are you afraid of?

227
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Goodness.

228
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Xiao Shuai.

229
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Xiao Shuai.

230
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
What's wrong?

231
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,200
Did you follow Chi Cheng's car here?

232
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,120
Why would I follow him?

233
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm here to see you.

234
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,640
When Chi Cheng's not here,

235
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,720
you don't come to see me either.

236
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,400
Are you blaming me...

237
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,160
for not visiting you for so long?

238
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Yes.

239
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,520
You haven't been here for so long,

240
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,241
but saw how lovey-dovey they were
as soon as you got here.

241
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,120
Do you feel uncomfortable?

242
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,440
The two of them...

243
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
being lovey-dovey?

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,040
Uncomfortable?

245
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Wait.

246
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,160
Who is being lovey-dovey...

247
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
and making me uncomfortable?

248
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Keep putting on an act.

249
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Keep pretending.

250
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Are you...

251
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,040
Are you...

252
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,120
angry about that night?

253
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
That day,

254
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I didn't touch you.

255
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
I know.

256
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Don't worry.

257
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,080
Before you officially accept me,

258
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,000
I won't do anything to you.

259
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,960
Then we'll see...

260
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
if you're capable
of achieving that or not.

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,920
Do you really think...

262
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,200
I can't do it...

263
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,800
and not that I don't want to?

264
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,800
All you think about is Chi Cheng.

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
Of course you don't want to.

266
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,720
You don't think
I like Chi Cheng, do you?

267
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,720
Don't you?

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,519
But I advise you to stop quickly.

269
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,760
Right now, Chi Cheng
likes Da Wei too much.

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,840
You two are both tops.

271
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
It's not compatible.

272
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm getting off work.

273
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
You should go home first.

274
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,680
I should go home first?

275
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
I...

276
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,000
(Xiao Shuai, look at this.
He's such a jerk)

277
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
What's wrong?

278
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,520
(Meng Tao)

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll get going.

280
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Xiao Shuai.

281
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Stop drinking.

282
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
You...

283
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
You look like Guo Cheng Yu.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What do you think?

285
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,600
Am I handsome?

286
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,920
Yes, you're quite handsome.

287
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
As if.

288
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,080
Give me a drink.

289
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Xiao Shuai.

290
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Stop drinking.

291
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,120
Let me be!

292
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,640
Leave me alone!

293
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,160
It's not my fault.

294
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
It's not.

295
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
It's not.

296
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
It has nothing to do with you.

297
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
- It's not your fault.
- It's not my fault.

298
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
- It's okay.
- It's not my fault.

299
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,720
It's not your fault.

300
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,640
Don't think about it anymore
after crying it out.

301
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,320
Don't look at my password.

302
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
Slow down.

303
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,200
This is my house.

304
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,960
I know the way.

305
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Come on.

306
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Be careful.

307
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Watch your head.

308
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,320
Slowly.

309
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Give me a drink.

310
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,040
Okay. I'll get some drinks.

311
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Wait for me.

312
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
Liquor.

313
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,079
Here's the liquor.

314
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,280
Liquor.

315
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
- Slowly.
- I want to drink liquor.

316
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,679
Slowly. Here, cheers.

317
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,080
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Be careful. Slowly.

319
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
What's the matter?

320
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,840
Why are you doing this to me?

321
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
What am I doing to you?

322
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,880
Don't be so nice to me.

323
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Why?

324
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Because...

325
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Because...

326
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
My goodness.

327
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,480
It's gone.

328
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
How much...

329
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,280
did I drink yesterday?

330
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,680
Apologize.

331
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,760
Make him apologize to me.

332
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
Apologize.

333
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Apologize.

334
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,440
Apologize.

335
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,920
- Apologize.
- I apologize.

336
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I apologize.

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
My goodness.

338
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
You're awake.

339
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Come on.

340
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,201
Go and drink some hangover soup.

341
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,920
I also prepared breakfast for you.

342
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Here.

343
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,920
Have some milk.

344
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,400
How are you feeling?
Does your head still hurt?

345
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
If you don't move it, it won't hurt.

346
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,000
If it doesn't hurt, don't drink it.

347
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm going to drink it.

348
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Let me ask you.

349
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
Yesterday,
did I keep talking nonsense?

350
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,440
You didn't talk nonsense.

351
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,800
You just kept saying...

352
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,040
that I'm tall,

353
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
handsome,

354
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
considerate,

355
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,680
and treat you really well.

356
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Compared to when you're sober,

357
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,680
you're much more honest.

358
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,320
I can't drink anymore.

359
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,120
You wanted to come out...

360
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,119
to go shopping?

361
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,400
Yes. I looked it up.

362
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,680
When people date, they go shopping.

363
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,560
We can't continue staying at home.

364
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,160
You're going to kill me.

365
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,560
(Top 10 Romantic Date Places
for Couples)

366
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,640
That's what straight people do.

367
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,960
Stop looking at your phone.

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Talk to me for a while.

369
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,200
Give it to me.

370
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,440
Sir, this is a magical couple watch.

371
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,000
Look, when the time
on one watch is adjusted,

372
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,560
the hands of the other watch
move too.

373
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,959
Even if you're thousands
of miles apart,

374
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
both watches can move
at the same time.

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Isn't that magical?

376
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,040
It's true. Look at this.

377
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,080
He doesn't like it. Thank you.

378
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,880
- Who likes you?
- You.

379
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
- How do I like you?
- Look at your hand.

380
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Wait for me.

381
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
- I'm going to the restroom.
- Okay. Go ahead.

382
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,000
Isn't the restroom at...

383
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,960
Just say you want
to buy the watches.

384
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,280
What a cliché excuse.

385
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
You're back.

386
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Let's go.

387
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
What's wrong?

388
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,440
Did you really go to the restroom?

389
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
What else?

390
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Let's go.

391
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
I'll buy you a jacket.

392
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Come on.

393
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,880
You really bought it?

394
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,160
How did you put it on me?

395
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,760
Do you think you're the only one
with some tricks?

396
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,400
It's time to buy me clothes.

397
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
I'll buy them.

398
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Let's go.

399
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Come on.

400
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Today, I'm going to exhaust
all his energy.

401
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,840
Didn't you say you're going
to buy me clothes?

402
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,360
Why did you bring me here?

403
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,080
Let's exercise first.

404
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Open your arms.

405
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,360
Inhale.

406
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,000
Exhale.

407
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,680
Come on. Let's go and warm up.

408
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Okay.

409
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
We...

410
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
We'll see.

411
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
You,

412
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,840
swim 20 laps first.

413
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,880
Okay.

414
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Let's hug for a while.

415
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:01,719
What...

416
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,960
What are you doing?

417
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,440
People are watching.

418
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
I know.

419
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,120
I just want to cling to you.

420
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
Back then, Yue and I...

421
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
"Yue" what?

422
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm starting to think
you're frivolous.

423
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
I've always been frivolous.

424
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,080
Let go.

425
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Wu Suo Wei.

426
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
Wu Suo Wei!

427
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Wu Suo Wei.

428
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,960
Wu Suo Wei.

429
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,440
Hello? The stuff has arrived?

430
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
All right.

431
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay. I'll go back now.

432
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Okay.

433
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,440
Let's go.

434
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Come to the office first.
I'll talk to you tonight.

435
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,200
Can we go home now?

436
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,560
I...

437
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,256
I just remembered
that there's an emergency at work.

438
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,600
I have to go and take care of it.

439
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll drive you
and work overtime with you then.

440
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,240
There's no need.
I can handle it myself.

441
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I'll get going.

442
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Gang Zi.

443
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,120
Wake up.
Play one more round with me.

444
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,000
I really can't play anymore.

445
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,320
Wu Suo Wei's not coming home yet?

446
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,520
What time is it now?

447
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,560
It's 12am.

448
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,360
It's still early then.

449
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,280
He leaves early every day
and comes home late.

450
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,640
He's so focused on work.

451
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,200
Is your company that busy?

452
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,040
There has been a lot of work lately.

453
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,240
However,

454
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,760
he doesn't have to sleep
in the office every day.

455
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,480
Would he cheat on you...

456
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
at the office...

457
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
behind your back?

458
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,320
No way.

459
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,680
He doesn't have the guts to do that.

460
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,840
He doesn't have the guts,

461
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
but he's so handsome...

462
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,840
with his sparkling eyes.

463
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,040
Other people might have the guts.

464
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,160
I think this
will make it more comfortable.

465
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,520
That's good. Go with this plan.

466
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,000
Then go with whatever's comfortable.

467
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Okay.

468
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,080
Who are you making more comfortable?

469
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,320
The client...

470
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
is requesting a revision.

471
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,880
We're now back to the first version.

472
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,800
I'll treat you to a meal
another day.

473
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,480
You can come to the office today?

474
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,240
- Okay.
- Let's go.

475
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Come to the office first.
I'll talk to you tonight.

476
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,279
I...

477
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,856
I just remembered
that there's an emergency at work.

478
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,200
I have to go and take care of it.

479
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,320
I'll drive you
and work overtime with you then.

480
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,800
There's no need.
I can handle it myself.

481
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
I'll get going.

482
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Come on.

483
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,120
Let's catch them red-handed.

484
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Hurry up.

485
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,480
Darn you!

486
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Gang Zi.

487
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Go over there.

488
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,840
Darn it! Why are you here?

489
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,160
Am I not allowed to be here?

490
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,640
Well, not really.

491
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
What's this?

492
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,440
This is the vivarium I made
for Green-Eyed Monster.

493
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,039
The one I made before
didn't have enough materials,

494
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,400
so it was quite small
and uncomfortable.

495
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
Now that I have enough materials...

496
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,960
and there's a lot of space
in the new house,

497
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,960
I want to make a new one
for Green-Eyed Monster.

498
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,999
Look, this old log, the leaves,
and this wood.

499
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,840
Look at this skeleton.

500
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,440
Doesn't it look
like a condensed rainforest?

501
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
I've looked up
Green-Eyed Monster's species.

502
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm sure he'll like it.

503
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,160
Are you stupid?

504
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,040
Does it hurt?

505
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
No.

506
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,280
I just need to put on a Band-Aid
for a couple of days.

507
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,360
I was wondering why you've been
sneaking around these past few days.

508
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I'm sorry.

510
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,000
Chi Cheng.

511
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,840
Right now, I'm not used
to a same-gender relationship yet.

512
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
But I'm smart.

513
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,640
I'm sure that in no time,

514
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,520
I'll become
one of the top 10 best boyfriends.

515
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
You...

516
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,360
already are.

517
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,840
Cheater! Take this!

518
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
It's okay.

519
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Don't mind him.
