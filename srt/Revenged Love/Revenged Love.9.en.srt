(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 9, Snakes
Aren't More Important Than People)

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,000
- Hello?
- Chairman.

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,599
There's trouble at the snake den.

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,160
Dozens of snakes
were bitten to death.

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,400
How did they get bitten to death?

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,160
Maybe they didn't get along well.

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,720
There are too many snake breeds
being kept together.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,640
Without professional caretakers,

10
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,399
snakes are prone to issues.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
Why don't we move them
somewhere else?

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,280
I'll get someone
to take them out tomorrow.

13
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,000
Send a few more people there.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Transport the snakes out
before dawn.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,520
Remember to keep it quiet.

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
What's this?

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Look.

18
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,600
Doesn't it look like you?

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,760
It looks exactly like you.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
How childish.

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
No, it looks like you.

22
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,480
Look.

23
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
It looks just like you.

24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Stop playing with it.

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
It's 11pm.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Let's go to bed.

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay.

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Let's sleep.

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,720
Let's go to bed.

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,520
Actually, I quite like you.

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
What are you doing?

32
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Nothing.

33
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Are you going to sleep?

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If not, I'll leave.

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Don't go.

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
I'll sleep.

37
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll sleep.

38
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
It's okay.

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I need to take this call.

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Go back to sleep.

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,880
- Hello?
- Mr. Chi, can you talk now?

42
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Go ahead.

43
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
We have a situation.

44
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,079
A white van entered the base.

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,040
The van is sealed.
A lot of people were in it.

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,920
I think this vehicle went in
to take the snakes out.

47
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm guarding with my men
by the roadside now.

48
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
We'll make a move
as soon as the vehicle gets here.

49
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Okay.

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll be right there.

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,640
- Be careful.
- Okay.

52
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Da Bao.

53
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
You've been aggrieved for so long.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,320
When I get the snakes back,

55
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,640
I won't let you suffer anymore.

56
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
Why is he in such a hurry to leave?

57
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,559
- Hello?
- Wu.

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,479
A white van is entering
the Storage Base.

59
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,559
We suspect
it's taking the snakes out.

60
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,679
Should we take action?

61
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
No rush.

62
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,440
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

63
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
That's the vehicle. Stop him.

64
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,600
I didn't tell so many people
to come.

65
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,640
Where did they come from?

66
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Get them!

67
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,680
You've been staying put, right?

68
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Yes.

69
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,719
Okay. When Guo Cheng Yu comes,
while they're fighting,

70
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,880
we'll get a huge advantage.

71
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
He's already here.

72
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,640
They're fighting. Don't you see?

73
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,560
Guo Cheng Yu is here.

74
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,640
Darn it, Chi Cheng is here too.

75
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,120
This is my first time
falling for a guy.

76
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,040
- Why are you here?
- To watch the show.

77
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Darn you!

78
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Let's take the snakes!

79
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,240
- Hurry, move them.
- Hurry up!

80
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Here.

81
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,239
Li Wang, what are you doing?

82
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,559
- Taking the snakes, of course.
- Stay the heck out of this.

83
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,840
How dare you hit me?

84
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,039
Young Master Chi.

85
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Yellow Dragon.

86
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Let's go home.

87
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,199
Keep an eye out first.
Let's go, guys.

88
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Take the snakes with me!

89
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,720
Come on, guys. Let's go!

90
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Wait for me.

91
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,240
- Hurry up. Take these.
- Be careful.

92
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
One.

93
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Two.

94
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Three.

95
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Four.

96
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Five.

97
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,160
Hurry.

98
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
Why is he here?

99
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Hurry.

100
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Da Bao!

101
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,040
Don't move around!

102
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,400
- Da Bao.
- Wu Suo Wei.

103
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Don't move.

104
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Yellow Dragon.

105
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Listen to me.

106
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Be good.

107
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Let go.

108
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,480
Let go.

109
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Let go.

110
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Good boy.

111
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Very good.

112
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Yellow Dragon.

113
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,360
Da Wei!

114
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
Chi Cheng! Kill the snake!

115
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,920
Yellow Dragon is meaningful
to Chi Cheng.

116
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,800
You can't kill it.

117
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Chi...

118
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
likes...

119
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
snakes.

120
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
I'm the Yellow Dragon.

121
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,400
Green-Eyed Monster is you.

122
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,080
Why am I Green-Eyed Monster?

123
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
You like to get jealous.

124
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,640
Chi Cheng!

125
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
What are you still hesitating about?

126
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,080
Who's more important,
him or the snake?

127
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Da Bao.

128
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
Da Bao.

129
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,960
Hang in there.

130
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll take you to the hospital now.

131
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Da Wei.

132
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,880
- Stop it.
- Da Wei!

133
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,999
Hang in there.

134
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,240
Da Bao!

135
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,760
(Under Emergency Treatment)

136
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
I'll take care...

137
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,400
of Yellow Dragon's body for you.

138
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
Do whatever you want.

139
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
You've really changed.

140
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,280
Aren't you glad?

141
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I...

142
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,560
(Emergency Treatment Area,
Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out)

143
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
Doctor, how is he?

144
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,360
The patient is out of danger.

145
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,840
But we still need
to observe him for a while.

146
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,520
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

147
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,960
I'll drive you home first.

148
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,400
Come back tomorrow morning.

149
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
It's okay.

150
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:16,640
I want to stay here.

151
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,800
I'll stay with him by myself.

152
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
No.

153
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,360
I want to be the first person
Da Wei sees when he wakes up.

154
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
Then I can't let you stay here,
all the more.

155
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,960
- Let's go.
- Guo Cheng Yu.

156
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
What are you doing?

157
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Young Master Guo.

158
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
How's Jiang Xiao Shuai?

159
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
He's asleep.

160
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,440
From what I saw today,

161
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,200
it seems like Chi Cheng
has fallen for him.

162
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,040
But that's a good thing.

163
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,960
It's been six years.
It's time to move on.

164
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,839
With his new love,

165
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,120
I don't think he'll steal
people you like anymore.

166
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,760
You can boldly
have a relationship now.

167
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
I've never cared...

168
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
about him stealing my guys.

169
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,240
It was just a game.

170
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,080
All these years,

171
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
he hasn't been happy.

172
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,000
I was just playing along with him.

173
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
Then Jiang Xiao Shuai
is part of your game too.

174
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,920
Since Chi Cheng
won't steal him anymore,

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,159
you don't need...

176
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,639
to hang onto the stubborn
Jiang Xiao Shuai anymore.

177
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
You're just causing
yourself trouble anyway.

178
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Let's go.

179
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,480
How is he?

180
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm just waiting for him to wake up.

181
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,040
Did you really stay up all night?

182
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,240
That snake...

183
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,560
was quite important to you, right?

184
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,000
I thought you two
were just fooling around.

185
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,439
Did he tell you
we were just fooling around?

186
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,280
No. He's very serious about you.

187
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,720
Very serious.

188
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,680
Who's Wu Suo Wei's family?

189
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,480
- I am.
- Come with me.

190
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,760
Why aren't they here yet?

191
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,480
Is the snake dead or not?

192
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,520
Is the snake dead?

193
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Ms. Yue.

194
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
You shouldn't have spent
so much money.

195
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,960
What do you mean?

196
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,439
I don't understand
what you're saying.

197
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
You don't understand?

198
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,519
Young Master Chi knows
all the tricks...

199
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,120
you pulled behind his back.

200
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Young Master Chi asked me
to inform you...

201
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,120
that it's over between you two!

202
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Xiao Gang!

203
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,760
This is a misunderstanding.
I can explain.

204
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Da Wei.

205
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,960
Xiao Shuai.

206
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
You're awake.

207
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,240
How do you feel?

208
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Do you want some water?

209
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,880
Where's the merchant?

210
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,280
Did you get...

211
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
my money back?

212
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,679
Don't worry.

213
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,920
He was caught yesterday.

214
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,680
I asked around.

215
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,319
Your direct and indirect losses...

216
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,919
are 200,000 yuan.

217
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,080
Two hundred thousand yuan?

218
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,960
There's also compensation.

219
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,360
If you add it all up,

220
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
kid,

221
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,880
you'll make a fortune.

222
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,160
It's so-so.

223
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Where's Chi Cheng?

224
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,880
He's out there listening
to the doctor's instructions.

225
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,080
Adversity allows one
to see true feelings indeed.

226
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,000
Mr. Macho watched
over you all day and night.

227
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
And for your sake,

228
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,440
he killed his beloved snake for you.

229
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,560
You have to make it up to him.

230
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Well...

231
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,800
His snake hurt me first.

232
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,240
Why should I make it up to him?

233
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,320
Just drink your water.

234
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,880
Xiao Shuai.

235
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
With you around,
I feel so reassured.

236
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,040
Thank you.

237
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Wei Wei.

238
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
You're awake.

239
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
I'm awake.

240
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
Does your neck still hurt?

241
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
My neck doesn't hurt.

242
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,720
But my chest hurts.

243
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
How can it not hurt
when you have broken bones?

244
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
I'm sorry.

245
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,080
What are you sorry for?

246
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,880
You didn't hurt me.

247
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
If I killed it earlier,

248
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,120
you wouldn't have
gotten hurt so badly.

249
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,519
He was your beloved pet, after all.

250
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Wei Wei.

251
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I promise.

252
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,680
In the future,
I won't let you get hurt again.

253
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,680
Will there be a future for us?

254
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,200
Because of this,

255
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,480
he said he wanted
to break up with me.

256
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Msr. Chi.

257
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,360
Actually, I'm quite afraid
of snakes.

258
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,920
But to accommodate Chi Cheng,
I didn't dare to say it.

259
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,679
I used to have dogs and cats too.

260
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,720
I know how it feels when a pet dies.

261
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,560
But I had no choice.

262
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Last time,
on the business trip with him,

263
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,640
when he went
to answer a call that night,

264
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,880
the snake and I were the only
ones left in the room.

265
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,080
I don't know how I provoked it.

266
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,480
It jumped on me and bit me.

267
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
Mrs. Chi.

268
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,479
It hurts.

269
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,160
I understand you, Yue Yue.

270
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm afraid of snakes too.

271
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,320
When I see that thing,

272
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
I get goosebumps all over.

273
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,960
Because of that,

274
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,720
I don't dare to visit him.

275
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,160
Chi Cheng has never been aggrieved
since he was little.

276
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
But because of those snakes,

277
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,320
he lives in that crappy basement.

278
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,960
Mrs. Chi, I'm fine now.

279
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,920
I feel much better
after talking to you.

280
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,520
Please don't tell Chi Cheng
that I came to see you.

281
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
I don't want him
to think I'm a gossip.

282
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
I should still talk to him.

283
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,840
Mrs. Chi.

284
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,440
Don't do that.

285
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,039
It was my fault.

286
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,240
Please don't fight with Chi Cheng
because of me.

287
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I'll make sure
you get an explanation.

288
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,920
You're so nice, Mrs. Chi.

289
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,520
All right.

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,600
Let me take a look. Gosh.

291
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Does it still hurt?

292
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Jia Li.

293
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,600
I heard you guys broke up.

294
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,960
Don't use your ties with us
for personal gain anymore.

295
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,440
Chi Cheng and I
are just having an argument.

296
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,760
I'll visit Mrs. Chi often
from now on.

297
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
She treats me like her own daughter,

298
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,520
so you're my big sister.

299
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,240
You're still putting on an act.

300
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Fine.

301
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,280
Keep acting then.

302
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,160
Don't show your true colors.

303
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,360
This tea is good.

304
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,840
Here, raise your hand.

305
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
It's okay.

306
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,800
- It's done.
- Mr. Chi.

307
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
The chairman is here.

308
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,320
Go do what you have to do.

309
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I have nothing to do.

310
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,080
Tell him I'm not here.

311
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,840
He saw your car.

312
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,160
Tell him you drove it here.

313
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,040
My car is parked next to yours.

314
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Can't you see I'm busy?

315
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,840
The chairman has been here twice.

316
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,520
How's your friend?

317
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Not too bad.

318
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,520
You can keep the snakes.

319
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,480
You can quit your job too.

320
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,320
But don't lose
my daughter-in-law, okay?

321
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,680
You can reconcile with Yue Yue...

322
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,200
or find another one.

323
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Anyway, you must have a woman
around you.

324
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,240
You're always hanging out
with a bunch of punks.

325
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Is that appropriate?

326
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,080
You lost over 50 of my snakes.

327
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,440
I lost one of your daughters-in-law.

328
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
It's not too much, isn't it?

329
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,920
Don't play games with me.

330
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
Save it.

331
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Fine.

332
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,160
Let's talk about something
more practical.

333
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,200
Give me back those 50 snakes...

334
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,000
and I'll give you back
your daughter-in-law.

335
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,280
I won't be able
to get the snakes back.

336
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,280
I can give you money.

337
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,320
Why don't I give you money?

338
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
You...

339
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,800
Are you trying to piss me off?

340
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Let me tell you.

341
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,320
It's impossible for me
to reconcile with Yue Yue.

342
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
You...

343
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
By the way,

344
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,800
one more thing.

345
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,800
I really don't want
to work for the group anymore.

346
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
I'm going to start
a business with a friend...

347
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,920
and open an art
installation company.

348
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,920
An art company?

349
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,240
That doesn't sound reliable at all.

350
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,239
Who knows if you'll continue
to fool around...

351
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,320
under the guise
of opening a company?

352
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,560
Just wait and see.

353
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,160
I bought some snacks.
Take them up to him.

354
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,840
I'm afraid he won't like
the hospital's nutritional meal.

355
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,280
What are you thinking about?

356
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,879
I've been thinking.

357
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,960
Ms. Yue doesn't like
Green-Eyed Monster.

358
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,600
Why didn't she try
to kill it earlier?

359
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,719
You've been with her for so long
and Mrs. Chi didn't try...

360
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,040
to bring you two together.

361
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,000
But why is she in such a hurry
to bring you two together lately?

362
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,400
These two things are so unusual.

363
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,960
And they happened one after another.

364
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,760
Don't you think
there's a mastermind behind this?

365
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,799
I checked our snakes too.

366
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,039
Excluding the 20 that we replaced,

367
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,520
there were more snakes
replaced by someone else.

368
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,719
Don't you think the timing...

369
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,960
of Wu Suo Wei's appearance
is too coincidental each time?

370
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,319
- Wu...
- Don't you think...

371
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,720
you're too talkative today?

372
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Gang Zi.

373
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
You're not the only one
with a brain.

374
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,240
Just keep these things to yourself.
You don't have to say it out loud.

375
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,520
Are you afraid others
won't understand it?

376
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Then...

377
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,800
I know very well...

378
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,520
what his motive is.

379
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,839
No, you already...

380
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
That's enough.

381
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Go now.

382
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I'll get going.

383
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,040
You know it all.

384
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
You need brains to love.

385
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,840
He's lovesick.

386
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
At this point in the game,

387
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,200
Chi Cheng will definitely
break up with Yue Yue.

388
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,120
Next,

389
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,040
it's time for Chi Cheng's mom...

390
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,880
to see Yue Yue's true colors.

391
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Time to eat.

392
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,400
Someone's meal of love.

393
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Xiao Gang.

394
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Yes?

395
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,680
Please do me a favor.

396
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,480
This might be a bit wicked.

397
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,600
Will you help me?

398
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,920
Tell me what it is first.

399
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Come here.

400
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Come here.

401
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Has Yue Yue been
pestering Chi Cheng lately?

402
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,160
She keeps calling Young Master Chi.

403
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,120
If he doesn't pick up, she calls me.

404
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I'm sick of it.

405
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,480
Do you think
she's really repentant...

406
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,240
for hiring people
to kill Green-Eyed Monster?

407
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
That's hard to say.

408
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Why don't we...

409
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,320
let Chi Cheng's family be the judge?

410
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
What do you mean?

411
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,520
When Yue Yue comes to see you again,

412
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,720
give her Chi Cheng's card.

413
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,720
If Yue Yue is truly repentant,

414
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
she won't take the money.

415
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
But if she feels it's justified
to use Chi Cheng's money...

416
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
like she used to,

417
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,880
find a way to let Chi Cheng's mom
know about this...

418
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,320
to let her see
Yue Yue's true colors.

419
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,680
Chi Cheng
will be yours sooner or later.

420
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Gang Zi.

421
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,600
I have my reasons
for doing that to the snake.

422
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,960
Can you let me see Chi Cheng again?

423
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Ms. Yue.

424
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,480
This...

425
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,600
is inappropriate.

426
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,640
I've already said
everything I needed to say.

427
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
This is Young Master Chi's.

428
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,639
I've put in so many emotions...

429
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,080
and suffered so much.

430
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,440
I deserve this money.

431
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,800
Anyway, Chi Cheng's mom
is still on my side.

432
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,479
After pretending to be pitiful,

433
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,960
she softened up.

434
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,200
I don't believe Chi Cheng
can win against his mom.

435
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,760
I'll be the daughter-in-law
of the Chi family sooner or later.

436
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Card payment.

437
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Okay.

438
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Here you go.

439
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
Take it. Let's go to the next one.

440
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,560
Yue Yue, where did you get
so much money?

441
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,959
It's from my ex-boyfriend.
It's a waste not to spend it.

442
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,040
It's so nice
to have a rich ex-boyfriend.

443
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
Here you go.

444
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Ms. Jia Li.

445
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,280
There's a good
French restaurant here.

446
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,000
I'll take you there later.

447
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Okay.

448
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
It's Yue Yue.

449
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,999
- Let's buy from each store.
- Okay.

450
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,359
Didn't she say
she was just an office worker?

451
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,959
To buy a scarf
for her future mother-in-law,

452
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,600
didn't she need to pinch pennies?

453
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,920
Gang Zi, investigate Yue Yue's
spending records in this mall.

454
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,400
I want to see where
all this money is coming from.

455
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
All right.

456
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,200
This is your down-to-earth
daughter-in-law-to-be.

457
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,600
She spent over 336,000 yuan a day.

458
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,160
Do you know whose money she spent?

459
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,400
Wipe your presbyopic eyes clearly
and take a good look.

460
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,320
The main card belongs to your son.

461
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,319
She already broke up
with Chi Cheng a long time ago.

462
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,079
How dare she use his money this way?

463
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,600
When they were together,
she must have lived in luxury.

464
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
And this scarf.

465
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,760
She said she bought it for you
with half a month's salary.

466
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,720
Mom.

467
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,200
She hasn't worked for months.
How can she get a salary?

468
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,840
It's all your son's money.

469
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
You must be hungry.

470
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Yes.

471
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,680
Don't even think about it.

472
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Why not?

473
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Eat that.

474
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,120
There's meat in here too.

475
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
And it's high-quality protein.

476
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,120
It's more nutritious than mine.

477
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,560
I don't want to eat this.

478
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,999
I want to eat yours.

479
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,680
You can't eat this.

480
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
It's spicy.

481
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,920
Your wound just healed.

482
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,320
You need to be careful.

483
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,480
You know I can't eat it,
but you still bought it.

484
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
I want to make you crave it.

485
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,160
What's wrong with that?

486
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Here.

487
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Just a small bite.

488
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Okay.

489
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,840
No. 6, It's time to change
your dressing.

490
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
Come on, lift your butt.

491
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,239
- Help him.
- Okay.

492
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
I'll do it.

493
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,160
Is this okay, doctor?

494
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
That's fine too. Come on.

495
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,959
Doctor, be gentle.

496
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
It's okay.

497
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
It's fine.

498
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,920
Endure it a bit.

499
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
Almost done.

500
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,080
- It's done.
- It's done.

501
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,480
Mrs. Chi, I'm here
to visit you again.

502
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,920
I'm so bored at home alone.

503
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,880
You don't think
I'm annoying, do you?

504
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,400
Yue Yue, you and Chi Cheng
already broke up.

505
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,840
We should stay away from each other.

506
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,600
Mrs. Chi.

507
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
What's wrong?

508
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,760
And this scarf.

509
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,240
Take it back too.

510
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,640
I can't accept
such an expensive gift.

511
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,600
- Mrs. Chi.
- Ms. Wang.

512
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,560
- Mrs. Chi.
- See her out.

513
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,000
Ms. Yue, this way, please.

514
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
This way, please.

515
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
(Open for business)

516
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,880
Dr. Xiao Shuai.

517
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,880
- I'm leaving. Bye.
- Bye.

518
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,599
Thank you for today, Dr. Xiao Shuai.

519
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
It's okay.

520
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,879
- Thank you.
- Don't get into a fight again.

521
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,679
- Get some rest when you get home.
- Okay.

522
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,840
- Thank you.
- Bye.

523
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
It's time for a massage.

524
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,840
How long has it been
since he came here?

525
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,360
(Guo Cheng Yu)

526
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
That makes sense.

527
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,000
He must have found someone new.

528
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,840
That's good too.

529
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
From now on,

530
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,760
I'll have more peace and quiet.
