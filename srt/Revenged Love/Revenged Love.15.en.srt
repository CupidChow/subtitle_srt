(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,880
(Episode 15, Who Can Resist the One
You Love But Can't Have)

3
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
Why did you leave
so suddenly back then?

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,480
Why were you gone for seven years?

5
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,920
You had the nerve to sleep with him.

6
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,960
But you were embarrassed to stay
and demean yourself.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
Since you left,
why did you come back?

8
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
I had the nerve,

9
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
but I didn't have the guts.

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,560
I was afraid
you'd kill me if I stayed.

11
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
I don't even freaking want
to kill you.

12
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
I think you're dirty.

13
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm proud to be tainted by you.

14
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Please, Young Master Chi,
sleep with me just this once.

15
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
You're a freaking jerk!

16
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
You're right.

17
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I am a jerk.

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
I was the one who ran away.

19
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,320
And I'm the one who missed you
for the past seven years.

20
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,280
I guess you spoiled me.

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,320
No one can satisfy me anymore.

22
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
Please, Young Master Chi,
satisfy me just this once.

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Leave him to me.

24
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll deal with him.

25
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm sorry for the trouble.

26
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm home.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
You're back.

28
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Why are you blowing so many?

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,480
I want to blow one...

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,000
for every snake species
in your shop...

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,200
and make...

32
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
a set.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,720
How did you come up with this idea?

34
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,840
Nothing. I just think it's fun.

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Okay.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
I'll wash up first.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,840
- Take this medicine on time.
- Da Wei.

38
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,760
What must you tell me in person?

39
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,440
It's important.

40
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
I heard Wang Shuo is hospitalized.

41
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Why is he in the hospital?

42
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,960
I don't know the exact reason.

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
Guo Cheng Yu
told me once about it.

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
Why don't you visit him?

45
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,360
I'll check on him?

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
What kind of nonsense is that?

47
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,640
Sit down first.

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Why can't you visit him?

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
You can go...

50
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
as Chi Cheng's boyfriend.

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,560
That's perfect.
Proclaim your ownership.

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,200
He didn't say
he'd reconcile with him.

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,440
Why should I look for trouble?

54
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,040
Why did he come back if he didn't
want to reconcile with him?

55
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
He was doing fine abroad.

56
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
Once he came back,
he stayed for half a year.

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Half a year?

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,920
Tell me if he doesn't have
the intention to do that.

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
He hasn't shown up for half a year.

61
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,000
He really hid well.

62
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
It's one thing
if he has that intention.

63
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm just afraid
he's not capable enough to do it.

64
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,000
You're quite confident.

65
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Anyway, I'm not going.

66
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
I'm not interested in him.

67
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,079
Hello. Excuse me.

68
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
Which room is Wang Shuo in?

69
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,280
- Hold on. I'll check for you.
- Okay.

70
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
He's in Room 309.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,559
Walk straight in there,
it's the second room from the back.

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,640
Okay. Thank you.

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
You're welcome.

74
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
A pair of kings.

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
- A pair of deuces.
- A pair of deuces?

76
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,400
Let me think.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,280
Let me think.

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Killer move.

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
What do you think?

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
- Wang Shuo has a lot of energy.
- Come on.

81
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
- He doesn't look sick at all.
- Let's play again.

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Xiao Wang, you're so good
at playing cards.

83
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm just lucky.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,240
- No, you have to play again.
- I'm leaving.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
It's okay.

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Are you looking for someone?

88
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
I...

89
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Wang...

90
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Wang...

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Wang...

92
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,040
Wang...I...

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I've visited him already.

94
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,319
I have to go.

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I'll get going.

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,080
Isn't this Chi Cheng's new car?

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hello?

98
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Where are you?

99
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
I'm out with a client.

100
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
Let's talk later.

101
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
By the way,

102
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,280
I have a meeting tonight.

103
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I might be home late.

104
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
- Mrs. Wu.
- Xiao Chi.

105
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,160
Did Da Qiong call you just now?

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Yes.

107
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,400
You didn't tell him
I'm here, did you?

108
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,720
No. Don't worry.

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
This time,

110
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,920
I don't know why it's so serious.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
If I didn't vomit bile,

112
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,880
I wouldn't have bothered you...

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,160
to come with me
to the hospital for a checkup.

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm just afraid of delaying
my illness.

115
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,240
It'll be more troublesome then.

116
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,120
Don't think too much, Mrs. Wu.

117
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
It's no trouble at all.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,839
Besides, I'm in charge
of external affairs in the company.

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,880
I can come out anytime.

120
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
No. 127 can do the consultation.

121
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,159
Mrs. Wu, sit down and rest.

122
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I'll go.

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Okay.

124
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,080
Is the patient your mom?

125
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Yes.

126
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Doctor.

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,440
My mom isn't seriously ill,
is she?

128
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
You have to be prepared.

129
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Her condition is not optimistic.

130
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,720
The preliminary diagnosis...

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
is pancreatic cancer.

132
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,200
After the biopsy,

133
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
we found...

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,960
that it has spread
to the lymph nodes,

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,280
liver, and gall bladder.

136
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,520
The prognosis is not good.

137
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,400
Surgery is meaningless now.

138
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,880
(Pathology Examination Report)

139
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,280
Pancreatic cancer?

140
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Doctor.

141
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,120
Is there anything else...

142
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
we can do?

143
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,080
To make her suffer less...

144
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
and prolong her life.

145
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,159
Compared to other malignant tumors,

146
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,479
this kind of cancer...

147
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
is not as effective with treatment.

148
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,400
And she's old.

149
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,440
Chemotherapy might
mentally burden her...

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,800
and backfire.

151
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,599
So it's better...

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,400
to reduce the patient's pain...

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,520
and improve her quality of life.

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
The family members...

155
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,400
should spend more time with her.

156
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Perhaps this way,

157
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,400
she can live longer.

158
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,640
I understand.

159
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Doctor.

160
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
Please still check
and see if there's...

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,320
a better treatment method.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
We'll do our best to cooperate.

163
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Please, Doctor.

164
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Xiao Chi.

165
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,840
Don't tell Da Qiong yet.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
If he finds out,

167
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,640
he'll be miserable from now on.

168
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
My son,

169
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,320
you're finally back.

170
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,760
You're fine.
You told me you were dying.

171
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Aren't you cursing yourself?

172
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
If I didn't say I'm sick,

173
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,000
will you come home?

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,240
Liar! You liar!

175
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
You lied to me!

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,240
It's so late. Why are you still up?

177
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,400
So you know it's late too.

178
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Where did you go?

179
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
I told you.

180
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,520
I was with a client.

181
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,480
What a difficult client.

182
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
You've been with the client
until this hour.

183
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Yes.

184
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,440
Whatever the client says,

185
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,560
I don't dare to disagree.

186
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,000
The client won't let me leave.

187
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,800
I can only stay with them.

188
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm sleeping at the clinic.

189
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Wei Wei.

190
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,560
I won't make you wait
this late again.

192
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,280
Don't try to trick me.

195
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,920
Let me sleep for a while.

196
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,440
The calmer the enemy is,

197
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,000
the more I can't panic.

198
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,160
Didn't he just stay in the hospital
in the hospital for a while?

199
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,520
Didn't they just catch up?

200
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
I can treat this as a reward to you.

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720
But I can't be angry in vain.

202
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Tonight,

203
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,880
you can sleep on the sofa.

204
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Stay cold.

205
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Let me tell you.

206
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,400
I'm not forgiving you.

207
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm just afraid
you'll freeze to death.

208
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,000
He met his ex behind my back.

209
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
He's at fault.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
Why did I freaking eagerly
wake up so early...

211
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,360
to make him hangover soup?

212
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Hello?

213
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Mr. Chi.

214
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,919
Move your stuff...

215
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,080
our of the house.

216
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm renting it out.

217
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Okay.

218
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
I'll stop by later.

219
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Thank you.

220
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Wei Wei.

221
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
It's a bit sweet.

222
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Later,

223
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
I'm going to the suburbs.

224
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Didn't I leave my stuff
with the landlord?

225
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Do you want to go together?

226
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm not going.

227
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Later,

228
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,160
I'm having a meal with Xiao Shuai.

229
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,680
Haven't I moved all my snakes?

230
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,520
What are you doing here
at this hour?

231
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,240
In the months since you moved out,

232
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I've been hanging out here.

233
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,320
You just didn't know.

234
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,280
Get the heck out of here!

235
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,920
No.

236
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,440
Don't freaking play games with me.

237
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,720
Go back where you freaking should,
I'm telling you.

238
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Look at yourself.

239
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,440
It's like you're worried
I'd catch a cold.

240
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
Stop being freaking dramatic, okay?

241
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
When you moved,

242
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
you left a snake egg.

243
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
This is it.

244
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Isn't it cute?

245
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,440
Why are you always here?

246
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Where's Chi Cheng?

247
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,520
He went back to the house
in the suburbs to move his stuff.

248
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,800
Why didn't you go with him?

249
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I didn't feel like it.

250
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,240
Did you visit Wang Shuo
at the hospital?

251
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
What do you think of him?

252
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,000
Isn't he very ordinary?

253
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
He's not ordinary.

254
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,400
He's fair and neat.

255
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
He's quite handsome too.

256
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,680
No matter how handsome he is,
he can't compare to you.

257
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
He can.

258
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
I saw Chi Cheng yesterday
at the hospital.

259
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
Chi Cheng didn't come home
all day.

260
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,440
I called him,

261
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,040
but he lied and said...

262
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,040
he was with a client.

263
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Do you think...

264
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
there's a misunderstanding?

265
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
What misunderstanding
can there be?

266
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,560
I fished information out
of Xiao Gang.

267
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,120
He said he didn't see
Chi Cheng all day.

268
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,240
Chi Cheng must've been
in the hospital.

269
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
He must've seen him too.

270
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,920
But he didn't dare to say it.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Otherwise,

272
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,480
he wouldn't have apologized
to me as soon as he came home.

273
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,640
That's not Chi Cheng's style.

274
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,360
If he really cares
about Wang Shuo...

275
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,720
and wants to see him,

276
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,920
he can do it openly.

277
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,600
If he's really
feeling guilty about it,

278
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,240
he wouldn't let you know.

279
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,320
That makes sense.

280
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,200
You didn't ask him?

281
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Why ask him?

282
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I pretended not to know.

283
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
This is how...

284
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,000
a lot of misunderstandings start.

285
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,200
When they accumulate
and don't get resolved,

286
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,480
the trust that should
be there will be lost.

287
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
If you're really worried,

288
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
you can do...

289
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,040
a surprise check.

290
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Isn't he...

291
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,960
packing his things right now?

292
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,520
And you're not around.

293
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,040
If something is going on
between them,

294
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,479
maybe...

295
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
at this hour,

296
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
they're having an affair.

297
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
Should I...Should I really go?

298
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,040
If I really catch them...

299
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,960
Then break up.

300
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Don't look like...

301
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,320
you can't live without him.

302
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Okay.

303
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,160
I'll go. It's best
to catch them in bed.

304
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Then..

305
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
we'll have a single's party
right away.

306
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Wang Shuo.

307
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,480
I'll ask you one last time.

308
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,599
You came back six months ago.

309
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Why didn't you show up?

310
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,880
I show up here all the time.

311
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Don't I?

312
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,880
It's just that you don't come.

313
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
I've already moved my snakes.
Why should I come back?

314
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
Your heart has already moved.

315
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,800
How would you find me?

316
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Go home now.

317
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I heard...

318
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
that for Wu Suo Wei's sake,

319
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
you killed Yellow Dragon.

320
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Who told you that?

321
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
People are talking about it.

322
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,880
I heard it myself.

323
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,519
You're freaking inhuman!

324
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
You killed Yellow Dragon!

325
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Wang Shuo!

326
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,080
Since you started
doing those things,

327
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,160
all these snakes deserve to die.

328
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Are you crazy?

329
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
This snake is poisonous.

330
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
You didn't know, did you?

331
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
Actually, humans are poisonous too.

332
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,880
Your mouth is still so sweet.

333
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
It's okay.

334
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm fine.

335
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,840
You're freaking crazy.

336
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Chi Cheng!

337
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,680
You only asked me
why I was gone for so many years.

338
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,239
You never asked me...

339
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,319
why I did those things...

340
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,480
with Guo Cheng Yu!

341
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Hello?

342
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
Are you Zhang Li Ya's son?

343
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Yes, I am.

344
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,680
Come to the hospital now.

345
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,440
Okay. I'll be right there.

346
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Chi Cheng.

347
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
You're good.

348
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Not bad.

349
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,640
I didn't waste this gas money
for nothing.

350
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
It's not too late.

351
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,280
It's not too late at all.

352
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,440
I haven't fallen in too deep yet.

353
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm still sober.

354
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,200
Who can resist the reconciliation
of the one you love but can't have?

355
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
I knew you were unreliable.

356
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,720
It's not like
I'm too emotionally invested.

357
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Chi Cheng.

358
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,520
I won't let you easily
get away with this.

359
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Who is it?

360
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Darn it.

361
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Why is he here?

362
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
I don't have a place
to stay anymore.

363
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm here to stay overnight.

364
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,840
How did you know I live here?

365
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
With Cheng Yu around,

366
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,520
how can I not know where you live?

367
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,240
Cheng Yu and Chi Cheng
aren't here today.

368
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
We're not even close.

369
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,880
Why did you come to my house?

370
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,800
I like you.

371
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,760
I like Daniel Wu.

372
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,320
I didn't go to his house.

373
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
It smells so good.

374
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,720
No wonder Cheng Yu likes you.

375
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Get up.

376
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,040
Get up!

377
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,959
Please.

378
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,600
Let me stay at your house
for one night.

379
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,400
I'm begging you.

380
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,279
Have pity on me.

381
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,040
Let me sleep over.

382
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,960
If Wang Shuo is here,

383
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,040
Da Wei should be with Chi Cheng.

384
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Forget it.

385
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
I'll let him stay,

386
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,359
so he won't cause trouble
for Wu Suo Wei.

387
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
Let me stay.

388
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,320
- Mrs. Wu, you're awake.
- Xiao Chi.

389
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,120
You didn't tell Da Qiong, did you?

390
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
Don't worry.

391
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,520
Are you out of your mind?

392
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,920
What's wrong?
Why did you turn off my speaker?

393
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,920
You're disturbing people
early in the morning.

394
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,399
There are so many hotels
and guesthouses out there.

395
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Why didn't you stay there?

396
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,840
Why stay here
to save a few hundred dollars?

397
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,440
I hate it
when people touch my things.

398
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,440
Your food is so delicious.

399
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Why can't you let me...

400
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
have a bite?

401
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Chi Cheng had
such good taste back then.

402
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,320
Why don't you say Cheng Yu...

403
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
had good taste too?

404
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,600
Because who Cheng Yu likes...

405
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
isn't you.

406
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,920
That's why I came to stay
at your place for the night.

407
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
Out of all the people,

408
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
you're the smartest.

409
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
Xiao Shuai.

410
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Why are you here?

411
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Good morning.

412
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,359
I didn't freaking give you...

413
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Jiang Xiao Shuai's address...

414
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,200
for this.

415
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,000
But that's why I'm here.

416
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I'll get going.

417
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Bye, baby.

418
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Get lost.

419
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Why is he here?

420
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Are you mad...

421
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
that he slept here with me...

422
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
or that I slept here with him?

423
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
What do you think?

424
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,880
It was so late last night.

425
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,320
I couldn't stop him
from staying here.

426
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,640
Don't hang out with him anymore.

427
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,199
Let me tell you.
With people like him,

428
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,920
who knows what he wants to do?

429
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,159
Before this,
he asked me for your address.

430
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
And he said...

431
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,720
He said the first time he saw you,

432
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,160
he really liked you.

433
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,160
He wanted to send you some food.

434
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
But he sent...

435
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
And...

436
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,760
you even let him sleep over.

437
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
I...

438
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
I haven't even slept over
at your place yet.

439
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Xiao Shuai.

440
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Later on,

441
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,720
I'm going on a business trip
for a few days.

442
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
But I swear.

443
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,840
It's really for work.

444
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Okay.

445
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,280
By the way, listen to me.

446
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
If Wang Shuo comes again,

447
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
don't open the door for him,

448
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,480
let alone let him stay the night.

449
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Do you hear me?

450
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Okay.

451
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Where's Wu Suo Wei?

452
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,160
Why are you looking
for your guy here?

453
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,120
Wasn't he with you yesterday?

454
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,120
He left around 9pm yesterday.

455
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Where did he go after that?

456
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Afterwards...

457
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,000
After that, he went to you.

458
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
He went to me?

459
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm at the office.

460
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Wei Wei.

461
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Where did you go yesterday?

462
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
I went home...

463
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
to be with my mom.

464
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
That's impossible.

465
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Why is it impossible?

466
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Wei Wei.

467
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Yesterday,

468
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
did you go...

469
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,360
- to the place I ren...
- Come to the office.

470
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,720
Can't we just talk things out?

471
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,600
Did you see something?

472
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,560
What should I have seen?

473
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Wei Wei.

474
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Listen to me, okay?

475
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Tell me.

476
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,720
Why didn't you go home last night?

477
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,320
Last night,
I didn't go home because...

478
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I...

479
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
went to meet a client.

480
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I'm sorry.

481
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
You're sorry.

482
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
You're sorry again.

483
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,759
Before this, asking you
to say those words...

484
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,160
would have almost killed you.

485
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Now,

486
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,440
you said them twice in three days.

487
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Wei Wei.

488
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,400
I'll explain it to you...

489
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
It's not a big deal.

490
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
You're meeting with a client.

491
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,560
I should be happy.

492
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,280
Can't you listen to me
for once, Mrs. Wu?

493
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,920
Why were you in such a hurry
to get discharged?

494
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,280
There's no point
in staying in the hospital.

495
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,120
If Da Qiong finds out,

496
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
he'll get suspicious.

497
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,040
Thank you for everything
during this time.

498
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Mr. Wu.

499
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:38,880
A client wants to see you.

500
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Who?

501
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Mr. Wang Shuo.

502
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,520
- Wang Shuo?
- Yes.

503
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Let him in.

504
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Okay.

505
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Hello.

506
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm Wang Shuo.

507
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,440
(Bonus Clip)

508
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,279
I'm not playing anymore.

509
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,359
Play one more round.

510
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,640
What should the two of us play then?

511
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
I'll go easy on you
in the next round.

512
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,400
I can't beat you. Seriously.

513
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,760
Find someone else to play with.

514
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,480
I'm not playing anymore. I quit.
