(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,880
(Episode 7,
Anyone Can Be Mad at Me But You)

3
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Actually,

4
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,480
you really didn't have
to drive me home.

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I thought...

6
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
I'd come up and see if it's nice.

7
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,720
What's there to see?

8
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
It's nice.

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Young Master Chi.

10
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,561
What haven't you seen before?

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
There's a lot.

12
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
(Yue Yue)

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Go ahead.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Hubby, I miss you so much.

15
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,920
Can you come and keep me company?

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Go.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Don't make her wait.

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,360
Can you really bear for me to go?

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Goodness.

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Don't forget.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,080
Your dad still has your snakes.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Who told you that?

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Xiao Gang.

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
What a tattletale.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
You should go.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm going to take a shower.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
That's good.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Let's take a shower together.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
If you have time to waste on me,

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,640
your dad doesn't have time
to waste on you.

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,240
- Go.
- I won't.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Go.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Go.

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
You swing around so much...

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,000
that it confuses me.

36
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,840
(Medical Area
Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out)

37
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
(Smoking is hazardous to health)

38
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,361
(Please don't smoke
in prohibited areas)

39
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,960
This cigarette is good.

40
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
This way, please.

41
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Mom.

42
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Jia Li.

43
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Yue Yue, you're here.

44
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,816
- Come here.
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

45
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
Mrs. Chi, this is for you.

46
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,320
Isn't this the shawl
I like a few days ago?

47
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Look at you.

48
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,000
Didn't I tell you I don't want it?

49
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,679
Please accept it, Mrs. Chi.

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,840
This is a token from me.

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,999
I just got my salary yesterday.
It's not much,

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
but it's enough to buy a shawl.

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
You silly girl.

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,279
If you spent all your salary
on a shawl,

55
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,440
what would you eat and drink?

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
I don't spend that much alone.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
I don't need to spend money much.

58
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Mom.

59
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Let's eat first.

60
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Let's eat.

61
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,800
- Here.
- Have a seat.

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't be shy, Yue Yue.

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,920
I didn't expect Chi Cheng's sister
to be so difficult to please.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,680
(Stop dreaming, the Chis won't let
someone like you marry their son)

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Who sent this?

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
(Look at yourself,
you can't pretend forever)

67
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:06,361
(You really think Chi Cheng's
mom likes you? Dream on!)

68
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,920
Do they think they can scare me
with a few lousy messages?

69
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,760
Then I've wasted my experience
all these years.

70
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
We'll see.

71
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,016
Even if you want Chi Cheng
to focus on more serious things,

72
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,080
you can't just find a random woman.

73
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
Look at how your brother is.

74
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,559
He's lucky to have a girlfriend.

75
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Yue Yue...

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
may not come from a rich family,

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
but she's quite honest.

78
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
She looks nice too.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880
She's honest?

80
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,960
Can't you tell what she's like?

81
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Don't talk nonsense.

82
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
You've only met her once.

83
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
What can you tell?

84
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,880
Miss, do you need anything?

85
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,560
If you want to listen,
come in and listen openly.

86
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,920
Mrs. Chi, Chi Cheng left?

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
He said something came up.

88
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,839
Ignore him. Let's continue eating.

89
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Here, have a seat.

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Why is it you?

91
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Are you disappointed...

92
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,400
that I'm not Chi Cheng?

93
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,600
Or are you disappointed...

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,160
that I'm not Yue Yue?

95
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
You already know?

96
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Chi Cheng...

97
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
doesn't know this as of now.

98
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,120
But in the future,

99
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,840
that's hard to say.

100
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
What exactly do you want?

101
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,040
I like Jiang Xiao Shuai.

102
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,320
I want you to secretly matchmake us.

103
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,480
That's impossible.

104
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,959
You're such a playboy.

105
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,880
How can I let my teacher
jump into a trap?

106
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,040
How is Jiang Xiao Shuai
your teacher?

107
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I...

108
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
So he's the one...

109
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
who's been helping you strategize
behind the scenes.

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,440
Aren't you guys afraid...

111
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,200
that I'll tell Chi Cheng
about this...

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,160
and ruin your plans?

113
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
You won't tell him.

114
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Why not?

115
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
If you tell Chi Cheng...

116
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,240
and ruin our relationship,

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
Chi Cheng will continue
to steal the person you like.

118
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,440
If you really like Jiang Xiao Shuai,

119
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,040
you wouldn't take this risk.

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,776
I've been sitting here all day.

121
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,880
My back is aching.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Xiao Shuai.

123
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Xiao Shuai.

124
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Why are you here?

125
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Let's go.

126
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
I'll take you to get a massage.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Forget it.

128
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,320
I still have a lot of work to do.

129
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,039
I know a masseur nearby.

130
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,080
He's very professional.

131
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,400
He's much more professional
than you, Sir?

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,839
Sir?

133
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Go.

134
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Sir?

135
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Who's the teacher?

136
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
That's enough.

137
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Stop talking in riddles.

138
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I know everything.

139
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Tell me.

140
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,600
If Chi Cheng finds out...

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,240
that you're the one strategizing
behind the scenes,

142
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,680
who among you
do you think will suffer more?

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
What's going on?

144
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,840
Don't threaten my teacher.

145
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,760
Xiao Shuai, listen to me.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,816
This must be made clear
sooner or later anyway.

147
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
At worst,
I just won't take my revenge.

148
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
What about Chi Cheng?

149
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
Will he spare you?

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Da Wei.

151
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
I really need to find someone...

152
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
for a massage.

153
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
Come on. Let's go get a massage.

154
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
It's okay. Don't worry.

155
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,560
Sir, you're good at massaging.

156
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Where did you learn it?

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you want to learn it?

158
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
It's very easy. I'll teach you.

159
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Okay.

160
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
First, find the trapezius muscle.

161
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,400
- The trapezius muscle.
- Rub it from the top down.

162
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Mr. Guo.

163
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,200
Why don't you let him practice?

164
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Can I...

165
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
do that?

166
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,440
Can I say no?

167
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Come on.

168
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Let's do it.

169
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Slowly.

170
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Sit down.

171
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,080
Find the trapezius muscle first.

172
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
The trapezius muscle.

173
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,240
That's right. A little lower.

174
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Right here.

175
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
Come on. Rub it hard.

176
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,679
Then go down...

177
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,800
to the shoulder.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,760
To the shoulder.

179
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I remember this order.

180
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,239
Go on.

181
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
We'll leave first.

182
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Let's go.

183
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Does it feel good?

184
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Yes.

185
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Dr. Jiang, you're...

186
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
a miracle worker indeed.

187
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,680
Go. I won't serve you anymore.

188
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,680
You're the one who should go.

189
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,040
This is my bed.

190
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Your bed is over there.

191
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
What's wrong with me?

192
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,039
Just pay the price
I told you earlier...

193
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
to buy his snake eggs.

194
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
If you lose money,

195
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I'll make it up to you.

196
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,720
Yes, Young Master Chi.

197
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
The snake eggs you recommended...

198
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
are definitely worth the price.

199
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,400
Take care, Young Master Chi.

200
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Goodbye, Master Chi.

201
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,560
I can't believe he found
a place of operation.

202
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,080
This business...

203
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,320
just breaks even.

204
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
It's a waste of effort.

205
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,599
Look at you,

206
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
what are you guys eating?

207
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,200
Yue Yue, if you
didn't bring me here,

208
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,480
I wouldn't have come here.

209
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,320
It's hot, stuffy, and humid.

210
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,320
I think it's fine here.

211
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,879
My place is next to the highway.

212
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,720
It's so noisy every night
that I can't sleep.

213
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,040
It's much quieter here.

214
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
How can you sleep
with all the noise?

215
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
How about this?

216
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,400
Why don't you move here?

217
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,120
That way, the two of you...

218
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
can take care of each other.

219
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
No.

220
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
I'm used to living alone.

221
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
Can you live alone forever?

222
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,840
You have to get married
and have kids.

223
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm full.

224
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,440
Don't mind him. Listen to me.

225
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,839
Stay here tonight.

226
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,920
Don't go back and forth.

227
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Mrs. Chi.

228
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,919
This is so embarrassing.

229
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,360
What's there
to be embarrassed about?

230
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
I consider you my daughter-in-law.

231
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,840
Don't worry, Mrs. Chi.

232
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll take good care
of Chi Cheng for you.

233
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
You're such a nice girl.

234
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,520
(Five minutes ago)

235
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
What are you looking at?

236
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Darn it.

237
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
I forgot to let
Green-Eyed Monster out.

238
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Come on.

239
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,160
Let's get some fresh air.

240
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,720
(Watch your son. Don't let him
bother me again. I'm straight!)

241
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Mrs. Chi.

242
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Are you guys sleeping?

243
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,680
We're about to go to bed.

244
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,960
How is he treating you tonight?

245
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,280
Did you argue?

246
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
No.

247
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,000
Chi Cheng and I are good.

248
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
What's wrong?

249
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Nothing.

250
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm glad you didn't argue.

251
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,960
After some time, Chi Cheng will be
going on a business trip.

252
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,600
You should go with him.

253
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,440
Make the most of it.

254
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,480
His dad and I are waiting
to have grandchildren.

255
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,960
Mrs. Chi.

256
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,680
Chi Cheng and I...

257
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
are not married yet.

258
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,720
You can get married
when you come back.

259
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,759
As long as you two get along,

260
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,840
nothing else matters.

261
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Okay, Mrs. Chi.

262
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
I got it.

263
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
Chi Cheng and I will do our best.

264
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,880
Get some rest
when you're not busy anymore.

265
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Bye, Mrs. Chi.

266
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,800
Take the medicine three times a day.

267
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
One pill each time.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
- Thank you, Dr. Xiao Shuai.
- You're welcome.

269
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,920
I got 500,000 yuan.

270
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,840
It's good to have a rich heir
as a boyfriend.

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,280
Money comes so easily.

272
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,199
This money has nothing
to do with him.

273
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
It's the result of my own hard work.

274
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
You're right.

275
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,656
You're helping him kill an evil
woman and look for a snake den.

276
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,520
It's only right
that he gives you this benefit.

277
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
But I think...

278
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,720
you should give him something too.

279
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,320
After all, he helped you so much.

280
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,920
Last quarter's feeds cost
was 69,000 yuan.

281
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,039
My junior's management cost
was 100,000 yuan.

282
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,560
That's 170,000 yuan in total.

283
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,240
And the snake farm's electric
bill, rent, and water bill.

284
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,880
Right. Last month,
I borrowed 10,000 yuan from my mom.

285
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,880
If I sum them all up
and subtract these,

286
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,376
there's only over 30,000 yuan left.

287
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Over 30,000 yuan?

288
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,561
How about buying him a watch?

289
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,919
I'm unemployed now.

290
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,840
I need to have some living expenses.

291
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,480
Apart from living expenses,
how much do you have left?

292
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Over 5,000 yuan.

293
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,496
How about buying him some clothes?

294
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
No.

295
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,680
It's my mom's birthday next month.

296
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,319
I have to give her 2,000 yuan.

297
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,616
There's still over 3,000 yuan left.

298
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,960
How about buying him some razors?

299
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's not right.

300
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,519
I was too busy last week.

301
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,680
I hired three part-timers
whom I haven't paid them yet.

302
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,160
Minus their salaries,

303
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,800
there's only 36 yuan left.

304
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
How about blowing
50 sugar figures for him?

305
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
No.

306
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,560
That's still a bit tiring.

307
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,640
Hey.

308
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,560
The box of cigarettes
he gave you yesterday...

309
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
contains 50 cartons.

310
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,440
That's 30,000 yuan.

311
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
That's right.

312
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,760
I didn't think of that
until you mentioned cigarettes.

313
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,079
Why don't I sell
a pack of cigarettes...

314
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,720
and buy him an ashtray?

315
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,240
An ashtray?

316
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,160
I'll freaking beat you to death
with an ashtray!

317
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Bring me the ledger.

318
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,280
Bring it over and let me see it.

319
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,000
What's the 100,000 yuan for?

320
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,560
I can't spend this 100,000 yuan.

321
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,240
That's my personal savings.

322
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,760
The sound of these footsteps...

323
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Chi Cheng.

324
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Darn it.

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,719
"Elizabeth is sitting
with her mother and sisters,"

326
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,839
"contemplating what she just heard."

327
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,720
"She isn't sure
if she could tell everyone."

328
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,680
"At this moment,"

329
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,680
"Sir William Lucas arrived."

330
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
What are you doing here?

331
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
You knew I was coming.

332
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Why are you dressed so seductively?

333
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
Watch your mouth.

334
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,920
This is a civilized place.

335
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
A civilized place?

336
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Then may I ask...

337
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,280
how it bred
such a seductive person like you?

338
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,840
Who are you calling seductive?

339
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Don't you know...

340
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,880
who I'm calling seductive?

341
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
It's been days.

342
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
I've freaking missed you so much.

343
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
What are you doing?

344
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
Let go! I bought you a present.

345
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Like heck you did.

346
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,440
I really did!

347
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Fine.

348
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,280
I really bought one for you.

349
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,120
You're brushing me off
with this piece of crap?

350
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,000
You don't want it?
I don't even want to give it to you.

351
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I want it.

352
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,960
Why did you hit me?

353
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm checking if it's good.

354
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
You're a pervert.

355
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
It works quite well.

356
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Is it real?

357
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
It's fake.

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Class A.

359
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
That's good.

360
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,600
I've never used a fake one.

361
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Put it on for me.

362
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,080
Don't you have hands?

363
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
My hands...

364
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,760
aren't as good as yours.

365
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Put it on for me.

366
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Fine.

367
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Turn around.

368
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
I don't know how.

369
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Fine.

370
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
I'm not leaving today.

371
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Why?

372
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,360
You've trapped me.

373
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
How can I leave?

374
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Let go.

375
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,559
Hey, this belt is quite sturdy.

376
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Darn you.

377
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:07,920
Is this how you use the belt?

378
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,120
Don't freaking touch me.

379
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
What did you say?

380
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,640
Stop squeezing me.

381
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,880
Since you won't let me sleep
with you, let me sleep comfortably.

382
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
No.

383
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Da Bao.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,520
I might go
on a business trip tomorrow.

385
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,920
I'll be gone for four to five days.

386
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,680
Go then.

387
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
If you go,
I can rest for a few days...

388
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,840
and do some serious work.

389
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,440
I'm going with my girlfriend.

390
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's good.

391
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
Think of it as a vacation.

392
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
What's wrong?

393
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Are you mad?

394
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm great.

395
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,560
Then turn around and look at me.

396
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
What's there to look at?

397
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Chi Cheng.

398
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Save it.

399
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,600
Don't you love this?

400
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
You...

401
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Da Bao.

402
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,080
Anyone can be mad at me,

403
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
but you.

404
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Why?

405
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,240
Because only when you're mad...

406
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
will I feel anxious.

407
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Also,

408
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,040
I'll do...

409
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
as I promised.

410
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,120
Hey. What's going on?

411
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,880
Chi Cheng is going
on a business trip.

412
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,720
Yue Yue is going with him.

413
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
Are you jealous?

414
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,080
Why would I be jealous?

415
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Let me tell you.

416
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:06,080
Things are going the way
I want them to.

417
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I guess...

418
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:09,240
Chi Cheng's mom...

419
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,600
deliberately planned
this business trip.

420
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,720
She got my text
and couldn't take it anymore.

421
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,040
She wants Yue Yue to be
her daughter-in-law right away.

422
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,520
She thinks she can turn Chi Cheng
straight this way.

423
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
Your tactic is quite effective.

424
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,440
You're provoking Yue Yue
on one hand.

425
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,520
On the other, you're provoking
Chi Cheng's mom.

426
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,559
It's a two-pronged attack.

427
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,120
Yes. The later they come back,
the better.

428
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,399
The later they come back,
the more Yue Yue...

429
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
will hate Green-Eyed Monster.

430
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,359
Yue Yue already thinks...

431
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,400
that she's the daughter-in-law
of the Chi family.

432
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
With her personality,
once she benefits from it,

433
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,600
she'll get carried away.

434
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,359
When she comes back,

435
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,400
she'll surely try to get rid
of Green-Eyed Monster.

436
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
So...

437
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,720
you want Yue Yue and Chi Cheng
to spend more time together,

438
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
right?

439
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Of course.

440
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,960
I'm going to check out the market.

441
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
Now, the snakes
are going to be sold.

442
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I'm going to welcome
the second chapter of my life.

443
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
I'll get going.

444
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,200
Chi Cheng, you jerk!

445
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
Gang Zi.

446
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,280
Have you booked the hotel?

447
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
I got a business suite.
Yue Yue already arrived.

448
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,319
If you don't want
to share a bed with her,

449
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
you can sleep on the sofa.

450
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,880
You know me best.

451
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
By the way,

452
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
you told Wu Suo Wei...

453
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
about the snakes?

454
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
He asked me himself.

455
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
I just responded a bit.

456
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,160
I didn't tell him
about the progress.

457
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
All right.

458
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,960
If he asks about the snakes again,

459
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
don't tell him.

460
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
I don't want him to worry.

461
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,576
There's nothing going on tonight.

462
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,840
- Go get some rest.
- All right.

463
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Surprise!

464
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,560
I didn't see anything.

465
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Here's your suitcase.

466
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,120
Has he left?

467
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Yes.

468
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Your mom said...

469
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,760
our parents should meet
in a couple of days...

470
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,640
to plan our wedding.

471
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,560
Tonight, should we...

472
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
What?

473
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,280
I thought he didn't come with you.

474
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
We came by car.

475
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
What's wrong?

476
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,360
I... I'm going to shower first.

477
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
What's wrong?

478
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,720
I had a nightmare.

479
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,880
I dreamed that you abandoned me.

480
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Don't worry.

481
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,600
I won't abandon you.

482
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
You're the best.

483
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Go to sleep.

484
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,960
One day,

485
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,520
I'm going to kill you, you beast.

486
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,520
Come, this way. I'll show you.

487
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,480
Sir, where's the snake section?

488
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
This way. Come on.

489
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,960
Up here. Take a look.

490
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Sir.

491
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
This snake is no good either.

492
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,640
I can tell you're an expert.

493
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,000
Come here.

494
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Let me show you this.

495
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Look at this.

496
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,040
All the snakes here are valuable.

497
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
Where did you get these snakes?

498
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,800
Don't ask about that.

499
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,920
I won't trick you.

500
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,240
I don't dare to buy it then.

501
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,679
What if it's wild?

502
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,200
I won't be able to keep them alive.

503
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
It's a waste of money.

504
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,760
Don't worry.

505
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,320
I guarantee that they're all farmed.

506
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Farmed?

507
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,199
Who's so capable...

508
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,840
of farming so many valuable snakes?

509
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,680
They must be smuggled.

510
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Young man.

511
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,880
Are you really going to buy them?

512
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,840
I was going to.

513
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,399
But since you keep babbling,

514
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,959
I'm not confident about it.

515
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Forget it.

516
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Wait a minute.

517
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Come back.

518
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,120
You're forcing me to tell the truth.

519
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,680
What do you mean?

520
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,839
If you're buying something...

521
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
that's not legitimate,

522
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
would you dare to buy it?

523
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,000
Come on. I'll tell you.

524
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
Do you have any leads on the snakes?

525
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
Yes.

526
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,360
Then you can
just tell Chi Cheng about it.

527
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,280
Let him deal with it himself.

528
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Anyway,

529
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,960
he's also just using Yue Yue
to convince his dad.

530
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,920
If he finds them himself,

531
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,440
Yue Yue will be of no use to him.

532
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
No.

533
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Why not?

534
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Think about it.

535
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,920
If I tell Chi Cheng the truth,

536
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,359
Chi Cheng will do
whatever it takes...

537
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,640
to get those snakes back.

538
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
When that happens,

539
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:44,559
Chi Cheng's conflict
with his dad will escalate.

540
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Chi Cheng and his dad...

541
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
His snakes...

542
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,920
will inevitably be taken again.

543
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,680
- They'll be taken again...
- I think...

544
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,440
I should help him in secret.

545
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
That way,

546
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,720
we can get the snakes...

547
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,040
- and push the blame to his dad...
- Get the snakes...

548
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,520
to get rid of future troubles.

549
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Wu Suo Wei.

550
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,240
Do you want them to break up...

551
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
or do you want to be with him?

552
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
That's nonsense.

553
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,360
Of course I want them to break up.

554
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,680
Then why are you so worried
about the snakes?

555
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,160
You're here for revenge,

556
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,880
not to help him save the snakes.

557
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Well...

558
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,280
I'm just doing a good deed
to accumulate merit.

559
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Think about it.

560
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:33,280
I've sabotaged Chi Cheng
so many times before.

561
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,520
Now, I finally have a chance
to make it up to him.

562
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
I'm making it up to him.

563
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,000
Are you still going to proceed
with the plan about Yue Yue?

564
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Yes.

565
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Why not?

566
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Think about it.

567
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,120
- When she and Chi Cheng break up,
- Chi Cheng.

568
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,279
- Yue Yue will definitely...
- Chi Cheng.

569
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,720
Cry to Chi Cheng's mom.

570
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,079
- Chi Cheng's mom will surely...
- Chi Cheng's mom.

571
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,960
- Vent her anger on Chi Cheng.
- Chi Cheng.

572
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,040
Chi Cheng will definitely
hate Yue Yue too...

573
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,440
and cut her off.

574
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,160
I seriously suspect...

575
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,040
that your love rival has changed.

576
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,640
Goodness, the weather is so hot.

577
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,840
All right.

578
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,840
Let's talk about practical things.

579
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
How do you plan...

580
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,200
to get the snakes...

581
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,080
out of the Group?

582
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Like this.

583
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,080
(Bonus Clip)

584
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,480
Isn't this the brand Chi Cheng
often wears?

585
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,080
I'll just go in and take a look.

586
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,640
I definitely won't buy anything.

587
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,639
In the future,

588
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
I'll earn this back from Chi Cheng.
