Hello.

18
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
<i>Chi Cheng, I recently got a new snake.
Do you dare to come?</i>

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,519
Just wait for me.

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,200
Huang Long, it's your turn.

21
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,199
Mom, I'll do it.

22
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,319
It's fine, let me do it. Today,
my future daughter-in-law is coming.

23
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
Thank you, mom.

24
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,040
Look, I bought three jins of crayfish for Yue Yue.

25
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,680
Mom, this doesn't even weigh three jins at all.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,919
What?

27
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,399
Ms. Liu knew my future daughter-in-law is coming,
so she even gave me ten extra crayfish.

28
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,360
Mom, she fooled you.
It definitely isn't three jins.

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Half bag is just water, I'm going to find her.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,639
Son, don't go.

31
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,199
It's difficult for Ms. Liu to run a business.

32
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,199
Don't cause her trouble.

33
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,120
- Mom.
- I've told you that suffering is a blessing.

34
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,919
The more sufferings, the more blessings.

35
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,840
Yes, Mom. We've been like this
for all these years.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,439
But today isn't different.
Yue Yue is coming today.

37
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,120
Right, why isn't she here yet?

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,920
It's okay.

39
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,280
She's always late when we date.
She's probably nearby now.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,999
It's hard to find our place,
I'll go to pick her up.

41

Yue Yue, you're here.

44
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,480
We can go eat now.
My mom has already prepared the meal.

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,759
My mom is really happy knowing that you're coming.

46
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,199
I'm not here for the meal.
I have something to tell you.

47
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,480
Yue Yue, go ahead.

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Wu Qi Qiong, let's break up.

49
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,000
Why, Yue Yue? Why do you say that?

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
Didn't you promise to come to my house
for the meal? Why so sudden?

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
What? I used to be attracted by you
because you were handsome.

52
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,920
But look at you now,
being with you makes me feel ashamed.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,720
Yue Yue, what do you like?
I can change myself for you.

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,519
I can change back, Yue Yue.

55
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,600
We've been together for so long.
And we're about to get married.

56
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,079
Wang Zhen Long, what did you do?

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Look at him, such a loser.

58
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Why waste words to him?

59
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Go for it!

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
Go for it, Mr. Guo!

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
Go for it!

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Go for it!

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,160
Today, you're destined to lose.

Weren't they the best buddies?
Aren't they tired after many years of competing?

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,680
Do you think Mr. Chi's snake will win,
or Mr. Guo's?

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Of course Mr. Chi's. He always wins.

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,879
I heard that Mr. Guo bought the black snake
from South America at great expense.

68
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,000
Today, Mr. Guo must make a comeback.

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go for it!

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040

- Get it!
- Get it!

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Sorry to disturb you.

359
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,559
You like men?

360
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,879
What? Scared?

361
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,040
No, nothing.

362
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,639
I'm leaving.

363
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,559
When did you take it?

364
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,519
When you were just talking.

365
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,640
My second startup is about to begin. Wish me luck.

366
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,440
Where are you going?

367
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,839
<i>Chi, you are absent
in the class reunion again this year.</i>

368
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,720
I am too busy to come.

369
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
<i>What? Stop it.</i>

370
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
<i>You, Guo Cheng Yu,</i>

371
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,480
<i>and Wang Shuo who loves raising snakes
were really close before.</i>

372
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,280
<i>Now…</i>

373
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

374
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,440
<i>After the two successful cases,
we're now looking for the third one.</i>

375
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,440
Found it! Let me show you.

376
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,440
<i>Isn't it good?</i>

377
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
<i>Alright, let's test him.</i>

378
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
We've already connected the pinhole camera.

379
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,759
I'll record the whole process.

380
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,800
Once I turn off the phone, a miracle happens.

381
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,760
Are you alright?

382
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,119
Thank you.

383
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,240
You faked a fall?

384
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,720
You pretended to help me, but I can't fake a fall?

385
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,119
Bro, I'm not a thief.

386
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,680
I'm just recording a video. Here's your phone.

387
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,200
Bro, look, now you believe me, right?

388
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm really not a thief.

389
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,799
What do you want?

390
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,760
I'm really not a thief, really.

391
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,559
You brought yourself here.

392
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:13,200
Wait, have we met before?

393
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,040
Bro, I have evidence to prove
I'm not a thief, let me show you.

394
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,119
Look, I run an anti-pickpocket account.

395
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,480
You're just a random passerby I picked.

396
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,920
This is to educate people
about some common thief tactics,

397
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
to avoid being stolen.

398
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,279
Trust me, bro. The livestream viewers
can vouch for me.

399
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,920
Look.

400
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,919
Look, right?

401
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,359
Right?

402
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,960
What's your name?

403
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Wu Suo Wei.

404
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,279
What? That arrogant?

405
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,039
No.

406
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,160
It's my real name.

407
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,240
I have evidence. Wait for me.

408
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,040
ID card.

409
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Look.

410
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,584
[Wu Suo Wei]

411
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,799
You are indeed named Wu Suo Wei.

412
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,960
Right. It's all a misunderstanding.

413
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,639
- Quite unique.
- Not at all.

414
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,599
Oh my.

415
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,319
Why did you throw sugar at me that day?

416
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,480
Bro, I didn't mean to.

417
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,880
I wanted to splash the one next to…

418
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,240
I didn't intend to splash you.

419
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,759
Bro, I was wrong.

420
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,559
Sorry.

421
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,800
Bro.

422
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,680
Bro, don't go.

423
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,839
Don't.

424
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,680
Two options for you.

425
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,839
Either get beaten up by me,

426
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,200
or have your device confiscated.

427
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,480
I choose to be beaten.

428
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,280
It's already settled.

429
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,519
Bro, give it back to me.

430
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,400
I spent a lot of money on it, bro.
Give it back to me, please.

431
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Bro!

432
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,079
Mr. Chi.

433
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,559
Mr. Chi, I brought you the person.
He tried to escape abroad.

434
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,200
Mr. Chi, listen to me.

435
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,720
Your dad brought dozens of people to me,
and I was scared to death.

436
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,759
It was your dad who questioned me,
otherwise I wouldn't have told him anything.

437
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,680
Don't lie.

438
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,480
The call to the chairman's office
was made by Guo Cheng Yu's men, right?

439
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,919
When the chairman drove to you,
you were long gone.

440
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,119
Come here.

441
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,440
Mr. Chi.

442
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,359
What do you guys think of him?

443
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,680
Not bad, we all quite like him.

444
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,839
Everyone really likes you.

445
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,599
Wait, wait.

446
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll leave him to you guys. I'm leaving.

447
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,759
Mr. Chi, Mr. Chi.

448
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,440
- Good boy.
- Mr. Chi.

449
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Get lost.

450
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,920
Mr. Chi, I'm sorry.

451
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,680
Mr. Chi, I was wrong.

452
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,440
Let go of me.

453
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
- Watch out.
- Mr. Chi.

454
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,680
Don't let him die.

455
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,039
I was wrong, let me go.

456
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,319
Let go. Mr. Chi.

457
00:32:56,134 --> 00:33:03,391
[Splendid Minghao]

458
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,400
Whose car is blocking my way?

459
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,519
Darn!

460
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,599
How did he park?

461
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,399
Mr. Chi.

462
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,200
Is it your car?

463
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,599
Drive away or it will be smashed.

464
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,559
What are you waiting for? Get lost.

465
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,559
<i>This is the kind of man who deserves me.</i>

466
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,440
Don't touch me. Focus on driving.

467
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,240
What's wrong with you?

468
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Nothing.

469
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,519
Darn, he blinded me.

470
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,199
Slow down.

471
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,479
Give way, give way.

472
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,119
Wang Zhen Long, wake up.

473
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,280
Wang Zhen Long, speak up.

474
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,639
Why did you call me back?

475
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,489
You're always like someone owes you money.

476
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:07,920
I'll give you one year,

477
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,480
if you can't find a girlfriend,
I'll decide whom you'll marry.

478
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,360
Okay, as long as she's not afraid of snakes.

479
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,079
Do you really have to carry that with you?

480
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,840
Our son doesn't have a girlfriend.

481
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,000
No matter what you say, he won't listen.

482
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,239
Once he has a girlfriend,
he'll understand what's important.

483
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,039
Right, son?

484
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,960
Tell me,

485
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,340
Old Wang's son is half-paralyzed.

486
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,079
Do you have anything to do with it?

487
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:38,679
Who? I don't know him.

488
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,920
It's best that way.

489
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,399
Let's go, Little Jealousy. Go home.

490
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,919
Leaving again. I don't even know
whom he takes after.

491
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,560
What do you think?

492
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,519
<i>You finally appeared.</i>

493
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,879
Shuai, you are still here?

494
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,359
I forgot you like men.

495
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,039
Are you avoiding suspicion
or deliberately seducing me?

496
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,160
Sorry.

497
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,039
What happened? It's like someone owes you money.

498
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,559
Don't mention it.

499
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,960
Can't do this live stream job.
My device was taken.

500
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,039
Then don't.

501
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,680
Are there any other jobs I can do?

502
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,519
I have a relative with a truck.

503
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:32,599
He usually delivers some goods.
Why don't you join him?

504
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:35,600
Payment by the task, and the time is flexible.

505
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,280
This works.

506
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,760
Sorry.

507
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,640
Recovered?

508
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,120
Seeing you, I recovered.

509
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,720
Cheesy.

510
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,840
Aren't you cold?

511
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,560
Of course, I'm feeling cold.

512
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,800
There's a python in my car.

513
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,680
I like snakes. I'll go check.

514
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,760
This snake is really cute.

515
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,000
<i>Okay, I'll use you to comfort my dad</i>

516
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,999
<i>and take back my snakes.</i>

517
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,079
We've searched everywhere we could,
and someone is watching the chairman's car.

518
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,360
But his routine is regular every day.

519
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,600
Except for the company and home,
he hasn't gone anywhere else.

520
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,920
Is it possible that they're in the company?

521
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,450
No way.

522
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,360
With this amount of snakes,

523
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,599
he has to prepare a large space
and dedicated people.

524
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,400
If they're in the company, we must hear some news.

525
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,312
Did you forget?

526
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:26,240
The company built a new storage base.

527
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,519
Wu.

528
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,199
You're the person
recommended by Shuai, so I trust you.

529
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,840
Just a reminder,
this batch of goods is very important.

530
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,280
You need the chairman's approval slip
to unload the goods.

531
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,840
Don't worry.

532
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,880
I won't open this for anyone.

533
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,079
I'm serious.

534
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,360
Alright, I trust you.

535
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,160
Here.

536
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,519
Okay, stop.

537
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,479
Bro.

538
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:11,039
Here you are.

539
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,599
What's in the car? Open it and see.

540
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,880
Who are you? Why should I open it for you?

541
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,800
The chairman said this batch of goods
cannot be opened by anyone.

542
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,560
Mr. Chi, found the snakes.

543
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,719
He's one of Junior Chi's people,
just open it and show him.

544
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,239
What?

545
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,800
No matter who, I won't open it.

546
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,919
Wasting my time.

547
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,319
Gang.

548
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,079
Come on, pry it open.

549
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,400
Don't open it.

550
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,199
I promised that no matter who, no one can open it.

551
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,760
What? I can open it.

552
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:10,319
Mr. Chi, it's all parts.

553
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:16,439
Didn't you say you found it?

554
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,960
Who told you to open it?

555
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,760
You filled the car with parts.
Why were you being mysterious?

556
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,760
If I don't get my wages, you…

557
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
It's you again.

558
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,960
What do you want?
Whatever I do, you're always there.

559
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,320
What are you doing?

560
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,319
This is Mr. Chi from the Warehouse Department.

561
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,360
What? I don't care which department you're from.

562
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,519
Compensate me.

563
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:45,519
How much?

564
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,319
500 yuan.

565
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,679
Gang, pay him 5,000.

566
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,479
Come, come over here.

567
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:12,559
Chi Cheng.

568
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:14,519
- She is really beautiful.
- Yes.

569
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,319
Really beautiful.

570
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,920
Why are you here?

571
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,800
I'm afraid once you're off work,
I couldn't catch you.

572
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,600
So sweet.

573
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,800
What? Are you envious?

574
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,760
Do you miss me?

575
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,760
Let's go.

576
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,680
Okay, let's go.

577
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,079
<i>No wonder he's been against me all along,
causing me to mess up several jobs.</i>

578
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,959
<i>So you are Yue Yue's new boyfriend.
You're taking revenge on me for her.</i>

579
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,439
<i>Grudges shall always be avenged.</i>

580
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:44,381
<i>♫ I really want to tell you ♫</i>

581
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:52,384
<i>♫ There's more than just
the sunset and the distant sea ♫</i>

582
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:59,855
<i>♫ If today won't come back again ♫</i>

583
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:06,928
<i>♫ Don't mind the change of day and night ♫</i>

584
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:14,600
<i>♫ I really want to tell you ♫</i>

585
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:21,984
<i>♫ There's more than just stars or mountains ♫</i>

586
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:29,312
<i>♫ The sun rises and sets, you're all I see ♫</i>

587
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:37,312
<i>♫ Not fearing the halt of time ♫</i>

588
00:46:38,076 --> 00:46:43,366
<i>♫ The last night on Earth ♫</i>

589
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,261
<i>♫ I just want to confess to you ♫</i>

590
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:58,848
<i>♫ Get through the doomsday with sincerity ♫</i>

591
00:46:58,848 --> 00:47:06,848
<i>♫ Perhaps no regret ♫</i>

592
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:13,143
<i>♫ The last night on Earth ♫</i>

593
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:20,448
<i>♫ When life turns to dust ♫</i>

594
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:28,352
<i>♫ When seawater kisses the sky ♫</i>

595
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:38,699
<i>♫ I'll take you away without hesitation ♫</i>
