(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,840
(Infatuation is Limitless Tolerance,
Love is Unreasonable Pettiness)

4
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Hello.

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm Wang Shuo.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,040
Hello, I'm Wu Suo Wei.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Wu Suo Wei?

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,840
That's a unique name.

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,680
Why is your name Wu Suo Wei?

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,160
Because it sounds powerful.

11
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,800
Why did you want to see me?

12
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,960
Actually, it's nothing.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,200
I was just thinking...

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
of adding some fixtures
and furniture to the house...

15
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
and came to take a look here.

16
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,400
I think you're mistaken.

17
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
This is an art installation company.

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,040
It's not an interior design company.

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,720
What's the difference?

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
These clothes
are Chi Cheng's, right?

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,320
All these years,

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,160
his taste hasn't changed.

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,320
He still likes black.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
Can I ask you something?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sure.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,360
Do you like Guo Cheng Yu or not?

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,080
It seems like...

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,040
Chi Cheng has told you
a lot about us.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
A little.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,960
Chi Cheng...

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
is a chatterbox indeed.

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,240
He used to nag me all the time.

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,680
He was worse than my mom.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,200
Do you know how petty he was?

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,040
He'd nitpick
over every little thing.

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,600
We fought all the time.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
In our worst fight,

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,040
he even used a knife.

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
So?

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
So it doesn't matter
if I like Guo Cheng Yu or not.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,759
What's important is that...

42
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,960
Chi Cheng was petty about
everything when it came to me.

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
So...

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,000
you don't like Guo Cheng Yu at all.

45
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,040
What is infatuation
and what is love?

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm not as knowledgeable as you.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,240
I can't come up with a conclusion.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,080
Infatuation is limitless tolerance
and forbearance.

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
As for love,

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
it's the opposite.

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,600
It's unreasonable...

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,680
pettiness.

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
You've been there indeed.

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
You're experienced.

55
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,559
You need to work harder, cute guy.

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,080
It's not good
to be spoiled all the time.

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
This is the pin
and address of my home.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
If you're free tomorrow,

59
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,000
come to my place and take a look.

60
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,616
Whatever I need to add to my home,

61
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,680
just name the price.

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,320
It's okay.

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,480
It's on the house.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm sure you'll like it.

65
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
That's too nice of you.

66
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
It's nothing,

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
my senior.

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,720
Why are you still up?

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm imagining you...

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
being a nag.

71
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,440
Wang Shuo went to see you?

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,080
He immediately guessed it right
when I said he was a nag.

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
This tacit understanding is scary.

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,279
Wei Wei.

75
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,880
I've told you many times.

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,160
What I cared about
was what happened, not him.

77
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,120
If I didn't like you,
I would've kicked you out right now.

78
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
I believe you.

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
Tomorrow,

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,360
I have a class reunion to attend.

81
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Go ahead.

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
I won't go if you won't let me.

83
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
No.

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,320
It's nice to have a reunion
with old classmates.

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
School friendships...

86
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,720
are the most sincere.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't lose contact with him.

88
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
If you want to find
a friend like him again,

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
it'll be hard.

90
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,440
Don't wait up for me
if I come home too late.

91
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
Spend more time with your mom.

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

93
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,920
Show-off.

94
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
What a waste of electricity.

95
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,680
Come on. Look at the camera.

96
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a video.

97
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
It's ticklish.

98
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,359
- You're so lovey-dovey. Come on.
- Are you envious?

99
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,479
Come on. Step back more.

100
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Record it properly.

101
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Kiss me on the lips.

102
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,720
That's good.

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,120
- Do you want more?
- More?

104
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,296
Give me an affectionate one.

105
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,080
- An affectionate one?
- An affectionate one.

106
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,720
Just once?

107
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Is that enough?

108
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,160
- More affectionately.
- More affection?

109
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,120
These are all their videos.

110
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
Why are there so many?

111
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,680
You don't have enough wine
in your home for me.

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,520
- You two are so lovey-dovey.
- Cheng Yu.

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,640
Take a picture of us.

114
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,040
Our family of four.

115
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,559
Family of four?

116
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,880
Yes, Yellow Dragon,
Green-Eyed Monster...

117
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,080
Chi Cheng.

118
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
It's so ticklish.

119
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,560
There are so many videos.

120
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
Why are the three of them
in these videos?

121
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
Why is Guo Cheng Yu in it all?

122
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Isn't there one
with just Wang Shuo and Chi Cheng?

123
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,440
Mr. General Offensive.

124
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
Are you calling me?

125
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
Do you dare to kiss Cheng Yu?

126
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
Let me ask you one last question.

127
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,320
Who's more important,
Cheng Yu or me?

128
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,479
Wait. What's wrong with you again?

129
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
What are you thinking?

130
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,520
What's wrong with you?

131
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,960
What are you doing?

132
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Chi Cheng.

133
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,560
He's not in this one.

134
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,240
He's not in this one either.

135
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
He's not here too.

136
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Chi Cheng.

137
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,800
Who's the most important person...

138
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,400
to you?

139
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Chi Cheng.

140
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,480
Say something.

141
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Chi Cheng.

142
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Guo...

143
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,960
Cheng Yu.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,200
(Copying items)

145
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,040
It's 2.5 meters.

146
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,159
My face hasn't healed
from last time yet.

147
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Can you do it or not?

148
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Hello.

149
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
Wang Shuo told me
to come and take measurements.

150
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,639
I…

151
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,759
Why don't we call it a day?

152
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
You two carry on?

153
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Wang Shuo is my brother.

154
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,080
He told me he's getting someone
to take measurements today.

155
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,440
So it's you.

156
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,520
Didn't we meet at the hospital?

157
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,120
Yes. It was me.

158
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
What a coincidence.

159
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,240
- I'll let you get back to work.
- All right.

160
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,960
What are we practicing today?

161
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm done.

162
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,799
Stop.

163
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Are you all right?

164
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,280
- Don't go.
- I'm going home.

165
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,880
Teach me how to box.

166
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,039
Why do you want to learn this?

167
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,999
Someone at home
has been trying to suppress me.

168
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,240
I want to get stronger.

169
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,400
Then I'll counterattack.

170
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,000
If the puppy wants to counterattack,

171
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,560
just ignore the owner.

172
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Wang...

173
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,559
Wang...

174
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Wang...

175
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Wang...

176
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,039
I...

177
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,080
I've visited him already.

178
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Well...

179
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,416
When you come to my house next time,

180
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
I'll teach you boxing.

181
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,040
Okay, it's a deal.

182
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I'm home.

183
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
Where did you go at this hour?

184
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,440
I'm asking you.

185
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,520
I went to Wang Shu's house today.

186
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,440
Why did you go to his house?

187
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,559
They're buying
some art installations...

188
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,840
to decorate their house.

189
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,600
I went to take measurements.

190
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,920
I even met
Wang Shuo's brother today.

191
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,840
What exactly does his brother do?

192
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
I don't know.

193
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,280
Some say he's in the special forces.

194
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120
Some say he's a bodyguard.

195
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,960
But I think...

196
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,760
he's quite gentle with me.

197
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
He's like a chameleon.

198
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,736
He's strong
in the presence of the strong.

199
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,080
In the presence of a dummy,

200
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,480
he becomes simple...

201
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
and calm.

202
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,320
You're calling me a dummy.

203
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
You're not.

204
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
You can tell right away.

205
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,679
Well,

206
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,240
actually, I quite admire him.

207
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
It's true.

208
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,400
I admire him.

209
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,680
Now that you mention it,

210
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
I think he's too perfect.

211
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,359
I'm so lucky.

212
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,640
You know what?
I asked him to be my teacher today.

213
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,600
I plan to learn
some martial arts from him.

214
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,240
That way, I can protect myself...

215
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
and my mom.

216
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Right?

217
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
That's good.

218
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
That's fine.

219
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Aren't you...

220
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,720
angry about it?

221
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,280
Aren't you going
to be petty about it?

222
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,880
If you want to learn, go ahead.

223
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Okay.

224
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,159
- Let me tell you a bad joke.
- Okay.

225
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,480
Well, which animal is the quietest
when it's angry?

226
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,040
- I don't know.
- Gorillas.

227
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Because when gorillas are angry,

228
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,960
they beat their chests.

229
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,120
- Let's go.
- Da Wei.

230
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,000
- Here.
- What's so urgent?

231
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Let me show you a video.

232
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,120
Who's the most important person...

233
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
to you?

234
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,079
Chi Cheng.

235
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,119
Guo Cheng Yu.

236
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,200
Darn it.

237
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,376
Did they really
have a thing back then?

238
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
Say something.

239
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Where did you get this video?

240
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,160
- Chi Cheng.
- I saw it at Wang Shuo's house.

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Back then,

242
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,320
when you said you felt
that they liked each other,

243
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,319
I thought...

244
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,040
you were just making excuses
to reject Guo Cheng Yu.

245
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,840
But now it seems...

246
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,880
Chi Cheng might really
like Guo Cheng Yu.

247
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
But Guo Cheng Yu
doesn't like Chi Cheng.

248
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,640
Or why would he keep filming
lovey-dovey videos for them?

249
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,720
This is getting weirder.

250
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Guo Cheng Yu doesn't like
Chi Cheng or Wang Shuo.

251
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Then why did he sleep
with Wang Shuo?

252
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Why don't you...

253
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,320
ask Guo Cheng Yu?

254
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,160
You want me
to ask my current boyfriend...

255
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
why he slept...

256
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,080
with his best friend's
boyfriend back then?

257
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,800
Isn't that ridiculous?

258
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Actually,

259
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,520
I asked Wang Shuo if he liked
Guo Cheng Yu back then.

260
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
But he kept avoiding the question.

261
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,920
Instead, he led the conversation
to Chi Cheng.

262
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,240
Wang Shuo is quite strange.

263
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
If he likes Chi Cheng,

264
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,480
why did he sleep with Guo Cheng Yu?

265
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,400
It seems like
he's our breakthrough point now.

266
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,080
Only through him...

267
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
can we find out the truth back then.

268
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,880
Wang Shuo is like a viper.

269
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,400
You have to be careful.

270
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,160
Don't let him bite you instead.

271
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Don't worry.

272
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,800
I won't let him get his way.

273
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Who is it?

274
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,680
Why are you here too?

275
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,240
This is my house.

276
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Don't tell me...

277
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,040
you're here to find Chi Cheng.

278
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,320
Not really.

279
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,280
I'm here for your brother.

280
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
What for?

281
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
To practice boxing.

282
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,320
He's sleeping in his room.

283
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,640
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

284
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
What do you think?

285
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,960
Do you like...

286
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,520
these lighting replacements?

287
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
They're okay.

288
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,360
You have good taste.

289
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
If I didn't,

290
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,120
I wouldn't be in this line of work.

291
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,560
Why is your name Wu Suo Wei?

292
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,799
Why do you keep asking
such weird questions?

293
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,440
That's my name
because I want it to be.

294
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,280
And why did you throw the pillow?

295
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's fun.

296
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,480
But you know,

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,240
the three of you had
such a bad relationship back then.

298
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,279
Don't you want to find
a chance to get together...

299
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,520
and talk it out?

300
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,920
If I talk it out...

301
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,240
with Chi Cheng, do you think
he'll get back together with me?

302
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,440
Let me help you think.

303
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
That's tough.

304
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
What if...

305
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
I cause a misunderstanding
between you two?

306
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,760
Why don't you give it a try?

307
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,960
Actually,

308
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm planning to help you two
resolve this issue.

309
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,400
I should thank you then...

310
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,680
for being willing
to help me resolve this.

311
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't get me wrong.

312
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,840
I'm doing this for Chi Cheng.

313
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,640
You're so devoted then.

314
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,960
I'm not as devoted as you,

315
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,680
my senior.

316
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,080
All right,
I'll stop arguing with you.

317
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,680
I'll go and wake up
the sleeping guy.

318
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,640
Thank you.

319
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,320
- Jab.
- Jab.

320
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,240
- Hook.
- Hook.

321
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Guard your head.

322
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,640
- Come on, let's do it faster.
- Okay.

323
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,799
- Jab.
- Jab.

324
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,280
- Hook.
- Hook.

325
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
- Guard your head. Hook.
- Guard my head.

326
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Not bad.

327
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
- Let's practice that.
- Okay.

328
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,600
Come on. Three, two, one.

329
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,240
Jab.

330
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,040
- Hook.
- Hook.

331
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
Let's call it a day.

332
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
You've improved a lot.

333
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Let's continue next time.

334
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,760
Okay, thank you.

335
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
I'll remove it for you.

336
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,879
Are you tired today?

337
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,000
It's okay.

338
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,080
I'll go ahead then.

339
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Bye.

340
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I'll get going.

341
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:41,919
Don't forget to put ice
on your wrists at home.

342
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,240
- Okay.
- Bye.

343
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Bye.

344
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,800
You seem to like him.

345
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,640
Handsome,

346
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
naive,

347
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,280
with big eyes.

348
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,400
He's really cute, right?

349
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Wang Zhen.

350
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,000
Are you mute? I'm talking to you.

351
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
You're right.

352
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,920
Are you making things difficult
on purpose?

353
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,760
What Chi Cheng
said back then was true.

354
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,680
You're a chameleon.

355
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
You become whatever you encounter.

356
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
In front of him,

357
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,720
you've become a pig.

358
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
In front of you,

359
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,160
I just want to beat you up.

360
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
You...

361
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Say that again.

362
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
I... You...

363
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,000
- What's wrong?
- I...

364
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,520
Do you want me...

365
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,840
to whistle and summon a bunch
of snakes to bite you to death?

366
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,760
It's time for your medicine.

367
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,520
Let go of me.

368
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
No.

369
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,400
I don't want to take it.

370
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,080
Wang Zhen!

371
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Wang Zhen!

372
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
You only bully me.

373
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
I'll be honest with you.

374
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,560
If I don't keep praising you
in front of Mom,

375
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,600
you would have been
kicked out of this family.

376
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,439
And now you're even...

377
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,559
- Do you want me to call Mom now?
- Be good.

378
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,360
I'll tell Mom
what you did to me today.

379
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,800
I didn't grow tall
all these years...

380
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,680
because of you.

381
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,200
If you didn't bully me,

382
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,960
can I not be as tall as you?

383
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,840
We both got
the same amount of nutrients.

384
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,079
The nutrients are just
more evenly supplied...

385
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,160
to every part of my body.

386
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
As for you,

387
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
all your nutrients
are used to come up with schemes.

388
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,120
Hey, what are you doing?

389
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
Xiao Shuai, you're here.

390
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,320
I've learned some new moves lately.

391
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,000
You told me to come and watch this?

392
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
My idol taught me this.

393
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Did Guo Cheng Yu tell you
that Wang Shuo has an older brother?

394
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,479
Let me tell you.
Wang Shuo has an older brother.

395
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,880
He's so strong and muscular.

396
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,520
He's bulletproof.

397
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Are you even describing a human?

398
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,479
Why does he sound like Iron Man?

399
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Let me tell you.

400
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:45,679
If he's in front of you,

401
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,359
you won't have any doubts
that I'm telling the truth.

402
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,999
He's so cool.

403
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,960
The indescribable kind, you know?

404
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
You like him.

405
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Maybe.

406
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm warning you.

407
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Don't be stupid.

408
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,640
If Chi Cheng finds out about this,
you'll regret it.

409
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Maybe...

410
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,880
before I get to regret it,

411
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
Chi Cheng will dump me first.

412
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,679
It's fine.

413
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm just giving him an out.

414
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
I want him to be able to find
an excuse to dump me.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,920
I think Chi Cheng's feelings
for you...

416
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
can't be fake.

417
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,080
I still remember...

418
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,160
the time you were strangled
by the snake.

419
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
The things he said to you...

420
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
really touched me.

421
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
If what he said to me moved you,

422
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,840
what he said to other people
can move me too.

423
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,040
He's not faking it with anyone.

424
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,680
Only he knows...

425
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,840
who he's being true to.

426
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Harder.

427
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,760
What did I teach you?

428
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,920
Okay, that's enough.

429
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Come on.

430
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Get up.

431
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Thank you.

432
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,680
Are you busy at work lately?

433
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm busy with
an art installation exhibition.

434
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,519
When you need knowledge,

435
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
that's when you realize
that you didn't study much.

436
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,200
Initially, the art installation
I designed...

437
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,720
would use a specific sound
and movement to be opened.

438
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,720
But after trying a few times,

439
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,999
it could only
either recognize the movement...

440
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,840
or the sound.

441
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,160
It's giving me a headache.

442
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,120
There's probably a problem
with the programming.

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
You know these things?

444
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
I coded a similar installation too.

445
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,160
Back then, a good designer
helped me solve the problem.

446
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,440
I happen to have his business card.

447
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,560
I'll help you look for it.
Try contacting him.

448
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Thank you.

449
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
You're my idol indeed.

450
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,440
(Medical Record, Name: Wang Shuo)

451
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Wait.

452
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,240
No rush. Take your time.

453
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I found it.

454
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,200
- Thank you.
- No worries.

455
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,320
You're a big help.

456
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,520
(Have you solved
the installation problem?)

457
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,399
(Idol Wang Zhen)

458
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,560
I have.

459
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,680
It's time to solve the problem
with people.

460
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,760
(Block contact)

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,800
(Confirm)

462
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,120
(Send message)

463
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
(It's fine now)

464
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,360
Who are you chatting with?

465
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Why is the signal so bad?

466
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,840
This won't do.
I have to go to the bedroom.

467
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,600
I have to see
if it's better in the bedroom.

468
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,800
(Wang Shuo, online)

469
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,240
Did Wu Suo Wei go
to your house this afternoon?

470
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,080
Yes. He was even taught
how to box hands-on.

471
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,040
Put me down.

472
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Harder.

473
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Harder.

474
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:47,359
(Chi Cheng)

475
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,080
He's here right now.

476
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,239
I'll be right there.

477
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Do this.

478
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,800
Stop. Let me take a break.

479
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
Higher.

480
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
That's right.

481
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,680
Palms up.

482
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Harder.

483
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,520
Why are you here?

484
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,360
Wait.

485
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,200
Put me down.

486
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,040
What are you doing?

487
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,200
Will you behave now?

488
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,800
It's not that
I don't want you to go there.

489
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,280
But you can't always stay there.

490
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,496
But I'm afraid
I won't be able to learn it.

491
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Then...

492
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,160
some people...

493
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,320
will bully me.

494
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,920
Who the heck dares to bully you?

495
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
I'll be the first to chop him up.

496
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm afraid if you know who it is,

497
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,680
you can't bear to do that.

498
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
What?

499
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Why aren't you with Guo Cheng Yu?

500
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Who?

501
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Guo Cheng Yu.

502
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,880
I think you two are a good match.

503
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
At least...

504
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,040
better than you and Wang Shuo.

505
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
You still won't behave, won't you?

506
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,999
Again?

507
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,040
You...

508
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,080
You still won't behave yourself.

509
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Stop it.

510
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,720
The early symptoms
of schizophrenia...

511
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,720
are paranoia,
extreme personality changes,

512
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,160
and neurasthenia.

513
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,679
The influencing factors
are biological,

514
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,759
environmental, and psychological.

515
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,439
I'm sorry. This is urgent.

516
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,720
Please dismiss your class first.

517
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,000
- Okay?
- Let's go.

518
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Come on.

519
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:48,401
- Xiao Shuai, you're a doctor.
- I'm training them.

520
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,281
Check this. This was Wang Shuo's
medical record back then.

521
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,840
Analyze it for me.

522
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,640
"Bipolar disorder."

523
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,280
"Severe anxiety."

524
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,160
The year Meng Tao and I broke up,

525
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,760
I had similar symptoms too.

526
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Darn it.

527
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,840
Wang Shuo's condition
was even worse than mine.

528
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,000
What are the symptoms
of these illnesses?

529
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,200
They usually present...

530
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,320
as alternating episodes
of depression and mania.

531
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,240
In severe cases, there are...

532
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,760
auditory hallucinations, delusions,
and disorderly behavior.

533
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,679
In other words,
Wang Shu might have done...

534
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,600
some extreme things back then
because of that.

535
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,400
It's possible.

536
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Why are you here?

537
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
To see him.

538
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,920
Wait. Why did you come to see him?

539
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
You don't know, do you?

540
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,360
We're very close now.

541
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
We even slept together.

542
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,999
What? When did this happen?

543
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Why didn't you tell me?

544
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,720
It was that day...

545
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,040
Don't tell Xiao Shuai everything
in the future.

546
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,320
What if he betrays you
and tells me about them one day?

547
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Fine.

548
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm not needed here, right?

549
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,920
You two have fun. I'm leaving.

550
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,840
Hey, Da Wei!

551
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,640
Don't go! Da Wei.

552
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
Look at Da Wei.

553
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,440
He's so petty.

554
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,120
That's enough.

555
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,200
Stop pretending.
I can tell what you were doing.

556
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Wu Suo Wei.

557
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Let's play.

558
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
Try again.

559
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Can you dunk?

560
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,080
Darn, that's awesome.

561
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,920
That rebound was so cool.

562
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,800
You're amazing.

563
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,520
How did you do that?

564
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,480
Let me teach you how to dunk.

565
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,800
You'll teach me?
I don't think I can learn it.

566
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,880
How did you know I'm here?

567
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,440
I didn't come here for you.

568
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Give him to me.

569
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Give him back.

570
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,760
I wish I were Green-Eyed Monster,

571
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,800
so you can spoil me
for seven seconds.

572
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,240
You did all those things yourself.

573
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
You can't blame anyone.

574
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Yes.

575
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm cheap.

576
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm shameless.

577
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
I deserve it.

578
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Are you happy now?

579
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
What you are...

580
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,480
has nothing to do with me.

581
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,160
Why did you say
something so hurtful?

582
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,719
We were classmates after all.

583
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,120
We were together for so many years.

584
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Green-Eyed Monster...

585
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,160
is like our son.

586
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,200
We were so close.

587
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,200
Can you not humiliate me?

588
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,400
Give him back to me.

589
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,960
Look. Green-Eyed Monster
doesn't want us to be apart.

590
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,840
In that case,

591
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,880
take me to the snake farm.

592
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,040
I heard there are a lot
of snakes that I left before.

593
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,600
I've been separated from my flesh
and blood for so many years.

594
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,360
It's time for me to visit them.

595
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,320
Okay, Chi Cheng?

596
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Take me there.

597
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm sorry. Wait a moment.

598
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,280
I haven't seen them for so long.
I really miss them.

599
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,040
I wonder if they're eating well.

600
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,400

602
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,280
Hello, are you Zhang Li Ya's family?

603
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,279
There's not enough money
for Zhang Li Ya's hospitalization.

604
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,439
Please come and pay now.

605
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,816
Don't delay her nutrition
and treatment.

606
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,720
Okay. I'm sorry.

607
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,640
I apologize. I'll be right there.

608
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm sorry.

609
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
Get out.

610
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,280
I have urgent matters to attend to.

611
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Get out.

612
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,480
Why are you sitting in the rain?

613
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,680
I've been sitting here...

614
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,120
and it just rained.

615
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
It's not my fault.

616
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,360
Then why didn't you leave?

617
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,360
It's raining everywhere.
Where should I go?

618
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,320
Your brother...

619
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,600
took my Green-Eyed Monster.

620
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Let's go.

621
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,040
I'll get it back for you.
