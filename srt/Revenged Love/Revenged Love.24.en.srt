00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,880
(Episode 24, I Have a Home Again)

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,160
I heard from Cheng Yu...

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,359
that Wu Suo Wei...

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,000
sold the old house
his parents left him...

6
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,880
to pull some strings
for our son this time.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
So what?

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,760
He's relying on Chi Cheng.

9
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
When Chi Cheng comes out,

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,560
and his company recovers,

11
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,160
he can buy so many houses.

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,640
That's easy for you to say.

13
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,440
You can buy a house,

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,880
but can you buy memories?

15
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,696
Let's go to the Cultural Square.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Why are we going there?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
You'll know when we get there.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
What would you like, kid?

19
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,759
- I want this.
- All right.

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Here you go.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,136
- You're welcome.
- Here's the payment.

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,760
- Okay. Thank you.
- Business is good.

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
- Let's go.
- I'm not going.

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,359
What about you? How's your business?

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
It's okay today.

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Xiao Wu.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Mrs. Chi.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Why are you here?

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
What I said last time
was a bit harsh.

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,999
Don't take it to heart.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,160
(Blowing Sugar Figure)

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,599
If you need anything, tell me.

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,736
I'll give you money.
Don't set up a stall here anymore.

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,800
There's no need, Mrs. Chi.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
I'm also here to experience life.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,720
Being in the office every day
is depressing too.

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,416
Mrs. Chi,
are you in a hurry to leave?

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
If not,

40
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,601
I'll make you a sugar figure.

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
- Sure.
- All right.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,480
Come on. Let's start making it.

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
Here, Mrs. Chi.

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
It's so pretty.

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,016
How did you know I was born
in the Year of the Rabbit?

46
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Chi Cheng told me.

47
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
How thoughtful of you.

48
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
What's this junk?

49
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Junk?

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
Try blowing one for me.

51
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,200
I think this time,

52
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,200
we really can't stop them anymore.

53
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
It's all your fault.

54
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,439
If you let the family lawyer
and company's Finance Department...

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,760
help out a bit,

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
maybe Chi Cheng can be out now.

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,800
But you won't do anything.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is great.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,120
Now, we owe him a favor.

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Why do we owe him one?

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,080
Chi Cheng is imprisoned
because of him.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,440
It's what he should do.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Besides,

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I didn't expect...

65
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,400
this stingy guy...

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,080
to be so generous this time.

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
You can't accomplish anything.

68
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
What are you doing?

69
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,240
You darn old man.

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Aren't you ashamed?

71
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
It's quite sweet.

72
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,280
You ate it. Of course it's sweet.

73
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Try it.

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Here.

75
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
Thank you, sir.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're welcome.

77
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,880
(Blowing Sugar Figure)

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,240
I just met him with the lawyer.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
What did he say?

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,640
(I don't hate you.
I can't bear for you to do that)

81
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
"I don't hate you."

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,320
"I can't bear for you to do that."

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,600
The verdict will be out tomorrow.

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,600
Cheng Yu said
we'll go there together.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll pass.

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,720
My stall is open
for business tomorrow.

87
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
How can you not go?

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,160
If Chi Cheng comes out,

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,840
you'll be the first person...

90
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
he wants to see.

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
What if he can't get out?

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,480
You guys go in my place.

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
In that kind of occasion,

94
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,640
I really don't know
how to face Chi Cheng's parents.

95
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Godfather, Godmother.

96
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,079
He's a good friend of mine
and Chi Cheng's,

97
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Xiao Shuai.

98
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Don't worry.

100
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
Chi Cheng will surely be fine.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,160
I'm not worried at all.

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,919
I should let this brat suffer more.

103
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
You're not worried?

104
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,096
Go home if you're not worried.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,240
Go. Go away.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
It's fine, Godmother.

107

(The First Prosecutor's Office)

108
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,640
(Blowing Sugar Figure)

109
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,039
(What happened? What are you doing?)

110
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
(Where is he? Is he okay?)

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,520
- Sir, one sugar figure.
- Get it yourself.

112
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,416
(Lingchuan People's Procuratorate
First Prosecutor's Office)

113
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
You can go now.

114
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Chi Cheng.

115
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Chi Cheng!

116
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Chi Cheng!

117
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,120
Don't say bad things to our son.

118
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,496
He's already been through so much.

119
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
I...

120
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
Buddy, you've gained weight.

121
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
And you've lost weight.

122
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
How are you?

123
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm fine now. He turned himself in.

124
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
That's good.

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Son.

126
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,880
- Mom.
- It's okay now.

127
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Don't worry.

128
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Where's Wei Wei?

129
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,160
At this hour,
he should still be selling candy.

130
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I'll inform him now.

131
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Dad.

132
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Give me the car key.

133
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,640
That person turned himself in.

134
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
He...

135
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
- Godfather, Godmother.
- Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

136
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,656
If there's nothing else,
we'll get going.

137
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
We'll go ahead.

138
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Well...

139
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,640
(Chi Cheng is fine now)

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Yes!

141
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
You scared me to death.
You're crazy.

142
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,959
I want this!

143
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,519
- Here. There's enough for everyone.
- I want this one!

144
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,879
- Don't fight over it.
- I want this.

145
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,256
- Everyone gets one.
- Thank you, sir.

146
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,679
- Thank you, sir.
- Take it one by one.

147
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Thank you, sir.

148
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Look at mine.

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Why are there two missing?

150
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,640
Jiang Xiao Shuai,
what are you doing?

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Guo Cheng Yu.

152
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,896
Why don't you do something
about Jiang Xiao Shuai?

153
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Do something?

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
- Come on!
- Come on!

155
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
You wicked couple!

156
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,160
You're bullying me
while Chi Cheng's not here!

157
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Stop!

158
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Stop shooting!

159
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Go.

160
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Don't come near me.

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,240
Why are you two here too?

162
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Let's go.

163
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Help!

164
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Save me!

165
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Don't shoot at my face.

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
It hurts.

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
You...

168
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,999
Help me!

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,680
You rascals kick me when I'm down.

170
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,200
Somebody! Help!

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Get up.

172
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Move!

173
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Cheng Yu!

174
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Take this big water ball!

175
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,560
Put me down, Cheng Yu.

176
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
You know what? Before you came,

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
those four people
bullied me so much.

178
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,719
They shot water on my head
and into my mouth.

179
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
I still can't eat dinner now.

180
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,799
Thank goodness you came...

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,840
and defeated them...

182
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Thank you.

183
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,320
Why are you thanking me?

184
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,360
With our relationship,
why are you thanking me?

185
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,000
We must keep clear accounts,
even with your own brother.

186
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,760
Are we brothers?

187
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,080
We're a couple.

188
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,479
Do couples keep clear accounts?

189
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
What are you doing?

190
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,800
So you know we're a couple.

191
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,440
Call me Hubby.

192
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Say it.

193
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,320
- Say it.
- Get lost!

194
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
- Say it.
- Get lost!

195
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Don't move.

196
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm sleepy now. I want to sleep.

197
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Go to sleep.

198
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,280
I'm warning you, don't try anything.

199
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Lie down.

200
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Go to sleep.

201
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,480
Da Wei, it's time to eat.

202
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Chi Cheng.

203
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
It's time to eat.

204
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
He's not awake yet?

205
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
What are you doing?

206
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,680
Let me see if he's still alive.

207
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
He's still alive.

208
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
He's not awake yet?

209
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Yes.

210
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,040
Chi Cheng can't skip
his meals either.

211
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,280
Every time we cook,
we put it in the fridge.

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,080
The fridge is almost full.

213
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
He must let go of Da Wei first.

214
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,400
He's been holding Da Wei
for one whole day,

215
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
and he won't come out.

216
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,560
It's so cheesy.

217
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
This won't do.

218
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,760
I'll deliver it to them directly.

219
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Eat this.

220
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,880
You're a real...

221
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
man.

222
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Who is he?

223
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,720
He's your ancestor.

224
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Remember to eat.

225
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Just wait.

226
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,760
You're finally awake.

227
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,880
Here. Try it.

228
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Cheng Yu made it.

229
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,880
Cheng Yu is so good at cooking.

230
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,120
Here comes my happy life.

231
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,760
Your happiness...

232
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,960
is coming to an end.

233
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Hello, Cheng Yu?

234
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
He's awake.

235
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:35,576
You don't have to come
and cook anymore.

236
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Okay. I finally don't have
to bother with that.

237
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,079
- Hey, it's different!
- It's okay, Wei Wei.

238
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,920
I'll take you
to a Michelin-starred restaurant.

239
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,280
Hold on. I'll be right there.

240
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Xiao Shuai.

241
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
I have something to do.

242
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Order takeout for tonight.

243
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Eat by yourself.

244
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I...

245
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,160
Goodness.

246
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,080
Can I join you?

247
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Please.

248
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Should we let him join?

249
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
It's up to you.

250
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
(Medical Area
Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out)

251
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,320
Didn't I tell you to ask
the designer to do as I instructed?

252
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Cheng Yu.

253
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Xiao Shuai.

254
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,560
Why... Why are you here?

255
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,520
Aren't you with Wu Suo Wei?

256
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
Wu Suo Wei is busy dating.

257
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
He doesn't have time for me.

258
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,560
Why did you come out
of this restaurant's back door?

259
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,760
I thought you didn't like
the food here.

260
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,440
This restaurant
doesn't make good food,

261
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
so...

262
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm going to save it.

263
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,160
Are you going to take over
and be its chef?

264
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Look at you.

265
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,640
I only cook for you.

266
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
But you're quite smart.

267
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
You're half right.

268
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
The other half...

269
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,920
is for you to save.

270
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Me?

271
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,240
What do I need to save?

272
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Because...

273
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
this will be...

274
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,200
your clinic from now on.

275
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,560
Of course you need
to be in charge of it.

276
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Guo Cheng Yu.

277
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,640
What is the meaning of this?

278
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,239
Haven't you always wanted...

279
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,320
to expand the clinic...

280
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
and take on more patients?

281
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,000
I want to help you...

282
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
realize this wish.

283
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
How did you know that?

284
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
You came on the day...

285
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
we had the free clinic?

286
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Congratulations.

287
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
You've won the lottery.

288
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,440
I've thought things through.

289
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
We can take turns...

290
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,920
renovating these two places.

291
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,480
This way, it won't hold you back
from seeing patients.

292
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,440
But your medicine cabinet...

293
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
is really built too high.

294
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,296
Every time you take medicine
from the third row,

295
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,120
you have to stand on your tiptoes
to reach it.

296
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,480
So this is a good opportunity
to redesign it.

297
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
And Wu Suo Wei's bedroom.

298
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,920
Anyway, he won't need it anymore.

299
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,640
This is a good opportunity
to turn it...

300
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,160
into a lounge for the medical staff.

301
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Here.

302
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
And this rooftop.

303
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,560
From now on, it belongs to us.

304
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Whenever you want to,

305
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,000
you can come any time.

306
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
No one will disturb you.

307
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
What's wrong?

308
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Nothing.

309
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
It's too windy.

310
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,200
Sand got into my eyes.

311
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

312
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,520
Could it be that you feel moved?

313
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,320
You sold the snake farm...

314
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,920
to expand the clinic, right?

315
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,760
Consider it my betrothal gift.

316
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,839
Actually,

317
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,720
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

318
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
For a betrothal gift,

319
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,880
I have to give you...

320
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,600
what you really need.

321
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
As long as you like it,

322
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,720
everything is worth it.

323
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
But...

324
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
But I haven't done anything for you.

325
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Silly guy.

326
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
It's okay.

327
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
I understand.

328
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
You...

329
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:57,920
care about the world.

330
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,760
You practice medicine
to treat the sick.

331
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Shuai Shuai.

332
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
You're responsible...

333
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
for loving the world.

334
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm responsible for loving you.

335
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Mr. Guo!

336
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,560
The wall is painted.

337
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,680
Carry on.

338
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Then...

339
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
let's carry on?

340
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,480
It flipped over. It blew up.

341
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,400
I have a Transformer.

342
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Mr. and Mrs. Chi.

343
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,560
- You're here.
- A paper airplane.

344
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,320
- Dou Dou.
- It's going to crash.

345
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,480
Dou Dou.

346
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Aunt.

347
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,960
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

348
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,399
Do you miss your toys or me?

349
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
I miss you.

350
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
I didn't dote on you for nothing.

351
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,240
Didn't I break this plane...

352
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,120
when I was little?

353
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,040
Dou Dou wanted to play with it.

354
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,440
- You wanted to take it out.
- Dou Dou.

355
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,280
You're lying.

356
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,640
- Come on, Dou Dou.
- All right.

357
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Go ahead and play.

358
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
I'll play with you.

359
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
What do you want to play?

360
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Dou Dou.

361
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Here.

362
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:15,600
I've prepared new equipment for you.

363
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Which one do you want?

364
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Move over.

365
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
Why did you bring him here?

366
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
To sleep.

367
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,800
Then may I ask
why he's sleeping with us?

368
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,119
He's a kid.

369
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,559
And he's alone
in someone else's house.

370
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
He'll be scared sleeping alone.

371
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,560
Put him on the side.

372
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,040
Don't put him in the middle.

373
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,440
Why not?

374
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,056
When I hug you while I'm sleeping,
what if I squish him?

375
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,200
Then why are you hugging me?

376
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,480
Don't I hug you
when I sleep every day?

377
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,480
You don't have to hug me today.

378
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,880
I have him.
His little face is so soft.

379
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Wu Suo Wei.

380
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,160
I'm jealous.

381
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
So?

382
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,240
Okay. Fine.

383
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,680
Even if my sister
doesn't pick him up tomorrow,

384
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,600
I'll still take him home.

385
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Dou Dou, go to sleep.

386
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Wu Suo Wei.

387
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Let's sleep.

388
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Let's sleep.

389
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Jia Li.

390
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
You're back.

391
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Come on.

392
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,720
- Dou Dou.
- Mom.

393
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I'll get going, Jia Li.

394
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,320
You're not eating here at home?

395
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Maybe next time.

396
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
I have something
to take care of later.

397
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,160
Okay. Drive safely then.

398
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
I'll get going, Dou Dou.

399
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,840
- Bye, Uncle.
- Bye.

400
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,280
- I'll get going, Jia Li.
- Bye.

401
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Dou Dou.

402
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,399
How have you been
these past two days?

403
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Good.

404
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
Where are you taking me?

405
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,359
What have you been up to lately?

406
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,480
You've been going out often.

407
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Are you selling me off?

408
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Who would want you?

409
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Even if I throw you out
on the street,

410
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
no one would want you.

411
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Let's go.

412
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
- Be careful.
- I can't see.

413
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Am I that worthless?

414
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
You're a money-losing guy.

415
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Where...

416
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
did you bring me?

417
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Here.

418
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Ready?

419
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What's wrong?

420
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,160
You don't recognize your own house?

421
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
When did you buy it?

422
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Last week.

423
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,159
You know what? In my dream,

424
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,176
I dreamed that this tree...

425
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,240
was made into furniture.

426
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,640
Good thing it's not real.

427
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,120
Thank goodness it's not!

428
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
Don't worry.

429
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,319
With me around, nothing will change.

430
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Thank you!

431
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,000
Isn't this yard great?

432
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Name your price.

433
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,960
If it's less than this,
I'm not selling it.

434
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Okay.

435
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,120
Seven million yuan is fine.

436
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But on one condition.

437
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,800
Nothing in the house
can be taken away.

438
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
- Don't worry.
- Rest assured.

439
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,200
- Nothing has been touched.
- That's right.

440
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,079
I think this tree is so lush.

441
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
- Right?
- Yes.

442
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
- This tree is so nice.
- If I had known, I would have...

443
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:47,936
bought this house earlier.

444
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,199
We could've had loquats earlier.

445
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
- Right?
- Yes.

446
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
- Loquats are really sweet, right?
- Yes.

447
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Where's the tree?

448
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,120
- Tree? Isn't this the tree?
- Isn't it this one?

449
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,520
Do you think I'm a fool?

450
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,720
I'm talking about the old tree.

451
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,640
The old tree?

452
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,800
We... We sold it.

453
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
To whom?

454
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,319
I don't know either.

455
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,560
Anyway, someone came...

456
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,800
and said he wanted the tree.

457
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,000
So I let him take it away.

458
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
That's right.

459
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,880
- Wait.
- Wait.

460
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm at the pear orchard.
I don't see it.

461
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
Check the next one for me.
Call me if there's news.

462
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,600
Pull up this image for me.

463
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,880
- Is that the one?
- No.

464
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,520
Doesn't that look like it?

465
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,520
That doesn't look like it at all.

466
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Let's search elsewhere.

467
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,880
(Tree Search Notice!)

468
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
You're up?

469
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
- Let's go.
- I'm up.

470
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,759
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

471
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Come on. Let's eat.

472
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Not this one.

473
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
I found it.

474
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,000
I think a car passed by here.

475
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Zoom in on this.

476
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,280
I got this tree after it's been
resold so many times.

477
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,536
I can't believe
you found this place.

478
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm impressed.

479
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
What's wrong?

480
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,360
I think I got stung by a bug.

481
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,799
I told you not to climb the tree.

482
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
You just had to do it.

483
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Let me see.

484
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Chi Cheng.

485
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
How long have we been together?

486
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,120
A year and two months.

487
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,760
A year and two months?

488
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
Then why do I feel like...

489
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,240
we've only been together
for a few days?

490
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
The passion...

491
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
hasn't waned at all.

492
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,680
That's because your reflex arc
is longer.

493
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,199
What should I do then...

494
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,000
to make you have
long reflex arcs like me?

495
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,400
If you maintain this state...

496
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,320
and keep loving me,

497
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,240
I won't have to use my reflex.

498
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,520
I have a home again.

499
