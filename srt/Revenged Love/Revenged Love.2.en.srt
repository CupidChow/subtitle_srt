You are really amazing. You've rejuvenated Mr. Li.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,799
Not because of me, but the mirror.

19
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,840
Mirror?

20
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,760
What's wrong, Wei?

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,679
Say something.

22
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,840
I want to be alone for a while.

23

I'm okay.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,000

Yes.

26

Why are you here again?

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,919
This is a clinic, can't I come here?

What's your problem?

What illness are you good at treating?
I can get one now.

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,519
It's lunch break now, temporarily closed.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Such a small clinic,
yet you still have lunch break?

32
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,800
What do you want?

33
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,439

Can you use your skills to rejuvenate me?

36
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm best at treating shameless guys.

37

Are you fine now?

38
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,719
Yes.

Are you alright?

That guy likes you, right?

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,839
He came to the clinic just to pursue you, right?

43
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,240
Wait, Wei, you misunderstood me.

44
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,199
Shuai, please accept me as your disciple.

45
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,120
- Teach me, please.
- Teach you what?

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,040
Teach me how to attract men.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,920
What? Attract whom?

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,319
Attract the current boyfriend of my ex-girlfriend.

49
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,160
Since little, no one dared
to hit me except Chi Cheng.

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,079
Yes, don't provoke him.

51
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,480
I can tell that he is tough.

52
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,040
With so many people around you pleasing you,
why bother going to him?

53
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,288
You know nothing.

54
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:03,079
There's thrill

55
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,400
in winning over his heart.

56
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,279
Besides, I need to get him now.

57
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,959
If Chi Cheng gets him,

58
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,079
Chi Cheng would suffer.

59
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,800
That's it.

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,879
This is just so despicable.

61
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,959
Yes.

62
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,360
A colleague in the Warehouse Department
said that he has dated guys before.

63
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
If I attract him,

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Yue Yue will definitely feel miserable.

65
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,959
When Chi Cheng finds out the truth,
he will definitely be hopping mad.

66
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,279
Killing two birds with one stone.

67
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,199
- Are you going to pursue him?
- No.

68
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
I plan to make him pursue me instead.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
If he's like that man just now,

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,199
willing to take a slap from me to pursue me,

71
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,519
that would be quite satisfying.

72
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,839
Impressive.

73
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,120

74
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,240

I earnestly ask you to help me.

If you had a girlfriend of three years,

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,559
and you saw her kissing another man,
you'd understand my pain right now.

79
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,639

80
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,600
and investigate his family background
and love history thoroughly,

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,000
like his personality, hobbies, and so forth,

82

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000

He's familiar with the snake market
and often hosts snake fights.

He has a yellow python, named Huang Long,

chairman of Yuanduan Machinery
Manufacturing Group.

98

Chi Yuan Duan is his father.

99
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,680
No wonder he can go to any department he wants.

100

00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,359
I am.

00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,879
You look quite decent.

160
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,599
But you need to change your style of dressing.

161
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,319
You are dressing too straight now,
need to be more flashy.

162
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,200
<i>Chi Cheng is very wild,
and we can tell he's aggressive.</i>

163
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,519
<i>So, you need to be coquettish.</i>

164
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,000
Behind the neck. Your butt, lift it.

165
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Lift your butt.

166
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000

Go.

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,039
It's your first time here?
I've never seen you before.

170
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,120
Look at your slim waist.

171
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,840
Don't touch me.

Don't touch you?

173
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,799
If I had a waist like yours,
many men would pursue me.

174
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,279
- What are you pretending?
- I'm a straight man.

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,079
Dressing so flamboyantly.

176
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,600

no matter how I'm being coquettish,
he won't look at me directly.

178
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,559

179
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,200
Don't say so, cheer up.

180
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,040

362
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,559
I'm asking you a question.

363
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,119
No more.

364
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,319
Go buy some then.

365
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,119
No.

366
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,760
Why haven't you come to play basketball
these past two days?

367
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,919
I didn't want to go.

368
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,319
Then why did you want to play before?

369
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,720
Speak.

370
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,800
Don't get that close.
He has a cold, and you might catch it.

371
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,960
You caught a cold?

372
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,079
Don't listen to him, I'm perfectly fine.

373
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,640
Going out during the storm
and coming back all sweaty.

374
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
How can you not catch a cold?

375
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,079
Just to catch a wild mouse for your pet.

376
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,960
He even fell into the ditch,
came back with a high fever of 40 degrees.

377
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,960
Shuai, stop it.

378
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,799
What a fool.

379
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,480
Wearing worn shorts,
stuffing all the good things into others' pockets.

380
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,599
You catch a cold, don't dare go out,
afraid of infecting others.

381
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,839
Mr. Strong, tell me,
if he really froze to death in the ditch,

382
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,040
what a huge loss to the world.

383
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,680
Wu.

384
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,960
<i>Just in time.</i>

385
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,759
Wu, our snakes have died another dozen.

386
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,720
- What?
- Go check it out.

387
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,520
Why?

388
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,399
This batch of snakes won't live long.

389
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,720
Why?

390
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,079
When I bought them,
my master said this batch of snakes is wild,

391
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,299
and needs wild feed.

392
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,039
I've been feeding them wild feed all along,

393
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,759
yet I only fed them artificial feed twice.

394
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:28,759
It's not about the feed, but the snake breed.

395
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,000
You've been fooled.

396
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,039
Impossible.

397
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,599
I had been an apprentice there for so long,
and I got familiar with them.

398
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,279
They couldn't have fooled me.
The snakes must have eaten something wrong.

399
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,400
Which one?

400
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,519
Wang's Snake Farm.

401
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,520
Go inquire. They have an excellent reputation.

402
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,000
Wait here.

403
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,400
<i>Wu Suo Wei, terrible.</i>

404
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,720
<i>More snakes have died.</i>

405
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,759
No worries, just keep an eye for me.

406
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,519
If there's a loss, it's on me.
If there's a profit, I'll share it with you.

407
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,359
Don't worry, thanks for your hard work.

408
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,279
<i>What's going on? Is it about your techniques?</i>

409
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,039
<i>No, that batch of snakes had problems.</i>

410
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,119
<i>Mixed with sand.</i>

411
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,519
<i>Within a month, they'll all die.</i>

412
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,599
<i>Oh my.</i>

413
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,760
<i>Nowadays, breeders are so despicable?</i>

414
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,400
<i>Most breeders nowadays</i>

415
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,360
<i>recruit apprentices under the pretense
of teaching breeding techniques.</i>

416
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,920
<i>Their real aim is to collect tuition fees</i>

417
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,760
<i>and sell snakes hatchlings at high prices.</i>

418
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,919
<i>Then why did you still buy them?</i>

419
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,480
<i>To lure him in.</i>

420
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,039
<i>To approach him,</i>

421
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:38,199
<i>you make a loss-making deal?</i>

422
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,559
<i>No, as long as Chi Cheng is involved,
there won't be a loss.</i>

423
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:46,359
<i>Then won't all the effort you put in be in vain?</i>

424
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,079
<i>No, being blindly kind
will only make people think you're fake.</i>

425
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,320
<i>On the contrary, some easily uncovered evils</i>

426
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,640
<i>actually makes you seem more charming.</i>

427
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,519
<i>He took the bait, as expected.</i>

428
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,999
I'm leaving.

429
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,039
Mr. Chi, why are you smiling?

430
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,399
Someone's about to play some tricks.

431
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,630
<i>♫ I really want to tell you ♫</i>

432
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:19,633
<i>♫ There's more than just
the sunset and the distant sea ♫</i>

433
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:27,104
<i>♫ If today won't come back again ♫</i>

434
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:34,177
<i>♫ Don't mind the change of day and night ♫</i>

435
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:41,849
<i>♫ I really want to tell you ♫</i>

436
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:49,233
<i>♫ There's more than just stars or mountains ♫</i>

437
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:56,561
<i>♫ The sun rises and sets, you're all I see ♫</i>

438
00:36:56,561 --> 00:37:04,561
<i>♫ Not fearing the halt of time ♫</i>

439
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:10,615
<i>♫ The last night on Earth ♫</i>

440
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:18,510
<i>♫ I just want to confess to you ♫</i>

441
00:37:20,064 --> 00:37:26,097
<i>♫ Get through the doomsday with sincerity ♫</i>

442
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:34,097
<i>♫ Perhaps no regret ♫</i>

443
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:40,392
<i>♫ The last night on Earth ♫</i>

444
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:47,697
<i>♫ When life turns to dust ♫</i>

445
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:55,601
<i>♫ When seawater kisses the sky ♫</i>

446
00:37:55,601 --> 00:38:05,948
<i>♫ I'll take you away without hesitation ♫</i>
