00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 8,
I Decide Who You're Missing)

3
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,880
I really want to kill you.

4
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm the one who wants to kill you.

5
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
It's the middle of the night.

6
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
What are you doing?

7
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
No.

8
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:46,201
Did he discover something?

9
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,240
Did Guo Cheng Yu tell him?

10
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,200
Even if Guo Cheng Yu
didn't tell him,

11
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Yue Yue is with him every day.

12
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,680
Could she have let something slip?

13
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Hey.

14
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Why...

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,080
do you want to kill me?

16
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,120
You're a troublemaker.

17
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
How...

18
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,840
How did I trouble you?

19
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
You don't even know?

20
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Spare me.

21
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
You're so evil.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,320
How can I spare you so easily?

23
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Then...

24
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
Then what do you want?

25
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
You tell me.

26
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
I...

27
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,280
Do you miss me?

28
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,960
I want to chop you up.

29
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,880
Go ahead.

30
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
Come and chop me up.

31
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Idiot.

32
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Darn it.

33
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,920
What about this?

34
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
It's okay.

35
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll wait for you outside.

36
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Wait.

37
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,720
This, this, and these.

38
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Wrap them all up for me.

39
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,920
Do you have bigger ones?

40
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
Stress-relieving toys, 10 yuan each.

41
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
I'll take all of them.

42
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Okay.

43
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,520
It used to take you
five minutes to wash up.

44
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,480
Now, 50 minutes isn't even enough.

45
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,920
Yes.

46
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,600
Why am I so pretentious now?

47
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,840
This is not a good sign.

48
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
This won't do.

49
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,720
I need to change back.

50
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
It's been six whole days.

51
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,080
I haven't heard from him
in six days.

52
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
He must be having so much fun.

53
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
But that makes sense.

54
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,840
He eats and drinks well
with nice scenery to enjoy.

55
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,960
If I were him,
I wouldn't come back either.

56
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Chi Cheng.

57
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,160
Chi Cheng.

58
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You...

59
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
You...

60
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
When did you get here?

61
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,160
Since the moment you missed me.

62
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,040
How do you know
you're the one I'm missing?

63
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
What are you doing?

64
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
You...

65
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,480
I decide...

66
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
who you're missing.

67
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
What are you doing?

68
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm warning you, don't mess around.

69
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Move inside.

70
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,600
Let's just sleep.

71
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
No.

72
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,520
Am I too immersed in my acting?

73
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Let me ask you.

74
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
What is this?

75
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,440
Are you stupid or am I?

76
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Chopsticks.

77
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
No.

78
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,640
In my hand, it can turn into
an art installation the next day.

79
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,440
Here we go again.

80
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
An art installation?

81
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,880
I plan to start
an art installation company.

82
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,256
You don't know about that, do you?

83
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,840
An art installation uses art,

84
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
lights,

85
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
and sounds...

86
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,920
to make something artistic.

87
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,359
The vivarium I made
for Green-Eyed Monster is also one.

88
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,040
But it's more practical.

89
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,160
It's not the same.

90
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
With your brain,

91
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
are you sure you can figure it out?

92
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,680
Why can't I?

93
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
You've been to my house,
haven't you?

94
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,080
- Yes.
- Is it nice?

95
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Yes.

96
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Let me tell you.

97
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:47,760
I made the flower pots,
tables, chairs, lamps,

98
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,359
and cutlery myself.

99
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Am I incredible or what?

100
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,959
I told you.

101
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,639
I've always been artistic.

102
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,119
Also, I did some related work
at my previous company.

103
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,399
I did a lot of research...

104
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,879
and found out that art nowadays...

105
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,879
is mostly designed
for big exhibitions.

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,479
I don't want that.
I want to make small, beautiful,

107
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,600
enjoyable, and practical things.

108
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,759
Anyone who's interested in art...

109
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
can come to buy from me
according to their needs.

110
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,960
Art is...

111
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,239
It's classless.

112
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,640
Everyone can use it.

113
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,040
Are you listening to me?

114
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,360
That's a good idea.

115
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
What about you?

116
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,160
I...

117
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
have my own plans.

118
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Let's eat.

119
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
This is for you.

120
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
Use it however you want.

121
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I don't want it.

122
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
Do you think
I'm a gigolo you're keeping?

123
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
You'll need a lot of money
to start a business.

124
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,240
Just think of it as my investment.

125
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
I'm going to work.

126
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Pay the bill.

127
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,040
He left me money for the bill.

128
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Sir.

129
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Go home.

130
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,240
The snakes are all sold.

131
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,640
A big client came last time...

132
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,040
and bought all the snakes.

133
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,679
This time,
I'm not here to buy snake eggs.

134
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm here to buy female snakes.

135
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,239
- Female snakes?
- Yes.

136
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,360
I really like the snake eggs
you sold me last time.

137
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,800
So this time, I'm planning
to buy the female snake.

138
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,359
Help me send a message to the guard.

139
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,959
See if he can get
the female snake out.

140
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,600
That's impossible.
Absolutely impossible.

141
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,520
There are several lines
of defense inside.

142
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,800
Do you think you can get her out
if you want to?

143
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,960
Then how did you get
those snake eggs out?

144
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,319
That's different.

145
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,776
There is a set number
of female snakes.

146
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
They can't lose even one.

147
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
How about this?

148
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,480
I'll find a similar female snake...

149
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
to replace that female snake.

150
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,256
That way, the number of female
snakes will remain the same.

151
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,960
Don't even think about it.
It's impossible.

152
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Sir.

153
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Here.

154
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Take a look.

155
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,919
Sir, if they really discovered it,

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,559
first, the amount remains the same.

157
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,079
Second, the species hasn't changed.

158
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,640
Third, its value hasn't decreased.

159
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Can they really do a DNA test
on that snake?

160
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,319
Sir, please contact
that person for me.

161
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
Don't worry about the rest.

162
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
I'll try my best.

163
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
All right.

164
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,119
I'll wait for your good news.

165
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

166
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,520
Hello, I met
a really big client today.

167
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,600
What a coincidence. I have one too.

168
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,000
This one...

169
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,480
is not only rich,

170
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
but stupid too.

171
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
He said he'd trade me
the exact same one.

172
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,960
Mine too.

173
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,599
Let's still use your place
as a transfer point.

174
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,919
The snake will be delivered to you.
He'll send someone to get them.

175
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,960
He'll still pay us.

176
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,680
Then we'll earn by doing nothing?

177
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,440
(Don't let your son marry
and have kids. We love each other.)

178
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,840
(I've made plans with Chi Cheng.
We're getting married next month.)

179
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,319
Mrs. Chi, Ms. Yue Yue is here.

180
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,679
- Mrs. Chi.
- Yue Yue.

181
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
Come here. Have a seat.

182
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,840
Yue Yue, tell me the truth.

183
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
How is it going
with you and Chi Cheng?

184
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,840
We've always been the same.

185
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,199
We're good.

186
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,120
You didn't argue, did you?

187
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,079
Mrs. Chi, did Chi Cheng
say something to you?

188
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,239
No.

189
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,600
I haven't seen him
since you came last time.

190
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,599
Mrs. Chi, don't worry.

191
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,040
We've always been good.

192
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,400
Everyone has their own temper.

193
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,400
There's always time
to adjust to each other.

194
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,040
As long as we're together,

195
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,640
that's good.

196
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,839
You're so insightful, Yue Yue.

197
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,480
No wonder Chi Cheng likes you.

198
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,280
He has so many girls around him.

199
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,960
You're the first one
he brought home.

200
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
You two should hurry up.

201
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,200
Pick a date
and register your marriage.

202
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,559
Mrs. Chi, isn't it too soon?

203
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,599
No, it's not.

204
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,799
Anyway, sooner or later,

205
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,656
you'll be the daughter-in-law
of the Chi family.

206
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,520
Go to his house tonight.

207
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,360
I'll call him later.

208
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Everyone.

209
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Let me introduce you.

210
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,240
This is my partner, Wu Suo Wei.

211
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Mr. Wu.

212
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Nice to meet you.

213
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,400
This is Mr. Wang
from the Sky Story Design Company.

214
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Mr. Wang.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,520
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

216
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

217
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,040
This is Mr. Teng
from Shuran Art Studio.

218
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,760
- Have a seat.
- Mr. Teng.

219
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,640
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

220
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
And this is Mr. Liu
from Fantasy Space.

221
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,440
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

222
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,840
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

223
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,776
You all know each other now.
Let's cut to the chase.

224
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Let's drink.

225
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,001
- Come on. Let's drink.
- Come.

226
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Young Master Chi.

227
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,000
Mr. Wu,
this is our first time meeting.

228
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,680
Let me toast to you first.

229
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
- Okay.
- Bottoms up.

230
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,440
Don't. Slow down.

231
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
From now on,

232
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,720
I'll need your help
with a lot of things.

233
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll need your help more
in the future.

234
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Have a seat.

235
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
Here, Mr. Wu.

236
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Cheers.

237
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Have a seat.

238
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,320
Drink slowly.

239
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Watch me later. Don't be so nervous.

240
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Let's eat.

241
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Sit down.

242
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,480
What's wrong?

243
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,960
Are you drunk?

244
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,960
Why are you so nice to me?

245
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
(Yue Yue)

246
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,600
I need to take this call.

247
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,520
Right on time.

248
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Don't worry, Er Bao.

249
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,480
I won't hurt you.

250
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,240
My girlfriend will be here soon.

251
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,760
I'll surely pay back...

252
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,880
what I owe you.

253
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Chi Cheng.

254
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Eat.

255
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,720
Why aren't you eating it, jerk?

256
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
Darn it.

257
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,120
If you don't eat it,

258
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,960
I'll still get someone to kill you.

259
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,439
This kind of rat poison
can kill snakes too.

260
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,600
It's just not that toxic.

261
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,720
If snakes like
Green-Eyed Monster eats it,

262
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,199
he'll just vomit and have diarrhea.

263
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,696
But if he takes it for a long time,
he won't make it.

264
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,240
You can't save him
even if you want to.

265
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,439
This person's quite bold,
but stupid.

266
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,776
That person doesn't know
Green-Eyed Monster's habits either.

267
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,081
Otherwise, how would they come up
with such a stupid idea?

268
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
The person
who poisoned him this way...

269
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
must be someone I have
a lot of contact with.

270
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Are you referring...

271
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
to Ms. Yue?

272
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,760
Whether it's her or not,

273
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
we'll know in a few days.

274
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
By the way,

275
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,721
we've spoken with the cafeteria chef
who's the caretaker.

276
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,520
He has started with the replacement.

277
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,119
The snake replacement
looks similar to the original one,

278
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,520
but her habits are very different.

279
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,719
As time goes by,

280
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
she'll surely be attacked
by your snakes.

281
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,400
She might even get bitten to death.

282
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,119
Once there's a large number
of dead snakes,

283
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,720
those chefs will surely report it.

284
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
The chairman
will surely make a move.

285
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Keep a close eye.

286
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,520
If the other side makes a move,
report it to me immediately.

287
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Don't worry.

288
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,936
After all this time,
it's the day we've been waiting for.

289
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,759
When that day comes,
I can't say we'll surely succeed,

290
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,336
but I'm sure
nothing major will go wrong.

291
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,560
The snake will be rescued.

292
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
Let's go see our snake babies.

293
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,520
It's been a while.

294
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,960
I do miss them.

295
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,400
Come and take a look at this.

296
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Is this the one?

297
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
There's more over there.

298
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Still none of that?

299
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Xiao Shuai.

300
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,920
Come and take a look.
Is this the one?

301
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Take a look.

302
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,880
This is it.
It looks exactly the same.

303
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Yes.

304
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,360
(Recommended)

305
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,519
Let me tell you.

306
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,040
For every snake Chi Cheng has,

307
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,840
Young Master Guo has a copy.

308
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,040
Shut up.

309
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
I...

310
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,640
Can you sell this snake to me?

311
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,680
Are you kidding me?

312
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,200
Would I take your money?

313
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Li Wang.

314
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,920
Put this snake in a glass box...

315
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,480
and deliver it to his clinic.

316
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,440
Aren't you going to ask me...

317
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,800
why I'm buying this snake?

318
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't need to know the reason
for what I'm giving to you.

319
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
As long as you need it.

320
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Thank you.

321
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
That was fast.

322
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,760
Do you doubt my capability?

323
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Did he...

324
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,560
do anything to you?

325
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,920
Who am I?
Can he take advantage of me?

326
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,800
You asked him for one
and he just gave it to you?

327
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,360
Yes. No nonsense from him at all.

328
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,880
It seems like...

329
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,880
Guo Cheng Yu treats you quite well.

330
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,480
Not as good as Chi Cheng treats you.

331
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,640
He treats you much better
than Chi Cheng treats me.

332
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,680
If I ask Chi Cheng for a snake,

333
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,040
he definitely
won't give one to me...

334
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,040
no matter how much I like it.

335
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,880
That's not the same.

336
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,360
Guo Cheng Yu keeps snakes for fun.

337
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,800
But Chi Cheng
treats them like his children.

338
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
You can't just give a child away.

339
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Right.

340
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
The meaning is different.

341
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,040
To Guo Cheng Yu,

342
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,120
a snake is a snake.

343
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,960
But to Chi Cheng,

344
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,320
a snake is a person.

345
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,240
A longing that belongs only to him.

346
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
It's not something anyone can touch.

347
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,680
I smell jealousy.

348
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,600
Why don't we take a look
at the snake first?

349
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Tell me.

350
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,200
Such an expensive snake...

351
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,800
must be worth a lot.

352
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,839
Why don't we put in
a fake one first?

353
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,400
She's going to get killed
by Chi Cheng's snakes anyway.

354
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,120
We can't be penny-wise
and pound-foolish.

355
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,480
If the snake watchers find out,

356
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,600
Chi Cheng will the one
who suffers the loss.

357
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,160
I've already invested
over 100,000 yuan in this project.

358
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,040
This small amount isn't a big deal.

359
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Stingy Wu, just to make a man smile,

360
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
you're willing to spend
so much money?

361
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
I'll treat it as venture capital.

362
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
After all,

363
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,960
a man who can make me spend money...

364
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,560
is surely worth it.

365
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,520
The plan is going so well.

366
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
Why aren't you happy?

367
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
I don't know.

368
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I just feel annoyed.

369
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,559
Seeing that poison packet,
you don't think Chi Cheng...

370
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,800
would indulge Yue Yue
instead of being mad, right?

371
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,200
If he indulges her,

372
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
he's not Chi Cheng.

373
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,200
To Chi Cheng,

374
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,520
snakes are his top priority.

375
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,560
Do you know why you feel frustrated?

376
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,360
Actually, you don't care
about Yue Yue anymore.

377
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,960
What you're conflicted about...

378
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,320
is Chi Cheng's attitude.

379
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,280
For the sake of those snakes,

380
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,960
he'd rather stay with Yue Yue.

381
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,280
That makes you upset.

382
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,879
As long as Chi Cheng says
he's giving up on the snakes,

383
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,280
everything can be resolved.

384
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,200
But he won't.

385
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,959
That's why you can only
do your best...

386
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,720
to get the snakes back...

387
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,320
while watching him be
all lovey-dovey with someone else.

388
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,960
That's why you feel wronged
and upset.

389
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,319
You can't accept
that you're suffering...

390
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,960
because of his beloved snakes.

391
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
Am I right?

392
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,480
Just tell me if I'm right or not.

393
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,040
You're just so freaking smart,
aren't you?

394
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,199
- Let go.
- You're so freaking smart?

395
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,320
You disobedient student!

396
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
As long as you can kill that snake,

397
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,520
I don't care how you do it.

398
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
Can we poison it?

399
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,440
Did I pay you to come here...

400
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,080
to come up with such a stupid plan?

401
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360
He doesn't eat food from outsiders.

402
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Cut the crap.

403
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,280
Just kill it.

404
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,920
I want to see his corpse
with my own eyes.

405
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,240
That's too risky.

406
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,160
We can't do it at this price.

407
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
You'll have to pay more.

408
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I'll double it.

409
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,120
I really want to see you right now.

410
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm not kidding.

411
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,056
The situation has changed.

412
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,976
The caretaker who replaced
the snake is suddenly unreachable.

413
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,576
The cafeteria's chefs
have been replaced too.

414
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,456
They must have found a problem
with your snakes...

415
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,040
and they're thinking
of a way to fix it.

416
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Wait a moment.

417
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,120
Keep a close eye on them.

418
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,040
It's sooner than I thought.

419
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,519
We just replaced over 20 snakes...

420
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,200
and they already noticed
something's wrong.

421
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,560
Okay, I got it.

422
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,440
- Tell me.
- He's not even anxious about it.

423
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
When can we meet?

424
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Mr. Wu.

425
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,520
I can't reach the vendor.

426
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,200
I went to his home
and all his belongings were gone.

427
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,760
I think he's going to flee.

428
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,360
Something must be going on
at the Storage Base.

429
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,320
I want to put more men
to watch the door.

430
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,640
What do you think?

431
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,800
I'll leave it to you.

432
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,119
Don't worry about the money.

433
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,160
I'll surely pay you.

434
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
From here.

435
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
I'll try to lift it.

436
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Hello?

437
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
I want to see you.

438
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,960
Where are you?

439
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,320
I'm on my way to the clinic.

440
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,040
Are you out of your mind?

441
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Hello?

442
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Hello?

443
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,560
Why aren't you saying anything?

444
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm coming to see you too.

445
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,640
I'm already in front of your house.

446
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Done.

447
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,160
Darn it. Green-Eyed Monster
is in danger.

448
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
It's so big.

449
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,000
- Let's move it away.
- Okay.

450
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,079
So Chi Cheng swapped the snake.

451
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,320
If that's the case, it'll be easier
for me to put on a show.

452
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,719
Smash it.

453
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,760
You do it.

454
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
It's not locked.

455
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
What should we do?

456
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:11,241
Should we bring him out
or kill him here?

457
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Let's kill him here.

458
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
You do it.

459
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Can you do anything?

460
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
- I'll do it.
- What are you doing?

461
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Who are you?

462
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
Save it.

463
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,440
Get lost if you want to live.

464
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,240
I'll kill you.

465
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,999
Are you all right?

466
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,039
I'm fine.

467
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,080
I'm okay.

468
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,360
Darn it, the snake is poisonous.

469
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
Who told you to come here?

470
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
You won't talk?

471
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,920
Do you want to use my money
to get yourselves treated...

472
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,200
or her money to buy coffins?

473
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,280
It's your choice.

474
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,800
It's your girlfriend.

475
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,440
She doesn't like you keeping snakes.

476
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,880
She asked us to kill it.

477
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,080
The three of you will all die.

478
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,480
Wake up.

479
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Endure it.

480
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,320
You put that rat poison packet
in there, didn't you?

481
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,040
What rat poison packet?

482
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,440
That rat poison...

483
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,640
won't hurt
Green-Eyed Monster that much.

484
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,440
But over time,

485
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,760
it will take effect.

486
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,040
Whoever tried to poison this way...

487
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,360
either doesn't know
Green-Eyed Monster...

488
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,080
or knows him too well.

489
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,079
I wasn't sure...

490
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,920
how much Yue Yue knew
about Green-Eyed Monster.

491
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,880
But since she chose
to have someone kill the snake,

492
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,320
this is the only answer.

493
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,400
When did you find out?

494
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,040
When you told me
Green-Eyed Monster is in danger.

495
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,600
I knew you didn't poison him.

496
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,280
You did it to remind me
to protect Green-Eyed Monster.

497
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,399
If I was a bit late today,

498
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,960
you're the one
who would have been hurt.

499
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,320
Will you only be satisfied if you
get stabbed and make me feel bad?

500
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,279
Can you keep your tricks...

501
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,640
and stop scheming?

502
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Well...

503
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,160
I did it for Green-Eyed Monster.

504
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,840
I was really scared just now.

505
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,080
I'm fine now.

506
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,320
How dare you smile?

507
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
What's the matter?

508
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,160
Seeing you heartbroken...

509
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,760
makes me so happy.

510
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,120
Fine.

511
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,960
I'll let you see that all you want.

512
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,520
Can you not do
this kind of thing again?

513
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,920
Whatever you do for me...

514
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
has nothing to do
with me liking you or not.

515
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,960
Even if you don't do anything,

516
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,160
I'll still like you.

517
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
What if...

518
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,640
I lied to you...

519
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,360
and tricked you?

520
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
What will you do?

521
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,640
Then I'll like you even more.

522
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Why?

523
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,920
Because you'll owe me.

524
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,200
Then it'll be justified
to sleep with you.

525
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
You...

526
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,640
I've never wanted
to sleep with anyone so much.

527
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,880
The way you express
your affection...

528
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,200
is too straightforward.

529
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,920
We're both freaking men.

530
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,800
Should I say sweet-nothings
to lie to you?

531
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,840
(Bonus Clip)

532
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Let's eat.

533
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,760
Is your taste...

534
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,560
really okay?

535
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,520
Your floral shorts and clothes...

536
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,080
are hard to put into words.

537
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,400
Darn it.

538
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,759
You have no idea how cost-effective
and how comfortable they are.

539
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,000
Besides, making art is expensive.

540
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,759
I won't feel bad only when I spend
the client's money.

541
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,760
The higher my client's budget,
the better my taste.
