00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,680
Dr. Jiang.

4
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,199
- Ms. Mei Li. - I brought you a spring couplet.

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,279
Thank you, Ms. Mei Li.

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,240
- Happy New Year, Ms. Mei Li. - Happy New Year.

7
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,960
Dr. Jiang, why didn't you go home for New Year?

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,856
During the New Year, I'm afraid people can't find a doctor,

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,000
so I stayed behind...

10
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,120
and let Chubby to go home.

11
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,440
Dr. Jiang, you're so kindhearted.

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,840
It's New Year's Eve.

13
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,120
You have to eat dumplings.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
- Do you have them? - Yes.

15
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
Don't worry, Ms. Mei Li.

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay. I'll get going then.

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
- Bye. - Okay.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Bye, Ms. Mei Li.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

23

- Mom, I'm done pasting them. - Okay.

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,360
When did you buy these clothes?

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,800
Look at you. Your memory is worse than mine now.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Didn't you buy this for me last month?

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
Last month?

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then...

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,080
who gave it to you?

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,880
Xiao Chi.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
He did?

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Here.

33
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Try it on.

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
When did you buy it?

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,080
When I was buying clothes for my mom today,

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,880
I bought one for you too.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,240
That day, Xiao Chi even brought the doctor here.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
He said from now on,

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,399
the doctor will come to our house regularly to examine me.

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
So I won't need to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
Xiao Chi...

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,920
really knows how to treat people well.

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Da Qiong.

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Have you visited his parents?

45
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
I...

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm asking you.

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,240
There's no need for me to do that.

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,639
What do you mean?

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,560
Why are you so insensible?

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
He's so nice to us.

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,759
If you don't visit his parents,

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
is that appropriate?

53
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,280
I'll go. I'll definitely go.

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,399
Well, they're very busy now.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
When they're free, I'll definitely go.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,319
You have to. You have to be polite.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Okay.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
This is so rare.

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
- We're all gathered here. - Happy New Year!

60
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,121
- We must eat and drink well. - Happy New Year!

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
Don't be shy. Eat up.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
This is the umami flavor.

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
- Eat more. - Yes.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,120
Here, my nephew.

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,280
Let me toast to you.

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,559
Uncle.

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Here.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,279
You're not young anymore.

69
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,239
- Thank you, Mom. - I wonder when I will get...

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,520
to attend your wedding.

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,440
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,880
Chi Cheng is very popular with the ladies.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
So many girls are after him.

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,760
Of course he must carefully take his pick.

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
Am I right?

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
Yes.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Me and my big mouth.

78
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
Seriously.

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Chi Cheng.

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,279
Your cousin just bought a new house.

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
He's about to renovate it.

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,800
I heard your friend opened an art installation company.

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,840
I'll have to trouble you to help decorate it then.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,296
Discuss the price among yourselves.

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,640
What price?

87
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,359
He invested in the company.

88
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
It's on the house.

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
You're brilliant.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Here.

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
- Here. - Here's to you.

92
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
All right, on behalf of my family,

93
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,840
I wish everyone good health and safety in the new year.

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,096
- Here. Let's drink. - Here.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
I wish you good health...

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
- and beauty! - And beauty!

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,400
Yuan Duan, may your business prosper...

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,960
- and may more money roll in. - And may more money roll in.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
Today,

100
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,520
I can't even chat for a minute with them.

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
Da Qiong, how's it going?

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,799
I'm kneading the noodles.

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
Want to give all my love

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Mrs. Wu.

105
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Happy New Year.

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,280
We were just talking about you and here you are.

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,440
Da Qiong, come on.

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,640
You look so handsome today.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Da Qiong, Xiao Chi is here.

110
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
You guys talk. We'll be eating dumplings soon.

111
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,080
Why are you at my house on New Year's?

112
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Can I stay now?

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Have a seat.

114
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,680
Here are the dumplings.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
Dig in.

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Let's eat.

117
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Here, Xiao Chi.

118
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

119
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,479
It's New Year's Eve, if you don't go home for dinner,

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,200
is your family okay with it?

121
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,320
There are so many of them.

122
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
They don't need me.

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,440
In the future, come eat at our house often.

124
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,319
Da Qiong always praises you.

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,960
He says you're really nice to him.

126
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Okay.

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Come on.

128
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,320
Let's drink.

129
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,279
Mom. don't pour it for him. He has to drive later.

130
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,559
Call a designated driver.

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,200
He rarely comes to our house.

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
And it's New Year.

133
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,840
How can you not drink a bit?

134
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,440
At worst,

135
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,600
stay overnight at our house again.

136
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,399
The bed in Da Qiong's room is really big.

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,640
You two can roll around as much as you want.

138
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

139
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Slow down.

140
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,441
- How can you choke while eating? - Here. Eat this.

141
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,640
We'll roll on the bed later.

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Hold it.

143
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Here.

144
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Throw it.

145
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
That's so exciting.

146
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Here.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You light one.

148
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Me?

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
I don't want to.

150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,800
It's like a landmine.

151
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
It makes this exploding sound.

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,120
The kind of fireworks you play with are for little girls.

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,760
This one is so darn manly.

154
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
You do it.

155
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
I'll light it.

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Here.

157
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
What are you doing?

158
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,480
- No. - Don't move.

159
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,399
Don't! Mr. Chi!

160
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,239
- Throw it. - Don't panic.

161
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,960
One, two, three, go.

162
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,080
This is exciting.

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Who is it?

164
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
Food delivery.

165
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,520
I didn't order any food.

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,039
What do you think? Are you surprised?

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
Is this unexpected?

168
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
Why are you here?

169
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,760
I'm here to deliver warmth to you.

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,760
Otherwise, you'd be lonely by yourself at home.

171
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Right?

172
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm here now.

173
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,119
Are you happy to see me?

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
Hey, fox.

175
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
Come in for the new year.

176
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,560
All right, goose.

177
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,816
Let me show you what I can do.

178
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Come on.

179
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Try it.

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,960
This was all you had today?

181
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,759
You're amazing.

182
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm good, right?

183
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
(Mom)

184
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
Since we started cooking,

185
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
your phone has been ringing.

186
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Why don't you go back to do what you need to do?

187
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
All right.

188
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I'll get going then.

189
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Go.

190
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,736
You don't have to see me out.

191
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I'll get going.

192
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,480
I really won't see you out.

193
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
All right.

194
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,679
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, - Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

195
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,400
- five, four, three, two, one! - Three, two, one.

196
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,840
Surprise!

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,440
What do you think? You were surprised, right?

198
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,560
Actually, I didn't leave at all.

199
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,040
You're an adult.

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,560
Why do you still do these things?

201
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,200
Isn't this trick...

202
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,520
used to pacify children?

203
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Come on.

204
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Hurry up.

205
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:22,160
Make a wish.

206
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Come on.

207
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I hope...

208
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,640
everything will go smoothly for us.

209
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Us?

210
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Can't you see the meaning?

211
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Then tell me.

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
What's the meaning?

213
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,040
Of course it's for things to go well.

214
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
For things...

215
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,040
to go well.

216
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
Eat more then.

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,320
You ambushed me.

218
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Eat more.

219
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,040
You...

220
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,760
(Darn it, Xiao Shuai. Take a look! It's his karma.)

222
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Yes!

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,240
The exposé at school before...

224
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,960
is all true.

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,640
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,640
For years, I've been dating many male students...

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,920
using my identity as a teacher.

228
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,280
Under the pretext of discussing projects,

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
I lured them to the office.

230
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,000
I manipulated them.

231
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,440
I emotionally abused them.

232
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,119
When I got bored, I drugged them...

233
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,840
and framed them for promiscuity.

234
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,640
After dumping them, I moved on to the next one.

235
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm a jerk.

236
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm trash.

237
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
I, Meng Tao, am not human.

238
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,439
I deserve to go to hell!

239
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,799
I deserve to go to hell.

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,000
I deserve to go to hell.

241
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,640
I deserve to go to hell.

242
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
I deserve to go to hell.

243
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,480
I deserve to go to hell.

244
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,400
- I deserve it. - Come on, Xiao Shuai.

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Let's go eat.

246
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,560
I deserve to go to hell.

247
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,880
I was wrong.

248
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,600
Darn it. Wasn't he...

249
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm a jerk.

250
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,399
It was him.

251
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
It was him.

252
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,280
It was him.

253
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,320
He was my scumbag ex-boyfriend.

254
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,600
You can go now.

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Come to me if you have any questions.

256
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Go on.

257
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:12,159
- Bye, Mr. Meng. - Bye, Mr. Meng.

258
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Let's go.

259
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
- Xiao Shuai. - Xiao Shuai.

260
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Bye.

261
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,079
How many times have I told you?

262
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm undergoing a promotion assessment lately.

263
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,640
We have to be careful in school.

264
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,960
Why can't you remember?

265
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,840
I don't see people here.

266
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,280
So...

267
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

268
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,800
I remember when I first met you,

269
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,400
you weren't this careless and you didn't talk back to me.

270
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,920
What happened to you?

271
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Meng Tao.

272
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
Meng Tao, I didn't do it on purpose.

273
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

275
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,040
Listen, this week is very crucial for me.

276
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
Let's not see each other for now, all right?

277
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Meng Tao.

278
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry, Meng Tao. I...

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Xiao Shuai, what's wrong?

280
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,759
You're looking for Jiang Xiao Shuai?

281
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,119
Jiang Xiao Shuai, right?

282
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Yes.

283
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Stop drinking.

284
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,280
No. We're out to have fun, so we must drink.

285
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,280
Yes. One more sip.

286
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,480
- Drink mine. - No.

287
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,839
That's right.

288
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,919
I can't drink anymore.

289
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
A two-pronged attack.

290
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Are you drunk?

291
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Tell me.

292
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
How do you explain this?

293
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,480
I really don't remember anymore.

294
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
After we had a fight that day,

295
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,496
I was in a bad mood, so I went drinking with my friends.

296
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,920
A few more friends came. I was already drunk at that time.

297
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Liar.

298
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Keep making it up.

299
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,040
Meng Tao, we've been together for so long.

300
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,320
Please believe me. I didn't betray you.

301
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Don't touch me.

302
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,320
You're so dirty. Do you know that?

303
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

304
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,400
Get out of my life.

305
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,320
I really felt so dirty back then...

306
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,560
and that I wasn't good enough for him.

307
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
That's him.

308
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,096
Jiang Xiao Shuai joined that disgusting thing.

309
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,439
There are photos of it too.

310
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,400
Him? He looks decent. His personal life is such a mess.

311
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
Most importantly, they're all men.

312
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,040
- Darn it. - Look at this photo.

313
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,720
It was like I grew thorns.

314
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,239
Back then, I felt like everyone passing me by...

315
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,040
was pointing fingers at me.

316
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,759
- How exciting. - Don't show it to me.

317
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
Later on, he also married another woman.

318
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,920
I clearly remember...

319
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,160
putting my phone on silent mode.

320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
But for some reason,

321
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,280
the phone still rang.

322
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,600
I didn't know how the phone could ring for so long.

323
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,640
It rang for so long as if I had to pick up the phone.

324
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,520
(Lin Lin's mom)

325
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,759
Hello, Dr. Jiang?

326
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,239
Dr. Jiang, Lin Lin fainted again.

327
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,440
What should I do?

328
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,599
Your house is right next door.

329
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,480
Can you please come and check now?

330
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,240
Thanks to your emergency treatment last time,

331
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,736
when Lin Lin was sent to the hospital,

332
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,680
she was saved from the brink of death.

333
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,160
If anything happens to Lin Lin, what will happen to me?

334
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,440
Dr. Jiang, please.

335
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,920
Back then, I just hated him.

336
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,160
I hated him for spreading my photos.

337
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,440
I hated him for making me want to die.

338
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,560
But I didn't know...

339
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,400
he was such a ruthless scumbag.

340
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,040
Xiao Shuai.

341
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Why didn't you tell me something so important?

342
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,360
If you did, I would have confronted him.

343
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,721
A scumbag like him deserves to die a thousand times over.

344
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,560
I'm sorry. We're closed for the day.

345
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
It's okay, Xiao Shuai.

346
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,559
The heavens is fair.

347
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,600
He's getting what he deserves now.

348
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
Meng Tao!

349
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,680
How dare you come here?

350
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Xiao Shuai.

351
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
I was wrong.

353
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Xiao Shuai.

354
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Xiao Shuai.

355
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:20,799
I was wrong back then.

356
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,480
- Let go of me. - Xiao Shuai, I was wrong.

357
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,040
- Let go of me! - I was wrong.

358
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,680
I deserve to die. I'm sorry, Xiao Shuai.

359
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,680
I shouldn't have dumped you just to marry my boss' daughter.

360
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,399
I shouldn't have resorted to such despicable means...

361
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,040
just to dump you, all the more.

362
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
I was wrong.

363
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,720
I admit it.

364
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,080
I was the one...

365
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
who planned everything.

366
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,000
Those men...

367
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,200
I hired those men.

368
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,559
Actually, you never slept with them.

369
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Xiao Shuai.

370
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,879
I knew it.

371
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
You piece of trash!

372
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Xiao Shuai.

373
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Xiao Shuai.

374
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,199
Didn't you want to know the truth?

375
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,000
This is the whole truth. I've told you everything.

376
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,440
I recorded the video too.

377
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I've also apologized.

378
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,880
I swear. I promise.

379
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,359
I won't do it again.

380
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,359
I swear I won't do it again.

381
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,880
Xiao Shuai, can...

382
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,040
Xiao Shuai, can you ask your friend to spare me?

383
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,879
Okay? Talk to him for me.

384
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,120
Spare me. Okay?

385
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,720
Spare my worthless life.

386
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Xiao Shuai.

387
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm a jerk! I'm not human.

388
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm a jerk!

389
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Xiao Shuai.

390
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,960
Ask your friend to spare me.

391
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,720
What are you talking about?

392
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,880
What friend? Don't touch me!

393
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,600
It's your friend with the surname Guo.

394
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
He said only if you forgive me,

395
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,280
then will he spare me.

396
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
My worthless life is not worth mentioning.

397
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,400
Xiao Shuai, how about this?

398
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,319
For the sake...

399
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
of our past relationship,

400
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,240
can you ask him to spare me?

401
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,479
Ask him to let me off. Xiao Shuai, please.

402
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,040
- Darn it. - Please spare me.

403
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,600
Meng Tao.

404
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,840
Are you even human?

405
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,080
You're just a piece of trash!

406
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,760
When you slandered me before, didn't you think today will come?

407
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,519
When you hurt others before,

408
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,440
didn't you think this will happen today?

409
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,520
We all have to pay for what we did.

410
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,399
You can apologize,

411
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,480
but I have a reason not to accept it.

412
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,840
Yes, you're right.

413
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,400
Dr. Xiao Shuai, it's my fault.

414
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,919
I'm not human. I'm trash.

415
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,999
I'm not human. I'm trash.

416
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
- Spare me. - Scram.

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Get lost!

418
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Darn it, he said get lost. Didn't you hear it?

419
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,479
- Leave. - Xiao Shuai, I'm sorry.

420
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,760
Young Master Guo, I already apologized. Spare me.

421
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,960
Let me off. I already apologized.

422
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,576
You said you were going on a business trip.

423
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,920
This was what you were busy with?

424
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Thank you.

425
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
It's nothing.

426
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
What did you say?

427
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
"Thank you"?

428
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,960
You can say something nice?

429
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,280
Then say it again for me. Say it again.

430
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Do you want...

431
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,080
to kill me with that punch?

432
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,800
Luckily, I work out.

433
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Goodness.

434
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
When...

435
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,800
When did you find out?

436
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
Well,

437
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,200
I think...

438
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,680
since the day I followed you.

439
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,159
Can you stop pretending to be innocent?

440
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,680
It doesn't suit you.

441
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,680
At first, I thought you were quite interesting.

442
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,520
I always wanted to come and tease you.

443
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
"Jiang..."

444
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
"Xiao..."

445
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
"Shuai."

446
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,160
I'll remember you.

447
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,040
- Okay. - All right.

448
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
- Ma'am, just take this. - Dr. Xiao Shuai.

449
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,280
Help me check why there's no sound on this phone.

450
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,639
Click here. Here.

451
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
Thank you, Dr. Xiao Shuai.

452
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Later on,

453
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,760
I found out that you're a warm and kind person.

454
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,759
Li Wang.

455
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
Look into someone for me.

456
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
His name is Meng Tao.

457
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,296
Jiang Xiao Shuai almost committed suicide because of this.

458
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,960
Then he left his hometown and moved here.

459
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,440
When I found out that you were hurt so badly,

460
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,120
yet you can still embrace the world warmly,

461
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
I've decided...

462
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
to help you get rid of your sensitive...

463
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
and inferior self.

464
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,000
It's not my fault.

465
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,280
Apologize.

466
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,800
Make him apologize to me.

467
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,320
Make him apologize to me.

468
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Go to sleep.

469
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Don't worry.

470
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,360
I'll make sure...

471
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,120
he pays back...

472
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,720
what he owes you piece by piece.

473
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,760
Do you admit it? Were you wrong or not?

474
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,479
I was wrong.

475
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
That's enough.

476
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,360
Don't kill him yet.

477
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Drag him here.

478
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Get up!

479
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,720
Do you know why we're beating you up?

480
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Speak up!

481
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,400
I know.

482
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
This has dragged on for so long.

483
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
It's time to put closure to this.

484
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Mr. Guo.

485
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Mr. Guo.

486
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,959
Mr. Guo, I know I was wrong.

487
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,760
Please let me go. I'll be a good person from now on.

488
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,919
I won't do it again.

489
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,479
I've gotten my karma.

490
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
I'm begging you.

491
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Karma?

492
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,000
After this video is recorded,

493
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
remember to find Jiang Xiao Shuai.

494
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,800
Tell him everything you did back then.

495
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,559
Yes.

496
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,600
Record it!

497
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
You have no right to make demands.

498
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,360
Do as I say.

499
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
Otherwise,

500
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,080
I'll be the one to take your life.

501
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Go ahead.

502
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,160
Raise your head.

503
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
The exposé at school before...

504
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,720
is all true.

505
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

506
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,440
For years, I've been dating many male students...

507
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,680
using my identity as a teacher.

508
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,239
If this gets out, he's done for.

509
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,000
Under the pretext of discussing projects,

510
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,360
I lured them to the office.

511
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Make a wish.

512
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,600
I wish...

513
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,560
everything will go smoothly for us.

514
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,040
I'll make sure you get what you want.

515
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
It's tiring to scold people, right?

516
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:28,720
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

517
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,479
For the Cantonese cuisine you mentioned, let me tell you,

518
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,000
most Cantonese restaurants...

519
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
focus on their dim sum.

520
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
But for this place,

521
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,280
their stir-fried dishes are the best.

522
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,600
- Stir-fried dishes. - You can taste the wok's flavor.

523
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,080
Especially...

524
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
their signature boneless carp.

525
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
It's superb.

526
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,760
It melts in your mouth.

527
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
It's so fresh...

528
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
that you'd wish to swallow...

529
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,840
your tongue too.

530
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Let's go, Xiao Shuai.

531
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
I'll take you there.

532
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
- Xiao Shuai. - What's wrong?

533
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Wait for me.

534
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Wang Shuo.

535
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Cheng Yu.

536
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
You actually came back.

537
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,240
You actually recognized me in one glance.

538
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,760
You're good.

539
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,720
All these years,

540
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,440
you've always put on airs.

541
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,680
You walk as if you don't have legs.

542
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,280
After having too many snakes,

543
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,600
I can naturally...

544
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,680
tell you apart from normal people.

545
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Cheng Yu.

546
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,880
Who is he?

547
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Hello.

548
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm Wang Shuo.

549
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,560
Wang Shuo?

550
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
Jiang Xiao Shuai is good.

551
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,960
He knows I want to talk to you,

552
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
so he left early.

553
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
I like him.

554
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:30,719
(There are snakes in the garden, don't enter unless invited)

555
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,840
He's mine. I don't need you to like him.

556
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
He's yours?

557
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,520
You're so protective of him.

558
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,280
Back then,

559
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,200
I was half yours too, right?

560
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,160
I've never seen you so protective of me.

561
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,600
I realized that after so many years,

562
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,600
your wickedness hasn't changed at all.

563
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,519
In the blink of an eye,

564
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,760
I've been back for half a year.

565
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,920
You've hidden for quite some time.

566
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
What do you mean?

567
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,480
I have a home here too. Can't I come back?

568
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,040
Someone untied the horse you've tethered...

569
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
for six years.

570
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,320
If you hadn't come back soon,

571
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,400
someone will take it away.

572
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,200
By then, it'll be too late even if you want to chase it.

573
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
If I chased after it a few months ago,

574
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
it would've been a matter of just taking the rope.

575
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,880
If I chase after it now,

576
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,720
even if I take the rope,

577
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,960
the horse might not necessarily follow me.

578
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
Don't you...

579
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,760
like adventurous games?

580
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm leaving in a couple of days.

581
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,480
Aren't you planning to see Chi Cheng?

582
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,240
It doesn't matter if I meet him or not.

583
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
You won't leave.

584
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
How do you know?

585
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
I just do.

586
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Guo Cheng Yu.

587
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,720
You're too smart...

588
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,960
to be likable.

589
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,880
(Cheng Yu Snake Garden)

590
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,280
(Guo Cheng Yu: Sunny day)

591
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
It's nothing.

592
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,880
(Guo Cheng Yu: Did you see the photo?)

593
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,639
(What's going on?)

594
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,960
I bumped into him on the street.

595
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,400
He came to see you.

596
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,519
(Didn't he come to see you?)

597
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,760
He said...

598
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,520
he wants to meet up with you.

599
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
(Jiang Xiao Shuai)

600
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,920
Why did he come back?

601
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,760
He's probably here to snatch him away.

602
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,920
You have to keep an eye on Chi Cheng.

603
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,280
The lethality of the return of one's first love...

604
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,400
is not something ordinary people can handle.

605
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Do you want some water?

606
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
You...

607
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
saw it?

608
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,720
See what?

609
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,600
If you want to go after him,

610
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,760
hurry up and do it.

611
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,440
Otherwise, you'll lose your chance.

612
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,880
No, tell me.

613
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,280
Go after whom?

614
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,600
I remember someone...

615
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,720
said this on someone's birthday.

616
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,960
"Don't let me see him again."

617
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,880
"If I see him again, I'll kill him."

618
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Are you jealous?

619
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,160
How is that possible?

620
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,560
Yes.

621
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,800
Before, I thought killing him would make me feel better.

622
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,520
But then I met you.

623
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,280
Why waste my time on that?

624
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,799
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

625
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
If you're so capable, get rid of him now.

626
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,760
Wait. Do you like torturing yourself that much?

627
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,080
Must I explode from anger like what you expected to satisfy you?

628
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,080
Yes. I like seeing you explode from anger.

629
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
I'm sorry to disappoint you then.

630
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Don't worry.

631
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,000
There's no crack in my heart anymore.

632
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Cheers!

633
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,720
Do you have a fish in your mouth? Drink it.

634
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,360
This place hasn't changed at all.

635
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
But you've lost weight.

636
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,320
What does it have to do with you?

637
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Have you lost weight?

638
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,120
You didn't. You're quite muscular, aren't you?

639
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
But you...

640
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,000
are super darn skinny.

641
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,360
With your figure now,

642
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,199
it's like being with a woman.

643
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,400
Women won't like you.

644
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,760
If a man's with you,

645
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,040
there's nothing much of you to play with.

646
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,640
You have a freaking foul mouth.

647
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,160
I'm skinny, but shapely.

648
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,920
I just have low body fat.

649
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,440
Didn't you enjoy being with me back then?

650
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,280
I almost forgot if you didn't tell me.

651
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,840
It was quite enjoyable indeed.

652
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
However,

653
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
it was only that one time.

654
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Unlike Chi Cheng.

655
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,280
He was with you...

656
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
for three years.

657
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,240
You have such a stinky mouth.

658
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,680
Didn't your brother come back with you?

659
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
He did.

660
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,400
He's busy with his own stuff.

661
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,080
Speaking of your brother,

662
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
I remember when we were in college.

663
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,159
Whenever you were bullied at school,

664
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,720
your brother would rush over...

665
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,240
and beat you up.

666
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,400
The bullies were so scared...

667
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,920
that they begged your brother to stop.

668
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But that's good.

669
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,640
No one bullied you anymore.

670
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,056
Do you know what this is called?

671
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
What is it called?

672
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:12,361
It's called psychological abuse.

673
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,320
Those who bullied me...

674
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,400
saw that my own brother even did that to me.

675
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,960
Who would dare to bully me?

676
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,160
So they stayed away from me.

677
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,040
Your brother is a genius.

678
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,240
I heard...

679
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,080
that the people you both are pairing up with now...

680
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,320
are a teacher and apprentice.

681
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
Yes.

682
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,160
Why do you two always do that?

683
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
You used to chase twins together.

684
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,640
You couldn't even tell who is who.

685
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,296
Now, you're messing with a teacher and apprentice.

686
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
What?

687
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,640
Do you want to show off...

688
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,040
how close you are?

689
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,160
We've always been...

690
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,840
this close.

691
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
We are.

692
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,160
But stop smoking my freaking cigarettes.

693
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
If you guys can't handle your liquor, don't drink.

694
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
I'll get going.

695
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Go.

696
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
I'll get going.

697
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Bye.
