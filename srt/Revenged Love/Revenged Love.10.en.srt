00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 10, Can You Turn
Straight Again After Being Bent?)

3
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,160
That makes sense.

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
He must have found someone new.

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
That's good too.

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,959
From now on,

7
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,200
I'll have more peace and quiet.

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Sir!

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Da Wei.

10
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,319
- Sir.
- You're discharged already?

11
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,359
You've recovered so quickly.

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,440
If I didn't get discharged,

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,039
I'll be poisoned to death
by those nutritional meals.

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,600
Do they taste that bad?

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Take a look.

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Isn't it cool?

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,320
It is.

18
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,360
But it's not cheap.

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Where did you get the money?

20
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,560
I bought a used car.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,160
It only cost 50,000 yuan.

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,120
That's cheap.

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,240
Buy one for me too.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,280
What I said...

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,000
was really unnecessary.

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,119
Come on, get in.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
- I'll take you for a ride.
- Sure.

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,480
You're good.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,736
You succeeded in taking revenge.

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,160
You're on top of the world.

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
After planning for so long,

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,960
I've finally shattered Yue Yue's
dream of living a luxurious life.

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,120
How could I not be happy?

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,999
However, are you really going
to start a company with Chi Cheng?

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,759
Of course. I sold my snakes.

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,520
I'll just treat it
as starting capital.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,976
The business license
has been approved.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The office renovation
is almost done too.

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
I've hired all the staff.

40
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
Although you were hospitalized,
nothing was delayed.

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,520
Chi Cheng took care of all this.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
I just gave some suggestions.

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,120
The Baiting Plan
I made for you back then...

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,600
was to get him to pursue you.

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
I didn't expect him...

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,680
to go to this extent for you.

47
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,440
That was back then.

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,200
It's different now.

49
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,679
Anyway, he and Yue Yue
already broke up.

50
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,400
We've achieved our goal.

51
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,359
Chi Cheng and I...

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
will only be business partners...

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,080
from now on.

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
We won't be in a relationship.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,520
Look at the rude things
you're saying.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm a straight man.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to date
and marry a woman in the future.

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
Why would I be with a guy like him?

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,720
Ask yourself.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
Do you have feelings for him or not?

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Fine. I admit.

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
I do have feelings for him.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
But I can't be with him.

64
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Why not?

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,040
Why can't two people
who like each other be together?

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,999
If I really get together with him,

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,759
I'll surely be the bottom.

68
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
I can't take it!

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Great!

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,440
Congratulations.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Mr. Wu.

72
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,879
From now on,
you can let us design...

73
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,360
all kinds of lighting fixtures.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Here, let me introduce you.

75
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,079
This is our director.

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,159
- Hello, Mr. Wu.
- Hi.

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,880
- Let's work together in the future.
- Okay.

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,480
The space up there possibly
need more changes.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,960
- Mr. Wu.
- One more.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're welcome.

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,600
It's such a big company.

82
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
Mr. Wu, it's been hard on you.

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
It's fine.

84
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,320
Here, Mr. Wu.

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Let me introduce you.

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,920
- This loser has changed.
- This is my friend, Ms. Yu.

87
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,360
- Hi.
- We can work together.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,879
Mr. Wu is young and promising.

89
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,440
He's reliable, right?

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's go up and take a look.

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

93
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Okay.

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,480
Hi.

95
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,519
You said you wanted
to start a business.

96
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,440
I didn't expect
that you'd really open a company.

97
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
I hope it's a good start.

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,480
You look good in a suit.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,320
Thank you.

100
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
Why is your collar crooked?

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
It's okay.

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,600
I can fix it myself.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
About the project
I mentioned last time,

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,760
if you're interested,
I think we can talk about it again.

105
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
You've changed a lot.

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Not really.

107
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
I left you back then
not because I was snobbish.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I know.

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
He doesn't love me anymore.

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,920
I already broke up with him.

111
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I know.

112
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
So you know all of that.

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,560
You care about me so much.

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
It's because...

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,320
he's already with me.

116
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
What did you say?

117
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,480
We've partnered up...

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,920
to open this company together.

119
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,599
How is that possible?

120
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
How is it possible
for you two to be together?

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,640
Also, I'm the one...

122
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,600
who paid for the designer items
you have now.

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,320
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,560
Have fun.

125
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,160
You really look professional.

126
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,240
Why are they...

127
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,280
You don't have to help me.
It's not like I don't have hands.

128
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Can't I serve you?

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,000
(Invitation from: Wu Suo Wei)

130
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,480
Why is she here?

131
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,960
I should ask you that.

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
I didn't invite her.

133
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
- Mr. Wu.
- Mr. Chi.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Here.

135
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,800
Mr. Chi, I'll go over there first.

136
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,296
Why are you drinking so much?

137
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
What's the matter?

138
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,880
What's wrong with drinking?

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
I can't bear to leave you.

140
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
What do you mean?

141
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,000
We're not going to part ways.

142
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,480
But there's no reason for us
to be together anymore.

143
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,360
I don't believe in love.

144
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,720
Do you?

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
I've been heartbroken.
I don't believe in love.

146
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't believe it.

147
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,080
You're really drunk.

148
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
What are you doing?

149
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Put me down.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm going to throw up.

151
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Stand up.

152
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,040
I need to make a call. Wait for me.

153
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Hey.

154
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,559
Don't go.

155
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
I can't bear to leave you.

156
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
I can't bear it.

157
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm not leaving.

158
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Let go.

159
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,640
Stand still.

160
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
I'll stay with you for the night.

161
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Okay.

162
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,800
I'll always be with you.

163
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I'll always stay with you.

164
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:33,880
Then I'll sing for you.

165
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,679
Sure.

166
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Go ahead.

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,080
Silly guy.

168
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,360
Why drink so much
if you can't hold your liquor?

169
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,280
Silly guy.

170
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Go to sleep.

171
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,080
You two, make sure to place
the candles properly.

172
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,400
- Yes, Mr. Wu.
- Xiao Li.

173
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,199
Have you finished the proposal
I asked you to do last time?

174
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,239
It's done. Here you go.

175
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,480
Good. All right.

176
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,520
You're still texting your boyfriend?

177
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,520
Can't you do that after work?

178
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Get to work.

179
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,439
Is the show good?

180
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Yes.

181
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,799
Move the stuff from the warehouse.

182
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,840
- Okay, Mr. Wu.
- You're an adult. Stop watching it.

183
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,520
The spray paint's color...

184
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
must be rich.

185
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,919
- Okay, Mr. Wu.
- Keep it up.

186
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,959
You're busy. You're all busy.

187
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Xiao Shuai.

188
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
You're still here?

189
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,719
Besides work,

190
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,800
you have to deal
with your personal feelings.

191
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
As you can see,

192
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,041
there's so much going on
at the company.

193
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,680
I don't have time
to think about that.

194
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,696
Chi Cheng has been on a
business trip in the past few days.

195
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,640
He sent me a few messages,
but all about work.

196
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,400
He hasn't made his stance clear.

197
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,800
Why should I think about it?

198
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,000
Can't you take the initiative?

199
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
Why are you so anxious about it?

200
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,280
Worry about your own problems.

201
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,200
What problem do I have?

202
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,640
Just patients at the clinic...

203
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,440
and the neighbors' trivial matters.

204
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
What about your relationship?

205
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,639
I want to be single.

206
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,120
It's good to be alone and carefree.

207
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
Hasn't Guo Cheng Yu...

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,280
been harassing you lately?

209
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,680
He's gone missing.

210
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
That doesn't make sense.

211
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,840
Now that Chi Cheng
and Yue Yue have broken up,

212
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,880
and Chi Cheng and I are so close,

213
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,400
shouldn't Guo Cheng Yu be
more confident in pursuing you?

214
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
Why isn't he doing anything?

215
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,079
He's from a rich family.

216
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
He's surrounded by people.

217
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I am...

218
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,160
just someone who amuses him.

219
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Xiao Shuai.

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let me ask you something.

221
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Go ahead.

222
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,840
Straight men can like men, right?

223
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,880
Then can they turn straight again
after liking men?

224
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,720
I'm afraid not.

225
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Why?

226
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Look.

227
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
If you straighten it again,

228
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,920
it'll break.

229
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
- Mr. Chi.
- Mr. Chi.

230
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

231
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Xiao Shuai.

232
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:25,159
If a man likes another man, he can
still go back to being straight.

233
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,279
It's a disease...

234
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
medically called...

235
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,880
"tunica albuginea abnormality
of the erectile tissue."

236
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
It can be corrected through surgery.

237
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,920
Really, it can.

238
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,960
Who are you chatting with?

239
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,280
- Darn it.
- You're so passionate about it.

240
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
What are you doing?

241
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,520
Sir, I think men can be flexible.

242
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,559
What if the testosterone level
can be adjusted?

243
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,240
I found out that if I'm that way,
I can be straight again.

244
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
Jiang Xiao Shuai is your teacher?

245
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,320
It's just a joke between us.

246
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
The teacher who taught you
how to like men?

247
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
Look at the time.

248
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,440
Let's pack up and go home.

249
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,280
Do you think I'm blind?

250
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,040
Dr. Jiang likes men.

251
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Why are you talking to him about it?

252
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,000
Are you looking for trouble?

253
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
No.

254
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
What are you doing?

255
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
What do you want?

256
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Tell me.

257
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,880
How many times have you chatted?

258
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,816
It's none of your business.

259
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,199
I talk to him every day and night.

260
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
We talk so much
that I can't even count it.

261
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
What are you doing?

262
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,639
I'm warning you.
You've done it so many times.

263
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,959
I don't even want to criticize you.

264
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,479
I just trashed talk a bit.
You have no right to criticize me.

265
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,039
I did those things
before I liked you.

266
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,519
You... Let go.

267
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
No.

268
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,960
What are you doing?

269
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,320
We're at the office.

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Don't mess around.

271
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
I know.

272
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,820
It hurts!

273
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,100
You keep being platonic with me.

274
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,099
If you do it again, I'll kill you.

275
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,259
Get lost. Don't come near me.

276
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,300
- Get lost!
- Don't run.

277
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,620
Why hasn't he replied
to my messages?

278
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,260
Fine. I won't touch you, okay?

279
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,260
Let's break up.

280
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
You really don't want me
to sleep with you, do you?

281
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
It's not that.

282
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Then what is it?

283
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,460
Actually, I lied to you.

284
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,780
What did you lie about?

285
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
Actually,

286
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,540
I'm not who you think I am.

287
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,340
Then what are you like?

288
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,620
Actually,

289
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,980
every second I'm with you,

290
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,339
I'm not myself.

291
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,636
I don't like to read those books
about economics and politics.

292
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,300
I also don't want
to dress up so nicely,

293
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,859
act so gentlemanly,

294
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,219
or sound so articulate.

295
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,260
Well...

296
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,020
Do you think that's how I see you?

297
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,420
To me,

298
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,500
you're just a little loser.

299
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,620
I love it when you run around
in your floral shorts,

300
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,140
blowing sugar figures
like a silly guy,

301
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,260
catching sparrows like a fool,

302
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,980
picking at your feet
and reading comic books.

303
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,700
You're just my little loser.

304
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,820
I'm mesmerized by your loser aura.

305
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,420
Is there anything else
you want to say?

306
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
No.

307
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,060
I'll take you back to the clinic.

308
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Okay.

309
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:33,971
All right.

310
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:35,491
I'm going to take a shower.

311
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:37,771
Go ahead.

312
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:47,851
It's so late.

313
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:49,051
Why isn't he back yet?

314
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,211
Why isn't he replying?

315
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:06,851
Well...

316
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:15,370
Stay away from me.

317
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,531
- You...
- Da Wei.

318
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,851
- Let go of me.
- Goodness!

319
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:20,971
Don't touch me!

320
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,451
- Da Wei.
- Let go of me!

321
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:24,051
What's the matter?

322
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:29,251
Sir.

323
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:33,851
Can we help you?

324
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:36,811
I'm...

325
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,491
sorry to disturb you.

326
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:45,878
The weather is so nice today.

327
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,118
I'll water the plants.

328
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:56,278
The weeds...

329
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:57,718
must be cleared.

330
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:06,758
It's so fun...

331
00:23:06,878 --> 00:23:09,358
to spray this water.

332
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,638
Sir.

333
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:14,678
Stop teasing me.

334
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:17,198
Tell me.

335
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:19,318
Can't you two pick a better place?

336
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:20,998
Must you let me
catch you red-handed?

337
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,398
No wonder you didn't finish...

338
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,238
your audio message yesterday.

339
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,678
You didn't answer my calls either.

340
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:32,598
It turns out that you were busy.

341
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:35,518
Sir, I'm too ashamed to face you.

342
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:37,878
It's okay.

343
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:38,878
It's not that bad.

344
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:40,478
You've finally come to your senses.

345
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:42,837
You're willing to devote yourself...

346
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,198
to be with Chi Cheng.

347
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:47,398
That's a good thing.
I'm happy for you too.

348
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:50,598
Actually,

349
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:52,358
the two of us...

350
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:54,518
never went all the way.

351
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,518
You didn't?

352
00:23:58,918 --> 00:23:59,918
Why?

353
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:04,238
Don't tell me...

354
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:05,798
you still can't accept it?

355
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:08,558
I gave it a try.

356
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,118
But it's really...

357
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:18,078
What if I buy you
a bottle of essence?

358
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,038
Essence?

359
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,398
Keep it down.

360
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:25,318
They can hear you
at the restaurant next door.

361
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:29,998
What do you think?

362
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:33,478
Sir.

363
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,038
I've been straight
for over 20 years.

364
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,838
I need some time
to mentally prepare myself.

365
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:42,838
If you want to stall for time,

366
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,838
why don't you take this chance...

367
00:24:46,238 --> 00:24:48,598
to tell Chi Cheng
why you approached him...

368
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:50,078
in the first place...

369
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:52,158
once and for all?

370
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:56,358
I want to do that too.

371
00:24:57,238 --> 00:24:58,758
But under the circumstances,

372
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:00,478
whenever I see Chi Cheng,

373
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:02,038
I shudder.

374
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:04,478
Sir.

375
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:05,958
Why don't you lend me
some courage...

376
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:07,638
to get rid of this mental struggle?

377
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:11,998
It's not that
I don't want to help you.

378
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,957
I don't have...

379
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,918
the courage
to face Chi Cheng either.

380
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,318
I'm doomed.

381
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:26,798
But sir,

382
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:29,158
does the essence
you mentioned just now...

383
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:30,278
really work?

384
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:32,478
I'll buy a bottle for you to try.

385
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:39,558
Mom.

386
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:43,158
Mom, I'm home.

387
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,558
Where did you get that car?

388
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:50,437
Business has been good lately.

389
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:53,158
I had some extra money,
so I bought a used car.

390
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:56,838
Now that I have a car,
I can visit you often.

391
00:25:57,118 --> 00:25:58,454
I can even take you out for a drive.

392
00:25:58,478 --> 00:25:59,478
Mom.

393
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,877
I bought something for you
in the car.

394
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:02,078
I'll get it out for you later.

395
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:04,877
You're so cocky
after making some money.

396
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:06,397
You must be frugal.

397
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,838
Mom, we must save what we should
and spend what we must.

398
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:10,718
Mom.

399
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:12,038
The loquats are ripe?

400
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,638
Yes. Look.

401
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:15,877
You can take some home.

402
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:16,958
Okay, Mom.

403
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:18,358
Mom.

404
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:20,478
I'll take all of these then.

405
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:22,718
You're taking all of them?

406
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:24,317
What's wrong?

407
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,798
Who are you saving it for?

408
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,798
You have high blood lipids.

409
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,398
You can't eat
these high-sugar fruits.

410
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,758
That's right.

411
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,238
I have to bring some to Chi Cheng.

412
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:36,278
You want to bring some to Chi Cheng?

413
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:38,238
You should've said so earlier.

414
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:42,718
I especially saved a box for him.

415
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:44,278
Mom.

416
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:46,158
Why are you so biased?

417
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:49,317
I took two bags and you
were reluctant to give them to me.

418
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:51,398
But you left a box for Chi Cheng.

419
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:53,278
Why are you so immature?

420
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,557
Every time Chi Cheng comes
to our house,

421
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,798
he brings so many things.

422
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:59,237
We only have corn...

423
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:00,838
and loquat to give to him.

424
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:02,158
What's wrong with giving more?

425
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:07,398
Why do you think Chi Cheng
is so nice to us?

426
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:10,038
Mom.

427
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,958
He's nice to everyone.

428
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:53,278
When...

429
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:54,478
When did you get here?

430
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:56,278
Take a guess.

431
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,478
I didn't do it on purpose that day.

432
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,158
I didn't barge in on purpose.

433
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:04,718
I just heard a noise
from the bathroom.

434
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,478
That's why I...

435
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:09,598
You usually...

436
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:12,558
help Wu Suo Wei
plot against me, right?

437
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:19,278
No.

438
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:20,358
I didn't help him.

439
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,397
I didn't plot against you either.

440
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,598
Wu Suo Wei and I
are not smart enough...

441
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:26,878
to plot against you.

442
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:43,318
I've read your chat log.

443
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:53,238
You've been plotting
against me for so long.

444
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:55,358
I'm sure you already know...

445
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:56,878
about Guo Cheng Yu and me.

446
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:02,478
I will get...

447
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:07,158
whoever he likes.

448
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,358
I'll give you five days.

449
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:18,838
Think of a way to relieve
his mental struggle...

450
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:21,918
and make him willing to be with me.

451
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:28,518
If you can't do it,

452
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:31,638
I'll go back to my old ways.

453
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:37,358
I can't bear to force myself on him.

454
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:39,918
But with you,

455
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:43,598
I'm not so sure.

456
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:46,558
Dr. Jiang.

457
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:48,838
Don't be so nervous.

458
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:53,718
I trust you.

459
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:09,318
If I...

460
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:14,198
can't mess with him,

461
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:15,958
can't I hide from him?

462
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,878
After taking this medicine,
you can't drink alcohol anymore.

463
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,277
Got it.
Dr. Jiang always tells me that.

464
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,317
Thank you, Dr. Chubby.

465
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:24,438
Okay, don't forget.

466
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,358
Chubby, where's Dr. Jiang?

467
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:31,398
He has matters
to take care of at home today.

468
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:32,598
Matters?

469
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:34,078
What could it be?

470
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:35,758
I'll go to him. Thank you.

471
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:37,638
Slow down.

472
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:57,278
Why are you so drunk?

473
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:02,238
Here. Drink with me.

474
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,038
What happened?

475
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:10,398
Tell me what's wrong.
Why are you torturing yourself?

476
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:13,278
What's the point of telling you?

477
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:20,158
Xiao Shuai, I'm no longer your weak
and incompetent student.

478
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,118
I can fix everything for you.

479
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:24,438
Give me a chance
to settle it for you.

480
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:27,038
You'll settle it for me?

481
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,758
You're the one
who caused the trouble.

482
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:35,318
Is it Chi Cheng?

483
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:38,758
I'll go to him.

484
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:43,158
Don't fight with Chi Cheng
because of me.

485
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,518
I told you.

486
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,918
We can't afford to mess
with people like him.

487
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:49,958
If only you stopped earlier.

488
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:52,838
If you stopped earlier,
this wouldn't have happened.

489
00:31:53,598 --> 00:31:55,558
I'm ready to die now.

490
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:58,078
Xiao Shuai.

491
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:00,518
Tell me what exactly happened.

492
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,758
Chi Cheng came to see me yesterday.

493
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,638
He said if you don't sleep with him,

494
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,118
I'll take your place instead.

495
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,478
Why?

496
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:21,598
This has nothing to do with you.

497
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:23,157
I wasn't supposed to be involved.

498
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,198
But have you forgotten?

499
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,758
Chi Cheng has been stealing
Guo Cheng Yu's guys.

500
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,198
Guo Cheng Yu
is interested in me now.

501
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:30,998
Because you were around,

502
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:32,638
Chi Cheng couldn't do
anything to me.

503
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:35,878
Now that you're not responding
to Chi Cheng...

504
00:32:36,478 --> 00:32:37,517
and I offended him,

505
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:39,678
he's aiming for me.

506
00:32:48,318 --> 00:32:49,318
Forget it.

507
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:51,278
I'm worthless anyway.

508
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:54,638
At worst, I'll just
get played again.

509
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:02,918
Sir.

510
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,037
Don't worry.

511
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:06,478
I'll take care of everything.

512
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:09,838
Da Wei, don't go.

513
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:17,718
Don't blame me.

514
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,278
Guo Cheng Yu, did you hear me?

515
00:33:25,358 --> 00:33:26,638
Xiao Shuai is in danger now.

516
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,134
Chi Cheng can't sleep with me,
so he's aiming for Xiao Shuai.

517
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:30,158
Got it.

518
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:32,358
You got it,
but you don't feel anything?

519
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,838
Then why don't you
just say yes to Chi Cheng?

520
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,598
Have you not strategized
against yourself enough...

521
00:33:39,238 --> 00:33:40,958
or do you not like men enough?

522
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,438
I don't want to talk about that
with you now.

523
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:55,758
So many guys...

524
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,638
can't get past this at first.

525
00:33:58,358 --> 00:33:59,958
I think you don't need
to worry too much.

526
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:03,837
After those people
slept with Chi Cheng,

527
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:05,398
they were all glowing.

528
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:09,958
"So many guys"?

529
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:11,878
How many did Chi Cheng sleep with?

530
00:34:15,038 --> 00:34:17,838
Are you happy
that you're one of them...

531
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:21,238
or are you angry
that you're just one of them?

532
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,398
Are you going to help or not?

533
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,478
How can I help?

534
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:34,118
Protect Xiao Shuai, of course,
to keep Chi Cheng away from him.

535
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:36,238
All right.

536
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:39,358
I'll pursue another guy...

537
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,078
and leave Jiang Xiao Shuai alone.

538
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,598
That way, he'll be safe.

539
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,038
That makes sense.

540
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:48,838
Go back and tell this
to your teacher.

541
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:50,398
Tell him...

542
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:51,878
that I don't like him anymore,

543
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:53,238
so he doesn't have to worry.

544
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:56,838
All right. I'll do that now.

545
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,958
Will you really stop pursuing
Jiang Xiao Shuai?

546
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,318
Quite the opposite.

547
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:13,598
This time,

548
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:16,478
he will come to me himself.

549
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:21,278
Sir.

550
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:23,078
I have great news.

551
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:24,358
Darn it, you drank so much.

552
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:25,958
Don't be sad anymore.

553
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,119
I solved the problem for you.

554
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:30,958
How did you solve it?

555
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:34,478
Don't tell me...

556
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,438
you really slept with Chi Cheng.

557
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,878
What are you thinking about?
How is that possible?

558
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,958
Then the problem isn't solved yet.

559
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:51,518
Let me tell you.

560
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,877
I found a way
to kill two birds with one stone.

561
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:55,357
It can get rid
of your mental struggle...

562
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:56,718
and resolve what's bothering me.

563
00:35:57,798 --> 00:35:59,518
If you don't listen to me,
you'll regret it.

564
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:02,918
I'm not listening.

565
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:05,958
Let me tell you.

566
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:08,038
I went to see Guo Cheng Yu today.

567
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:10,477
He promised me
he won't bother you from now on.

568
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:12,638
At the same time, he's planning
to pursue someone else.

569
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:14,278
You're safe now.

570
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:17,838
He's planning
to pursue someone else?

571
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,278
What's wrong?

572
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:23,438
Nothing.

573
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:25,038
That's good.

574
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:26,998
He won't bother me anymore.

575
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:28,798
That's good.
