00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,840
(Episode 11, Come on,
Let's Go Home and Get Registered)

3
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,080
Dr. Jiang, how many boxes
of aspirin do we need?

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
Three.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Three boxes.

6
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,920
There are only three days left...

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,600
until the ultimatum
Chi Cheng gave me.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
What should I do?

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Dr. Jiang.

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,600
It's been a while, Dr. Jiang.

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,200
Aren't you going
to pursue someone else?

12
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Why did you still come here?

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,960
If I'm pursuing someone else,

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,160
shouldn't you feel glad?

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
I am.

16
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Don't I look happy?

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,320
Don't I?

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,640
Dr. Jiang.

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,880
How can someone like you...

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,880
be someone's teacher?

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,720
Doctor.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
What's wrong?

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,519
She said
she doesn't want to live anymore.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
Treat her.

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,399
- Where are you going?
- Chubby!

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
- Get the first-aid kit.
- Okay.

27
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,800
- Cheng Yu, come and help me.
- Okay.

28
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,199
Let's go.

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Don't go.
Hurry.

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,120
You can both go first.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,399
I'll stay here.

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,320
Okay. I'll get going then.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Bye.

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
If her root problem isn't solved,

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,200
it's useless for you
to stay here either.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,040
If I don't watch over her,
it's the same as not saving her.

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
You should go home first.

38
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
I'm fine.

39
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,400
(The message was sent,
but was rejected by the other party)

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,359
You're awake.

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,440
Why did he do that to me?

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,719
Why?

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
Calm down first.

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Here. Let me see.

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Let go.

47
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Give it to me.

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,400
What's wrong?

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,320
Xiao Shuai, are you all right?

50
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Xiao Shuai.

51
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,839
- What exactly do you want?
- Cheng Yu, don't act this way.

52
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,920
Let her die.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
She's doing this over a guy.
Does she deserve to live?

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,880
Because of playboys like you,

55
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,279
those who take
relationships seriously...

56
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,600
lose the courage to love themselves.

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Xiao Shuai.

58
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,840
I was speaking up for you.

59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Are you okay?

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,279
Calm down.

61
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,239
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- It's okay.

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,160
I know it was an accident.

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
Lie down and rest.

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
Don't think too much first.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's all right.

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Get some rest.

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Xiao Shuai.

69
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Xiao Shuai.

70
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Xiao Shuai.

71
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,080
Let me treat your wound first.

72
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,919
I'm a doctor.

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
I can do it myself.

74
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,040
It's inconvenient for you
to do it yourself.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Let me do it.

76
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,120
Come on. Be careful.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Slowly.

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,879
It might hurt a little.

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,280
Bear with it a bit.

80
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Does it hurt?

81
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
I'll be gentle then.

82
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
Earlier,

83
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,840
didn't you leave?

84
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
I did.

85
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,720
I ran some errands,

86
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
then I came back.

87
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,760
It's late.

88
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,880
What errands could you have?

89
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Didn't Wu Suo Wei tell me...

90
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
to pursue someone else?

91
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,520
I went out to see...

92
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
if there's anyone suitable.

93
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Forget it.

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,880
I'll do it myself.

95
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Okay.

96
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,760
So...

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,880
you don't like that idea.

98
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's okay.

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,640
I'll think of another one for you.

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Endure it a bit.

101
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Dr. Jiang, I'm going home.

102
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,360
Thank you so much
for taking care of me.

103
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
Xiao Zhuang.

104
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
You must love yourself more.

105
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,279
Call me if you need anything.

106
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,560
(Xiao Zhuang)

107
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
What are you doing?

108
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
Get to the point.

109
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,640
I've come up...

110
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,280
with a perfect, new plan.

111
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Do you want to hear it?

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,920
What is it?

113
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
- Hello?
- Da Wei.

114
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,919
I have good news for you.

115
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
It will definitely make you happy.

116
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
What is it?

117
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,999
Chi Cheng's Snake Lord...

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,760
is coming back to the country
in three days.

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
His flight lands at midnight.

120
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
After that, we'll be free.

121
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,920
Snake Lord?

122
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
What Snake Lord?

123
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,040
Which Snake Lord
do you think I'm talking about?

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,960
The one Chi Cheng
has been missing for six years.

125
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
And for his sake,

126
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,879
he was willing to turn
against Guo Cheng Yu.

127
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,960
The handsome Mr. Wang.

128
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
So what if he's coming back?

129
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,559
What do you think?

130
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,400
If his original lover is back,
he'll have no time for us.

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,839
If that's the case,

132
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,560
Chi Cheng
will lose interest in you...

133
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,440
and won't bother me too.

134
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Guo Cheng Yu had a thing
with him before.

135
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,239
Maybe after he seduces Guo Cheng Yu,

136
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,800
I'll be completely free.

137
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,960
It's killing three birds
with one stone.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
When else can you get
something as great as this?

139
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
It's not bad.

140
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,080
Da Wei, tell me. Aren't we lucky?

141
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Yes.

142
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,080
I have a patient here.
I'll get back to work.

143
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Bye.

144
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Done.

145
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,440
You know what? My boyfriend
got back together with his ex.

146
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,719
It's okay.

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,599
I'll find you a better one, okay?

148
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,560
No, I just want him!

149
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Mr. Wu.

150
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
Let's get back to work first.

151
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Come on.

152
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Mr. Wu.

153
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Mr. Wu.

154
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
What's wrong?

155
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,680
I've checked this contract
with Legal Affairs.

156
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,280
Do you have any questions?

157
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
No.

158
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
I was thinking
about something else just now.

159
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Isn't Chi Cheng
the one checking this contract?

160
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,800
Why did you come to me this time?

161
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,919
I don't know
where Mr. Chi is these days.

162
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I can't reach him.

163
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Here.

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,880
These are loquats from my hometown.

165
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,160
Share them with our colleagues.

166
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Okay.

167
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
(Chi Cheng)

168
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Chi Cheng.

169
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,960
I've been waiting for so long.
I'm going to kill you, jerk!

170
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
You were freaking cheated on...

171
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
and you're still being a fool,
waiting there.

172
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,759
What did you tell me before?

173
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
You were so ruthless.

174
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,400
You said when he comes back,
you were going to kill him.

175
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Now that he's back,

176
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,160
you're sucking up to him.

177
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Darn it.

178
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,200
(Chi Cheng)

179
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm here to see Er Bao.

180
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes. That's what I'll say.

181
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Where's Chi Cheng?

182
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,440
He ended his lease.

183
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,240
When?

184
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Just a couple of days before.

185
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:01,399
Why did he end his lease?

186
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,960
Isn't it obvious?
He's from a rich family.

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
He just wants to stay here
for a change...

188
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,080
and experience life.

189
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,880
After a while,
who can stand living here?

190
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,000
"Experience life"?

191
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,960
You've experienced it for six years.

192
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,840
You could stand it at first,
but now you can't.

193
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,240
Poor Er Bao...

194
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,919
for being with a heartbreaker
like you.

195
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
I should've stolen
the snake back then.

196
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,519
What? What did you say?

197
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Nothing.

198
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
It's already the last day.

199
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
You're here.

200
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Looks like it's going to work today.

201
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,320
I can use reverse psychology now.

202
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,040
Da Wei, how's it going?

203
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Pretty good.

204
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,200
Good times are coming.
Let's go out for a meal.

205
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
We really need to celebrate.

206
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
What's wrong?

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
In the past few days, Chi Cheng...

208
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,960
really didn't bother you?

209
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
No.

210
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,159
At first, I was worried...

211
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,559
Chi Cheng would change his mind
halfway through.

212
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,320
After talking to Guo Cheng Yu,
I realized...

213
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
that we were worrying for nothing.

214
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,720
What did you two talk about?

215
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,960
What else?

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,200
About the three of them.

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
I realized...

218
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:32,440
that I'm becoming
more interested in Wang Shuo.

219
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,240
Before, I only thought
he was handsome and top-notch.

220
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,880
Now, I realized...

221
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,320
he's a heartthrob.

222
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,800
And he's very talented.

223
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,280
He's good at all Chinese
and Western instruments.

224
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,200
He held a concert in high school.

225
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,120
He even wrote a song for Chi Cheng.

226
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,200
And he's very fit.

227
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,280
He's a top-ranked national athlete.

228
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,679
Isn't that exaggerated?

229
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
No.

230
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,959
Guo Cheng Yu slept with him once...

231
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,840
and he's been reminiscing
about it for six years.

232
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,680
Let alone Chi Cheng...

233
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,880
who were with him for three years.

234
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,400
He'll reminisce about it
for the rest of his life.

235
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,960
Who can get rid...

236
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,760
of such a deep cancer.

237
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Can you?

238
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,160
You can't.

239
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,280
Look at your small frame.

240
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,640
It's obvious that you can't.

241
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,400
I don't even want to get rid of it.

242
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,319
Yes.

243
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
And he's very bold.
(Watch on www.kisskh.do to support Admin)

244
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,639
He dared to sleep
with another man...

245
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
behind Chi Cheng's back.

246
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,000
Do you dare to do that?
I'm sure you don't.

247
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,280
You don't even dare
to sleep with Chi Cheng,

248
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,280
let alone betray him.

249
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,480
That's because I don't like him.

250
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Yes.

251
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,200
You don't like him.

252
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,039
I'm just joking with you.

253
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,080
Why are you so mad?

254
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Mad?

255
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,399
Who's mad?
How can you say that I'm mad?

256
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,280
Look. You're getting angrier.

257
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,680
Da Wei.

258
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,440
You look pale.

259
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
What's wrong?

260
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,760
Is there something on your mind?

261
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,560
I'm too excited.

262
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,439
Da Bao.

263
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
Anyone can be mad at me,

264
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
but not you.

265
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
Because when you're angry,

266
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll be anxious.

267
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,520
Even if you don't do anything,

268
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
I'll still like you.

269
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
I promise.

270
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,760
In the future,
I won't let you get hurt again.

271
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
You're just my little loser.

272
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,080
I'm mesmerized by your loser aura.

273
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Liar.

274
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,400
You're such a liar.

275
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,880
It's already 11pm.

276
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,640
Only one more hour...

277
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,880
before you reconcile with the man
you love but can't have.

278
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,000
After another hour,

279
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,920
we'll have nothing to do
with each other, Chi Cheng.

280
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,040
Hang in there.

281
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
With this slight breeze,

282
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,520
tomorrow will be
another beautiful day.

283
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
What time is it?

284
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,800
Darn it. Why isn't it midnight yet?

285
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,560
He's a heartthrob.

286
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,760
And he's very talented.

287
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,200
He's good at all Chinese
and Western instruments.

288
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,079
Guo Cheng Yu slept with him once...

289
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
and he's been reminiscing
about it for six years.

290
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
Let alone Chi Cheng.

291
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,600
I used to fantasize
about being with him forever.

292
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
If his original lover is back,

293
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,880
Chi Cheng will lose interest in you.

294
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,999
I don't care if you can
write songs or not.

295
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,239
I don't care if you're bold!
I don't care if you're fit!

296
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
He's mine now.

297
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,719
You're mine now!

298
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
Get lost as far as you can!

299
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,880
I thought you wouldn't show up
until 11:59pm.

300
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,160
Looks like I overestimated
your willpower.

301
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,640
You're mine.

302
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
I'm yours.

303
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,960
Then you can't sleep
with him from now on.

304
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
I won't sleep with him.

305
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Only with you.

306
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,800
Then from now on,

307
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
when you're with me,

308
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,320
don't think about him.

309
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Don't worry.

310
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
Why would I think about him?

311
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,640
I'm warning you.

312
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,319
That's all his own business.

313
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,879
No matter how talented he is,
it's his business.

314
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,159
From now on, you'll only hear
my clear singing voice.

315
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,360
No matter how fit he is,
it's still his business.

316
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
You shouldn't be concerned
about his body.

317
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,280
You should be concerned about
the wound on my neck and chest.

318
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,240
I don't care if he's bold.

319
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,399
Don't use his integrity
as a standard...

320
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
and treat my self-respect...

321
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
as nothing.

322
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
Jiang Xiao Shuai is really good
at making things up.

323
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
All right.

324
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
I told you. I'm yours.

325
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,040
Are you mine then?

326
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Of course.

327
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Fine.

328
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,960
Since you're mine,

329
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,840
shouldn't we get a certificate?

330
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,840
In this society, it's really hard
if you don't have a certificate.

331
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Think about it.

332
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,840
If you don't have
a certificate with me,

333
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,200
who will you complain to
if I run away one day?

334
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
If you run away,

335
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,520
I'll find someone else
to get a certificate with.

336
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,320
Who the heck dares to steal my man?

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
What?

338
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
What are you doing?

339
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,999
I'm at a friend's house.

340
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,040
That Snake Lord's flight lands
at midnight in three days.

341
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm busy.

342
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,719
If you're not free to come home now,

343
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,759
I'll make time tomorrow...

344
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,880
to tear down your stupid
art installation company.

345
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
- Come on.
- Wait for me.
Let's continue with the certificate.

346
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I have to go home.

347
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
My dad called me.

348
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Was it really your dad?

349
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,360
It really was.

350
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
Since your dad is calling you
at this hour,

351
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
it must be urgent.
Go.

352
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,480
Do you think it's easy for me
to wait for this day?

353
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Wait for me to come back.

354
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Young Master Guo.

355
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,400
Do you think Chi Cheng succeeded?

356
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,120
He scared Jiang Xiao Shuai so much.

357
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
How can I easily let him succeed?

358
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
Ask to meet Wu Suo Wei.

359
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
Tell him...

360
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,360
it's to discuss a collaboration.

361
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Where?

362
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
Shengshi Club.

363
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,039
That's intense.

364
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,960
(Shengshi Club)

365
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,080
- Don't be shy.
- Young Master Guo.

366
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Xiao Tian.

367
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,120
Behave yourself.

368
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm here to talk business.

369
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,760
Do you come here often?

370
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,920
Not as often as Chi Cheng.

371
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Let's go.

372
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,599
By the way, Young Master Chi
hasn't been here for a long time.

373
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,960
What has he been up to lately?
I miss him so much.

374
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
We're here.
Come on.

375
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,639
Accompany him well today, guys.

376
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,000
- Okay.
- Sure!

377
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,639
I need to take this call.

378
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Have fun.

379
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,080
You're straight, right?

380
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Yes.

381
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
Does Chi Cheng come here often?

382
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,000
For a period of time,
he came here every day.

383
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
He even stayed the night.

384
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
What does he do here?

385
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,240
What do you think?

386
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Could he really...

387
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,280
come here to sing and dance?

388
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,920
Mr. Chi likes hardcore things.

389
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,880
When you entered, did you notice
the second room by the door?

390
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,639
As soon as Mr. Chi enters it,

391
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,999
the room is filled
with cries and moans.

392
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,520
He's so into it.

393
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,840
Did he pick you many times?

394
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
I'm the one he picks the most.

395
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
He says I'm obedient.

396
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,680
He can torture me...

397
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,000
however he wants.

398
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,919
Look.

399
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,240
Look at this cigarette burn.

400
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,920
Young Master Chi did it.

401
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,999
Why are you leaving?

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
Something came up at work.
I have to go.

403
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,239
Come on. Let's have fun!

404
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,360
Let's have fun!

405
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,320
He hasn't shown up all day.

406
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,560
He didn't contact me either.

407
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,280
He must have completed the mission.

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,320
Please bless me.

409
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,560
Please let it be successful.

410
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Please.

411
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I'm so mad.

412
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
What's wrong? What happened?

413
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,640
I accidentally entered
Chi Cheng's den of lust.

414
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,960
The male escort told me
all about his dirty secrets.

415
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,760
Now, I want to destroy him.

416
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Isn't it too late
for you to find out now?

417
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,080
Didn't you already sleep
with Chi Cheng yesterday?

418
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,440
Almost.

419
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,640
If his dad
didn't call him home urgently,

420
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,800
I'd regret that to death.

421
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
Why would I sleep with him?

422
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,040
He's lucky if I don't break up
with him.

423
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
It's over.

424
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
All my efforts are in vain.

425
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Why are you here?

426
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,200
Is there anyone else at your home?

427
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,520
No. Why?

428
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,840
Can I hide here
for a couple of days?

429
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Please.

430
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,000
You can hide here forever.

431
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,560
If you say that,
I'll get going then.

432
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Don't go.

433
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Then...

434
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,520
what about the clinic?

435
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,160
This is good for me.
I can rest for a couple of days.

436
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Rest?

437
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
This place...

438
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,080
is most suitable for resting.

439
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Let's go.

440
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'll be gentle.

441
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,040
He has a private doctor at home.

442
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,080
Why does he keep coming
to my clinic then?

443
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,000
Take a look.
What do you want to eat?

444
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I'll make it for you.

445
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,400
Where have you been?

446
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,400
I haven't been able to reach you
since last night.

447
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,480
Can't you hear me?

448
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Don't touch me.

449
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,679
What does this mean?

450
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,800
I think you're dirty.

451
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,640
- What?
- I said,

452
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
I think...

453
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,400
you're dirty.

454
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,879
You think I'm dirty?

455
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,479
Yes, Shengshi Club's
No. 6 male escort, Xiao Tian,

456
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,760
asked me to tell you...

457
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,320
that he misses you.

458
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,280
Did you have to go there
to investigate me?

459
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,760
I don't know
how many people I've slept with.

460
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,440
I used to be this dirty.

461
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,080
It's not too late
for you to regret it now.

462
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,239
If I regret it,
would I have scolded you?

463
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,519
What's wrong
with scolding you a bit?

464
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,600
For the little dirty things you did,
shouldn't I scold you?

465
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm unhappy.
I just want to say it out loud.

466
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,560
I think you're dirty.

467
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
I think you're dirty.

468
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,640
Are you and Wu Suo Wei...

469
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,160
still together?

470
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
What do you mean?

471
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,320
Do you want us to break up?

472
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,080
No. I just see that
you're not in a good mood.

473
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,880
He won't let me touch him.

474
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
Why?

475
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
He...

476
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,560
thinks I'm dirty.

477
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,880
How dare he think...

478
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,440
that you're...

479
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,560
Why?

480
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
He dug up my dirty secrets.

481
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,240
Isn't this karma?

482
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
What?

483
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,760
Say that again.

484
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,600
I didn't say anything.

485
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,680
Pull over at the pharmacy.

486
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
What's the matter?

487
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Get me some medicine.

488
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
What medicine?

489
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,840
Something that can
freaking decrease my libido.

490
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,920
This won't do.

491
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,680
I have to think of something.

492
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,920
Size 80.

493
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,000
Size 82.1.

494
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
This is...

495
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Xiao Tian.

496
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,599
Chi Cheng and I have arrived
Shengshi Club.

497
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,840
- When are you coming?
- Shengshi Club?

498
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,799
I'm sorry. I sent it by mistake.

499
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,880
He sent it by mistake?

500
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Darn it.

501
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,440
He went there again.

502
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,800
I knew he wouldn't be able
to endure it.

503
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,000
That perverted mutt!

504
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,320
I'm going to kill him!

505
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Mr. Chi.

506
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,520
Didn't you say
a client wants to see me...

507
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,040
to order some art installations?

508
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,160
Why did you bring me here?

509
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,759
The client will be here soon.

510
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,880
Let's have some fun first.

511
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,480
Young Master Chi,
you're finally here.

512
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Get lost.

513
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Young Master Chi, he kicked me.

514
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Young Master Chi.

515
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,320
I'll spank him when we get home.

516
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,680
Listen up, everyone!

517
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,399
From now on,

518
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,720
we will bid this place
farewell forever.

519
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm sorry for not supporting
your business anymore.

520
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,959
Who wants to see him?

521
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
Take a good look.

522
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Once he's out of this door,

523
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:37,080
you won't get the chance
to look at him again.

524
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,840
What does this mean?

525
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,240
Let's go home and get a certificate.

526
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,000
It's really worrying when you go out
without a certificate nowadays.

527
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Where are we?

528
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,200
My new home.

529
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
However...

530
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
It's going to be
your new home soon too,

531
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,680
my little master.
