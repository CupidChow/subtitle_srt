1
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
"Revenged Love"

2
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
(Episode 6: My heart is all shaken up)

3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
You really are such a stubborn little mule.

4
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Give it a smack.

5
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Take a step.

6
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,359
No swing, no shot.

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,800
Your butt's practically
sticking up to the sky.

8
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,159
I'm hungry.

9
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,879
Alright.

10
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,319
I'll let you eat first.

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Wait for me.

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
Almost let him have his way.

13
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,639
It's so hot.

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
It's so hot.

15
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,560
Chi Cheng, seriously...

16
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,039
To raise snakes.

17
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,679
Locking himself up in
such a hot and humid place.

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
This water is all hot.

19
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,832
He didn't give it to Yue Yue.

20
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,240
One, two, three.

21
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,719
Four, five.

22
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,960
Not a single one is missing.

23
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,879
So fast.

24
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:48,374
These are all your favorites.

25
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,039
Should I leave now?

26
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,903
If I don't leave now, I really
won't be able to get away.

27
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,039
Honey, why didn't you pick up my call?

28
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,318
I've been with her for so long.

29
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,399
It was never this sweet.

30
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,880
They've only been
together for a few months.

31
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Calling him hubby.

32
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,319
Stop messing around.

33
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,079
Are you ticklish?

34
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,079
Not afraid.

35
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
I've never been afraid since I was a kid.

36
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,599
And you still say
you're not afraid of this.

37
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,160
Let me give it a try.

38
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
How are you going to try?

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Look at you.

40
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,159
You've already been with so many guys.

41
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,759
So experienced.

42
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,879
It's not like one more makes a difference.

43
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,800
I've never been with a guy before.

44
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,439
Let me give it a try.

45
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Have some fun.

46
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,199
Get your thrill from me.

47
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Seek death.

48
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,919
Chi Cheng, I'm warning you.

49
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,439
Don't do anything reckless.

50
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
If you dare turn me down, I'll ruin you.

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Chi Cheng.

52
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,039
If you dare get on top of me right now...

53
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,599
We can only ever be physical.

54
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,920
In my heart, I will never yield.

55
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,318
Are you seriously trying to
negotiate with me right now?

56
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:58,423
Then say something.

57
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
What are you thinking?

58
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,680
All you do is hit me.

59
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
What does it even matter?

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Say something.

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Get out of my way.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How about it?

63
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Think about it.

64
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,206
I think it's pretty good.

65
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
What about you?

66
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
Keep dating your girlfriend.

67
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,439
When you have some free time.

68
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Just come find me.

69
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,480
Having someone in each arm.

70
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,920
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

71
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Right?

72
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Not bad at all.

73
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
What's so good about it?

74
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,239
Let's give it a try, just the two of us.

75
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:51,879
Get lost.

76
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,879
Get out of my way.

77
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
The acting here is way over the top.

78
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,959
He's in all my dreams.

79
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:10,984
What are you pretending?

80
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,135
If you dare to get on
top of me right now...

81
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,999
All we can ever be is
a physical relationship.

82
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,399
You need to watch your diet from now on.

83
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,000
Alright.

84
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,456
And make sure to take
your medicine on time.

85
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Alright.

86
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,686
Staying out all night, you.

87
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Master.

88
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,879
Touch my waist.

89
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,799
Why?

90
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,279
Just leave it.

91
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,879
What's wrong?

92
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
That's strange, I don't feel anything.

93
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,758
Why did he touch my waist?

94
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,759
Such a big reaction.

95
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,879
It's nothing.

96
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,879
Suowei.

97
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,799
Let me tell you something.

98
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:40,944
Let's go.

99
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,559
Suowei

100
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,799
I'm with Li Wang.

101
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
I found out some things about Chi Cheng.

102
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,439
Not sure if it's useful.

103
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Go ahead.

104
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,518
Guo Chengyu and Chi Cheng are love rivals.

105
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,559
What?

106
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,039
No.

107
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,398
Chi Cheng's boyfriend from college.

108
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,399
Wang Shuo.

109
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
Slept with Guo Chengyu.

110
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
This incident.

111
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,759
It directly led to Chi Cheng
and Wang Shuo breaking up.

112
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
And then?

113
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,159
And then this guy went abroad.

114
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,918
Originally, Chi Cheng and Guo Chengyu.

115
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,879
They were as close as
brothers, thick as thieves.

116
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,679
After what happened.

117
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,456
The two of them kept up appearances, but deep
down, they were no longer on the same page.

118
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,600
In the six years since
they graduated from college.

119
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,919
As long as it's a guy Guo Chengyu likes.

120
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
Chi Cheng would always have
to steal them away from him.

121
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,879
Damn.

122
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,390
What if he finds out
about my ulterior motives?

123
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,559
He'd have to grind me into the ground.

124
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,159
So you need to think it through.

125
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,320
I really can't do it.

126
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,839
Then get out as soon as you can.

127
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,080
You can't afford to mess
with someone like that.

128
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,559
Master.

129
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I might.

130
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,360
There's no way to get out of this now.

131
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,519
It's nothing.

132
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:05,135
As your mentor, I'll go meet
this Guo Chengyu for you.

133
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
That works too.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,639
Let me sound out this Wang Shuo for you.

135
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,641
I have reason to suspect.
You're just doing this for the gossip, right?

136
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Mom.

137
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,720
Xiao Chi really is a good kid.

138
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,319
These are from him again.

139
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,919
Yes.

140
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,519
He was just here yesterday.

141
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,679
He dropped off the
stuff and left right away.

142
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,919
Look.

143
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,879
This is the purple lingzhi he gave me.

144
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,480
He said it can lower cholesterol.

145
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,720
So thoughtful.

146
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,159
Mom.

147
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,615
I can't accept a reward I haven't earned.

148
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,879
I think I'd better not accept these things.

149
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,159
You're right.

150
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,639
I should return the favor.

151
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,600
Daqiong

152
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,279
I just came from the fields.

153
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,279
Picked some corn.

154
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,960
Last time

155
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,000
I've noticed Xiao Chi
really likes to eat it.

156
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,519
Take some back for him.

157
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,720
Alright.

158
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,961
I'll cook it for him right now.

159
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Bring it.

160
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Bring it.

161
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,280
Where did the corn come from?

162
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,039
Give me one.

163
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
I happened to skip lunch.

164
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,279
If you're hungry, go buy it yourself.

165
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,495
How did things go with
what I asked you to do?

166
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,119
I've made contact with the snake dealer.

167
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,399
You guessed it right.

168
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,919
There's more than one person
selling snake eggs on the sly.

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,879
I found someone reliable.

170
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,015
Everything's been taken care of.

171
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,679
We can swap out the snake any minute now.

172
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,999
My dad didn't notice, right?

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No.

174
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,056
The cafeteria is kept a close watch.

175
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Those chefs are still eyeing us like hawks.

176
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,719
The snake must still be in the cellar.

177
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Didn't move an inch.

178
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Hey.

179
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Let me tell you.

180
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,359
Today's really going to wear me out.

181
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
What have you been up to?

182
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,559
Cleared out two new snake rooms.

183
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,399
Took care of a few nests of old snakes.

184
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,159
No, it was the snake matriarch.

185
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,600
So, when these snakes
are laying eggs, tell me...

186
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,279
Why are they so temperamental?

187
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,479
I want to move them to a new spot.

188
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
They bit me.

189
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,519
It bit you.

190
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,176
No, it didn't actually bite me.

191
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
You know how quick my reflexes are.

192
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,600
It's going to rain tomorrow.

193
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,920
Remember to take an
umbrella when you go out.

194
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,200
Something's up.

195
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Hanging up.

196
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Hung up.

197
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,639
Who are you calling?

198
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,678
You've been acting strange lately.

199
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,719
Called you ten times.

200
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,920
Nine times, the line was busy.

201
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,600
And each call lasts half an hour.

202
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,599
So you didn't used to call every time.

203
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
Not even a minute?

204
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,799
Why are you suddenly
getting all emotional lately?

205
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,440
I heard.

206
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,281
Chi Cheng's sister will
be back in a few days.

207
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
That's going to be lively.

208
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,120
A couple of days ago, Jiang Xiaoshuai.

209
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,401
He even asked me about you, too.

210
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,960
Do you think he might be interested in you?

211
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,279
He.

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,278
Did he happen to ask about Chi Cheng too?

213
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,039
He asked about it.

214
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,375
But I feel like something's off.

215
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,000
I brushed him off with a vague answer.

216
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He brushed it off.

217
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Do you believe it?

218
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,879
Hold on.

219
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
When we passed by
the entrance of his clinic

220
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Jiang Xiaoshuai.

221
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
He's definitely going
to stop the two of us.

222
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,840
Guo Shao.

223
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:04,639
I'm watching him.

224
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,720
That doesn't look like
someone who'd try to stop us.

225
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,639
Just wait and see.

226
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Dr. Jiang.

227
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,519
Watering the flowers.

228
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,639
Relaxed.

229
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,279
Alright.

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Let's go.

231
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Alright.

232
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Get out of the car.

233
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,080
What's wrong, Dr. Jiang?

234
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,696
I've got something urgent to take care of.

235
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,760
Could you please make way?

236
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,159
You've got a very serious illness.

237
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,639
Really? What kind of illness?

238
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
When I was with you,

239
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,719
it felt like my life
flashing before my eyes.

240
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
If you want to survive.

241
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,279
Come with me.

242
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Awesome.

243
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Dr. Jiang.

244
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,166
So, what about my condition?

245
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,639
How should it be treated?

246
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,639
I need you to give selflessly.

247
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
Boundless love.

248
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,720
I heard you have a pet snake paradise.

249
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,200
I have a buddy.

250
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,679
He wants to keep snakes too.

251
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,679
Wants to learn from your experience.

252
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,600
So how does he want to learn?

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,240
You take such good care of your snakes.

254
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,679
It must have taken a long time, right?

255
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,680
Yeah, it's been quite a while.

256
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,000
I started keeping snakes back in college.

257
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,960
Finally, we've hit the key point.

258
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,678
Your college life with Chi Cheng.

259
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,759
So interesting.

260
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,960
You probably had other friends
who kept snakes too, right?

261
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,720
What do you think?

262
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,599
But honestly, that's true.

263
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,079
Back when we were in college.

264
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,160
Only the usual suspects show up.

265
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,759
Someone who spared no expense
when it comes to keeping snakes.

266
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,240
The legendary Wang Shuo
is finally about to surface.

267
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
But now,

268
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,359
I'm the only one left now.

269
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,240
All his snakes are gone.

270
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,480
There's only one left.

271
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,880
Always kept by my side.

272
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,920
The person you're talking about.

273
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Could it be...

274
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,039
That's right.

275
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
You know this person too.

276
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,000
He is Chi Cheng.

277
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,039
Are you messing with me?

278
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,880
Why is Chi Cheng's snake gone?

279
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,240
The son doesn't listen,
the father lays down the law.

280
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,758
If he doesn't get his snake taken away,

281
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,479
How would he end up
obediently going to work?

282
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
In other words,

283
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,799
Chi Cheng's job.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,360
It was all arranged by his father.

285
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
It's over.

286
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,400
Then let's keep talking.

287
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,200
How do you cure my illness?

288
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,976
The front desk just said
someone's here to see me.

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,759
It's you.

290
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,759
Yes.

291
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Brother Gang.

292
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,079
Let me ask you something.

293
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,160
Chi Cheng's situation.

294
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Yeah.

295
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,799
Exactly.

296
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,880
Have you been with Chi
Cheng for many years too?

297
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,880
So, was he like that from the very
beginning? Not even his own company.

298
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,079
No, he started out
focusing on raising snakes.

299
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Yeah, true.

300
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,318
So can he actually stick
it out at the company?

301
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,679
Looks like he's already switched
departments several times.

302
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,416
Even if he can't stand
it, he still has to stay.

303
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,079
All his precious snakes
are in the chairman's hands.

304
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,879
Then if they tell him to
go east, he goes east.

305
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,560
If they tell him to go west, he goes west.

306
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,839
He doesn't dare to disobey.

307
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,679
So his job really is...

308
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,720
His father arranged it.

309
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
I thought he was
doing it just to get at me.

310
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,400
Why am I only realizing this now?

311
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,759
Someone as headstrong as Chi Cheng.

312
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,319
How could he possibly be
controlled by his girlfriend?

313
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,759
I have something else to do.

314
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,559
You go ahead and take care
of your things. I'll get going now.

315
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,039
Why am I so popular today?

316
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,599
Sister Yue.

317
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,640
Xiaogang, there's
something I want to ask you.

318
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Go ahead, Yue.

319
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,599
Lately, I've been calling Chi Cheng.

320
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,880
Why is he always on a call?

321
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,359
He...

322
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,880
He.

323
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,359
Did he meet someone new?

324
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,279
I've been calling him nonstop.

325
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,759
Xiao Gang.

326
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,359
Sister Yue.

327
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,759
It's fine. Just tell me who she is.

328
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,160
I won't tell anyone.

329
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,360
I honestly have no idea about this.

330
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
I'm done, I'm done.

331
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,919
From now on, just go
ahead and charge forward.

332
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,200
The bully's got your back.

333
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,279
He didn't give it to anyone else.

334
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Look.

335
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,359
This is the purple lingzhi he gave.

336
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,599
They say it can lower cholesterol.

337
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
So mature and understanding.

338
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Let it go.

339
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,680
Tell him the whole truth.

340
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,359
What's wrong with you?

341
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm not in a good mood right now.

342
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
You go back first.

343
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,039
Actually,

344
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,760
You can't hear me talking anymore, can you?

345
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,079
I told you to go back.

346
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,119
I'm damn well not leaving today.

347
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,481
I want to see just what kind of
punishment you think you can give me.

348
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Sorry.

349
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,079
If I'd known, I never should've
drugged you in the first place.

350
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,079
Originally.

351
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
I can barely feel anything anymore.

352
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,719
Can you go back for today, please?

353
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,559
I'll come find you early tomorrow.

354
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Wait for me.

355
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
It's his birthday today.

356
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,039
When he gave me Little Vinegar.

357
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,200
You could lift it with just one hand.

358
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Six years.

359
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,119
He probably doesn't remember any of it.

360
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,401
You must remember what
Little Vinegar looked like, right?

361
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,079
How long have you been with him?

362
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,279
Over three years.

363
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Three years.

364
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,000
They've been together for three years.

365
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,679
In the end, six years have gone
by and I still haven't found any relief.

366
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,559
I was with her for three years too.

367
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,439
How much longer will it
take for me to move on?

368
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,279
If it weren't for Wang Shuo.

369
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,961
With the kind of childhood
friendship Chengyu and I have,

370
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,759
It wouldn't have come to this today.

371
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,759
Good thing he knew his place.

372
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:41,320
Hurry up and get out of the country.

373
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,799
If I ever see him again.

374
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,240
I swear I'll kill him.

375
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,519
Da Bao.

376
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
Have you ever experienced it?

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
With a romantic rival.

378
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,239
Do you know what it feels like
to greet someone with a smile?

379
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,759
Isn't that exactly what
you're experiencing right now?

380
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
I've experienced it for a full six years.

381
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,598
I've experienced it too.

382
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,839
It's been over six months.

383
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Da Bao.

384
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
-You're still the best.

385
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,359
A pure soul.

386
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Your heart is pure, too.

387
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,199
I'm going to get a drink of water.

388
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,518
I used to fantasize about it.

389
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,279
Spending a lifetime with him.

390
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,719
Thinking about it now,
it's honestly laughable.

391
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,160
When you're in love.

392
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,960
Who isn't a fool like that?

393
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Yue Yue and I.

394
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,639
We almost ended up meeting
each other's parents, too.

395
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:46,454
Do you think I'm just
completely obsessed with love?

396
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
No.

397
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm talking about my own issues.

398
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Why are you crying?

399
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Who's crying for you?

400
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,359
I'm crying about my own stuff.

401
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,319
I feel guilty in my heart.

402
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,319
What do you have to feel guilty about?

403
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,319
Actually, I...

404
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm not pure at all.

405
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,759
Alright, give it to me.

406
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,599
Hello.

407
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,000
What are you thinking about?

408
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Yesterday, I...

409
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,799
Went to find Xiao Gang.

410
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,000
He said Chi Cheng changed jobs.

411
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,519
It's because of his dad.

412
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,199
It has absolutely nothing to do with me.

413
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,119
So what?

414
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,119
So?

415
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:05,216
Chi Cheng has absolutely no idea.

416
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:06,318
I have an ex-girlfriend.

417
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,319
Call Yue Yue.

418
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,959
Every time he comes
looking for trouble with me.

419
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,319
It was just a coincidence, that's all.

420
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,280
So you two really are quite fated, huh.

421
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
Even if it's fate, it's a twisted one.

422
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,120
You took revenge on the wrong person.

423
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,880
So, what are you planning to do next?

424
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,599
I don't know.

425
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,480
How about we just let it go?

426
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,599
Yeah.

427
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,440
You've thought about it, haven't you?

428
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,319
Who?

429
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,559
Yue Yue.

430
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,279
How did she get my new number?

431
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,639
You little tease, are you
trying to play innocent with me?

432
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,280
I'd like to see who's got
the guts to pull this off.

433
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,167
You even dare to steal Yue Yue's man?

434
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Hello?

435
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Man.

436
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:05,519
Who are you?

437
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,119
Wu Qiqiong.

438
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,359
Why is it you?

439
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,278
The call you made to me.

440
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,359
Why are you asking me that?

441
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,456
I went through all that trouble to
track down this harassing phone call.

442
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,880
Turns out it was my ex-boyfriend's.

443
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,880
Have you been using this number all along?

444
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,759
Have you always used the
same number with everyone else?

445
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
Wu Qiqiong, you have no shame.

446
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
How am I shameless?

447
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,279
Are you jealous because
I'm doing better than you?

448
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,440
Deliberately calling my boyfriend
to stir up trouble between us.

449
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,679
Wu Qiqiong, let me tell you something.

450
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
Stop playing mind games with me.

451
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,199
There's no way I'd
ever be interested in you.

452
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,279
Just give up on that idea.

453
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,358
Stop calling my boyfriend from now on.

454
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,558
Stop bringing me up in front of him.

455
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,799
Otherwise, I won't let this go.

456
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,759
As long as you don't mention
me in front of him, that's fine.

457
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
You think you deserve it?

458
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,335
You really think you're
something special, don't you?

459
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,999
Just mentioning you would dirty his ears.

460
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I've made up my mind.

461
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
What's your plan?

462
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,559
I'm definitely going to take her down.

463
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,160
My cactus.

464
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,519
Kid.

465
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Kids, don't be afraid.

466
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,279
I don't want to.

467
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,119
Parent.

468
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,880
Parents, please help calm them down.

469
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,359
It'll be fine in just a moment.

470
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,079
It'll be fine in a moment.

471
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,199
Go ahead and take care
of your things, I've got this.

472
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,279
Come here.

473
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,599
Baby, look.

474
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,960
What is this?

475
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,199
What's this?

476
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Cactus.

477
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Do you like it?

478
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Look at that little ring on top of it.

479
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,759
Isn't it adorable?

480
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,079
Cute.

481
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,759
Every time you come here
from now on, I'll give you one.

482
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,039
Alright.

483
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,559
You can now.

484
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,559
Healthy and well.

485
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,559
Heading home.

486
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,920
Goodbye, Brother Xiaoshuai.

487
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Goodbye.

488
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Thank you, doctor.

489
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,599
Hey handsome.

490
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,240
Can I treat you to a meal?

491
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:01,839
I heard.

492
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,240
A new Thai restaurant just opened nearby.

493
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,079
Very.

494
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,119
No.

495
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,119
Wrong.

496
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,119
You don't have to go
out of your way for me.

497
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
How.

498
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,936
All the tricks you wanted to
play have already been played.

499
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
I've figured out everything
I needed to know.

500
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,119
The way I am now.

501
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,640
No more use for me.

502
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Is that right?

503
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,640
I don't know.

504
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,721
What are you talking about?

505
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,079
But.

506
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,519
There are still things I want to
understand that I haven't figured out yet.

507
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,799
That... what was it?

508
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,519
Wu Suowei.

509
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,480
Close to my brother.

510
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,920
What exactly is he after?

511
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
What do you mean?

512
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,759
The game of falling for your rival in love.

513
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Is it fun?

514
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,720
Don't tell Chi Cheng about this.

515
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Try this shrimp.

516
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,160
This was just a coincidence.

517
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,879
He also got involved with Chi Cheng.

518
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,680
Only then did I find
out he has a girlfriend.

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,078
He's afraid Chi Cheng will find out.

520
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,240
That's why I never told him.

521
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,680
The tom yum soup here is really good.

522
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Here.

523
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,640
I've served you a bowl to try.

524
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,599
Give it a try.

525
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,055
I know there's bad blood
between you and Chi Cheng.

526
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,079
But.

527
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,200
That mouth of yours.

528
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,839
Is it only good for talking?

529
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,279
Tastes pretty good.

530
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,359
This place is so out of the way.

531
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,559
How did you find out?

532
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
My company.

533
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,519
There's a dedicated
gourmet tasting department.

534
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,999
They specialize in tracking down
delicious food from all over the place.

535
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Like this.

536
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,639
I'll wait until you're not busy.

537
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:38,464
I'll take you to check out
each place, one by one.

538
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
So.

539
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,720
Do you really want to
take me out for a meal?

540
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
So what do you want?

541
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,759
Is there any further development?

542
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Go ahead, dig in.

543
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,760
So, what do you think? Not bad, right?

544
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,359
The food here is pretty good.

545
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,760
Guo Chengyu really knows how to eat.

546
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,840
Looks like he's not
completely useless after all.

547
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,159
Perfect timing, I've been
craving Thai food lately.

548
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,079
I've watched a ton of
short videos like this.

549
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
I'm absolutely craving it.

550
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Master.

551
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,038
Why do I feel like.

552
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,320
Looks like someone's got
you wrapped around their finger.

553
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,560
Disciple, you must not speak recklessly.

554
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,400
Let me, as your master,
help you with your homework.

555
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,200
How have things been
between you two lately?

556
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,416
Been busy these past couple of days.

557
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
I ignored him.

558
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,120
Is it that you're busy,
or do you feel guilty?

559
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:04,599
What about him?

560
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,479
He hasn't reached out to you at all?

561
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
No.

562
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,759
Ever since we had drinks together last time.

563
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,679
He just hasn't reached out to me at all.

564
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Did you two do anything besides drinking?

565
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,679
Just talked.

566
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,880
He also told me about
his past relationships.

567
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,880
I've never seen him like that before.

568
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Sounds like it.

569
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,760
Kind of pathetic.

570
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,400
Is that even possible?

571
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,280
Someone as assertive as him.

572
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,038
Suddenly showing that side in front of you.

573
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,359
A side of him no one's ever seen.

574
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,159
Looking back on it, isn't
it kind of embarrassing?

575
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,239
He.

576
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,039
Do you have the nerve?

577
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,559
I don't believe it.

578
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,719
Try giving them a call.

579
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,960
Hello?

580
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
What are you up to?

581
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,799
Having dinner with friends.

582
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,640
Who are you having dinner with?

583
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,456
Is there something important?

584
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Nothing, I'm hanging up.

585
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,599
Why is Chi Shao being so polite today?

586
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,000
It's just that...

587
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,681
Don't you usually just hang up right away?

588
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,719
Shut up.

589
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,400
Is there something important?

590
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
You tell me.

591
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,279
After I went to see you last time.

592
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,159
Didn't you tell me a lot about your past?

593
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,999
I went back and thought it over.

594
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
I think so.

595
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
It's over.

596
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Hung up.

597
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,480
You really called it.

598
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I told you so.

599
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,599
He's just embarrassed.

600
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,519
This guy.

601
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Pretty funny.

602
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,599
Let me tell you.

603
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,039
Brother Gang.

604
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Why did he leave?

605
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
You mean Chi Shao?

606
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,799
It's been like this these past few days.

607
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,175
When I walk with him, I have to
keep at least three meters away.

608
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,279
That face was so sour.

609
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,039
Come on, come on, come on.

610
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,039
Let's have a drink.

611
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,119
I'm ready.

612
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,800
Get ready for a long battle.

613
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,119
Now Chi Cheng and Yue Yue.

614
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,519
They definitely won't be
breaking up anytime soon.

615
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,559
Why?

616
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,240
Didn't Chi Cheng stop loving Yue Yue?

617
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,719
Chi Cheng raised a group of snakes.

618
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,480
His dad is holding his snakes hostage.

619
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,920
If he wants to keep those snakes alive.

620
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,560
He has no choice but to
obey his father's arrangements.

621
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,239
So Chi Cheng's father
is satisfied with Yue Yue.

622
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,840
-You can't really say that.

623
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,000
His dad thinks.

624
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,759
Better to have him hang
out with a girl than with guys.

625
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,639
As long as it's a woman.

626
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,119
His dad would definitely agree.

627
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,639
So if Chi Cheng wanted to be with you.

628
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,159
Would he really be willing to give
up that whole group of snakes?

629
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,159
Impossible.

630
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,118
With the little games Chi
Cheng and I are playing right now.

631
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,680
There's no way it could ever shake
that group of snakes he cares for so much.

632
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,480
That makes things difficult.

633
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,160
It's not like there's no way.

634
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,079
I'm planning to.

635
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Force a breakup.

636
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,639
Forced demolition.

637
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,879
Do you know what Yue Yue is most afraid of?

638
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,679
Snakes.

639
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,719
She must absolutely hate Little Vinegar by now.

640
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,159
Scheming to get rid of Little Vinegar.

641
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,158
I just need to start from this angle.

642
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,239
Lure Yue Yue into harming Little Vinegar.

643
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,039
And then you step up and save the day.

644
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Absolutely.

645
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,959
After all, Erbao is
still part of our family.

646
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,880
How could I bear to let Yue Yue hurt it?

647
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,880
The question is, how are
you going to guide them?

648
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,960
Taking advantage of human nature.

649
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
You want to.

650
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,558
Yue Yue definitely thinks that she.

651
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,936
Already married into a wealthy family.

652
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,880
Can't wait to get rid of this obstacle, Little Vinegar.

653
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,598
All I need to do is
subtly influence things.

654
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,079
Increase the amount of time
she spends with Little Vinegar.

655
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,119
When the time comes.

656
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,240
She definitely won't be able to resist
making a move against Little Vinegar.

657
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
When the time comes.

658
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,239
Chi Cheng has noticed.

659
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,519
He'll kick Yue Yue straight to the curb.

660
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,719
Take it easy.

661
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,000
Let it go, let it go, let it go.

662
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,639
Little Vinegar.

663
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,840
You—what are you doing here?

664
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,119
Sweating this much.

665
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:42,719
Stop wiping.

666
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,200
The more you wipe, the more there is.

667
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,400
There are still people here.

668
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,880
How did you get sand in your eyes?

669
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,799
He's even more embarrassed than you are.

670
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,360
Do you know how many days it's
been since we last saw each other?

671
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,840
Five days, I guess.

672
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,199
A full six days.

673
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,399
This cigarette tastes pretty good.

674
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,520
Did you sell the snake eggs?

675
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,199
Not yet.

676
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
The market's really not doing well lately.

677
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,280
Market prices are way lower than last year.

678
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,440
Don't dare to make a move.

679
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,519
You really know how to
play mind games with me.

680
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,359
You think I don't know what
the market's like this year?

681
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,760
I know you love playing
mind games the most.

682
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,575
Actually, the environment
here is really nice.

683
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,239
Exactly.

684
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
So nice.

685
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,079
Look at how shy the two of them are.

686
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,079
Exactly.

687
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,639
Don't move.

688
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Didn't see that coming.

689
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,280
It's already autumn.

690
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,736
In the blink of an eye, it's
been so long since we broke up.

691
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,640
Back then, I was
desperately trying to hold on.

692
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,439
But now she's with her current boyfriend.

693
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,040
Getting involved in something ambiguous.

694
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,360
This world is truly insane.

695
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,080
Set up a gourmet appreciation
department at the company.

696
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,175
Search for delicious food
from all over the country.

697
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:58,800
Category.

698
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,639
Ranking.

699
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Send it to me.

700
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,639
When do you want it?

701
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Three days
