"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
(Episode 17)

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,920
(If the Hate is Too Deep,
There Can Be No More Love)

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,400
Green-Eyed Monster...

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
is not here.

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Don't catch a cold.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Change out of your wet clothes.

8
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
You...

9
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
What's wrong?

10
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Forget it.

11
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Come in.

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,240
Let's go.

13
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
Mrs. Wu, you don't want
to be hospitalized again.

14
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm fine now.

15
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
- Earlier, I just...
- Lie down first.

16
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,600
got confused because of the pain.

17
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,840
Why don't we tell him?

18
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,120
You can't keep doing this.

19
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,320
Xiao Chi.

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
We can't.

21
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,600
If I die one day,

22
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
Da Qiong will only be sad
for a few days.

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,520
If you tell him now,

24
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,880
he'll have to endure it
until the day I die.

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
I don't want that.

26
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Mrs. Wu.

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,200
Don't say that.

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
How about this?

29
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,800
Stay under observation
for another night.

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,760
If you're fine tomorrow,

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
I'll drive you home in the morning.

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,920
Get some rest first.
I'll make a call.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,960
Thank you.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,600
- No worries, Mrs. Wu.
- Thank you.

36
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Are you home?

37
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Are you about to sleep?

38
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay.

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,360
I have something to do tonight.

40
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
I can't go home.

41
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
By the way,

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
since I'm not around,

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,520
cover yourself well
with the blanket.

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,440
Good night.

45
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
Why don't you go
to Wang Shuo's room...

46
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,440
and get some rest?

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
I don't think so.

48
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,080
If Wang Shuo comes home...

49
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,480
and finds me in his bed,

50
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,520
he won't be happy.

51
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,600
Wang Shuo won't come home.

52
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,200
People who stay out in the rain...

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
won't come home
just because the rain stopped.

54
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Right.

55
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,480
I shouldn't have worried about that.

56
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Wei Wei.

57
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm home.

58
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Where is he?

59
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,960
Where did you go last night?

60
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm asking you
where you went last night!

61
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Wang Shuo's house.

62
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
Was it Wang Shuo...

63
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
or Wang Zhan?

64
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,520
- What do you think?
- Wu Suo Wei.

65
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,080
Search for your conscience
and ask yourself.

66
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,120
How many times
have I put up with this?

67
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,560
You messaged him
and I turned a blind eye to it.

68
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,320
You said you were boxing,
but I saw you having fun.

69
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,200
Now, you even have the guts
to sleep over at his place.

70
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,800
Does my tolerance
mean nothing to you?

71
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Do you think
I'm keeping you as a toy?

72
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,840
Do you have nothing to say now?

73
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
Since you like having fun so much,

74
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
I won't care about you anymore.

75
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Leave!

76
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Why are you here?

77
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,600
Chi Cheng kicked me out...

78
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
of the house.

79
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,760
He favors you so much.
How could he kick you out?

80
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
What?

81
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,800
Did Wang Shuo
become his partner again?

82
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
If you ran away from home,

83
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
you could've just walked
to the front door.

84
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
Why did you come to me?

85
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Da Wei.

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,280
Did you really get kicked out?

87
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,880
Doesn't it prove
that Chi Cheng cares about you?

88
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,360
Last night,
he didn't come home all night.

89
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,400
He must have been out
with Wang Shuo all night.

90
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,840
He even got mad at me.

91
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
It must be
because he's feeling guilty.

92
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
You're right.

93
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
He has long wanted to kick me out,

94
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,040
so that Wang Shuo
could move back in.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
No, wait.

96
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,520
You said Wang Shuo was out
with Chi Cheng all night?

97
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Yes.

98
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,880
He wouldn't even give a reason.

99
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,360
I asked him where he was going
and he said he had something to do.

100
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Wang Shuo was with me yesterday.

101
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
Why did he go to see you?

102
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
He came in the middle of the night.

103
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,640
I couldn't send away
a mentally ill person.

104
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,520
Then where did Chi Cheng go?

105
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I have no right...

106
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,320
to care about that now.

107
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
He once said...

108
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
that when he
doesn't like me anymore,

109
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,320
he'd kick me out immediately.

110
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,320
I didn't expect this day
to come so soon.

111
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,840
I was planning to use Wang Zhen...

112
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,600
to make Chi Cheng jealous.

113
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,000
This turned out to be an excuse
for him to kick me out.

114
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Where are you going to stay
for the next few days then?

115
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,920
Why don't you stay at my place?

116
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,720
I want to go home.

117
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,280
I miss my mom.

118
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Mom.

119
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm home.

120
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Mom.

121
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,040
My dear son.

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,480
How did you find the time
to come home today?

123
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Mom.

124
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Mom, why do I feel like...

125
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,600
you've lost weight again?

126
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,520
At my age,

127
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,600
this is how my illness is.

128
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Mom.

129
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,080
With diabetes,
you must watch your diet.

130
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,480
But you need nutrition too.

131
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Nutrition?

132
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
At my age, we just need to be full.

133
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Mom.

134
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
The older we get,
the more healthy food we need.

135
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,640
It's okay. I'll cook today.

136
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I'll make you good food.

137
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,640
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

138
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,560
Wait for me.

139
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mom.

140
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,360
Who sent these?

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Xiao Chi.

142
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,040
He comes here very often.

143
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,160
Lately, he comes here every day.

144
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,320
He likes my cooking.

145
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,520
Every time, he eats here
before going home.

146
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,040
Look, the ingredients...

147
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,640
doesn't really taste good.

148
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm so not used to its taste.

149
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,560
If he didn't give it
to me out of kindness,

150
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,160
I would have thrown it away.

151
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Mom.

152
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,440
You can't throw it away.
It's a valuable tonic.

153
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Da Qiong.

154
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
Having Xiao Chi as a friend...

155
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
is really...

156
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,200
your blessing.

157
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
It's really...

158
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
better than getting a good wife.

159
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,720
It's because of him...

160
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,280
that I don't have a wife.

161
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,000
He's the one who's useful.

162
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,840
Is there no signal?

163
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,280
Why didn't he message me?

164
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Mom.

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mom.

166
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
What's wrong, Mom?

167
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm fine. Get me some water.

168
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Okay.

169
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
Mom, have some water.

170
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Mom.

171
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
What's wrong?

172
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
It's nothing.

173
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,280
I'm so happy that you're home.

174
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,120
Maybe I ate too much tonight,
so I'm suffering from indigestion.

175
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,080
Mom, you scared me.

176
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,640
I thought you were sick.

177
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,320
- I'm fine.
- Mom.

178
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,520
Let me help you to bed.

179
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Okay.

180
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Da Qiong.

181
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,600
- Lie beside me too.
- Okay.

182
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,080
Chat with me.

183
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Two days ago,

184
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,200
I dreamed of your dad.

185
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,800
In my dream,

186
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,200
he was in the yard,

187
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,440
picking loquats.

188
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
He's still as healthy as ever.

189
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,480
Just like when he was young.

190
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Mom.

191
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
I miss Dad too.

192
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
I really want...

193
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,080
to see your dad soon.

194
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Mom.

195
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
Don't say that.

196
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
You can't curse yourself.

197
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,840
I'm alone in the yard every day.

198
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
It's so boring.

199
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,960
There's no one to talk to.

200
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Mom.

201
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
What if...

202
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,680
I get a loan to buy a house?

203
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
You can move in with me.

204
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,320
That way, I can keep you company.

205
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
It's just that
I have to work every day.

206
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,960
This house is too far from work.

207
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
It's too troublesome to come and go.

208
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,600
Silly boy.

209
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,080
You've only earned some money,

210
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
but you're already showing off.

211
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,520
Save it.

212
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,920
Buy a house when you have the money.

213
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,240
However, even if you buy a house,

214
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
I won't live there.

215
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,960
I can't bear to part
with this place.

216
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
I can't bear to part with your dad.

217
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,680
I've been living here
for over 40 years.

218
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,960
I want to die here.

219
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,440
Now, I am...

220
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,960
just hoping...

221
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,760
you'd get me a daughter-in-law soon.

222
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
Give me a grandson
or a granddaughter.

223
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Yes.

224
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Mom.

225
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
We'll have a big, fat baby...

226
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,400
who's soft to hug.

227
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,880
When he grows up,

228
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,920
he'll run...

229
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,280
around you...

230
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,680
and call you,

231
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,160
"Grandma."

232
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Yes.

233
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm waiting for that.

234
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
You're back.

235
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
So...

236
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
did you miss me?

237
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,760
No.

238
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,560
I almost forgot what you look like.

239
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
You didn't miss me?

240
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,240
Didn't we just have
a video call two days ago?

241
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,320
Do you want me
to help you remember...

242
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,320
how it was back then?

243
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,040
Shut up.

244
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,480
There's something
I want to tell you.

245
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
What is it?

246
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,040
Seven years ago,

247
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,080
before Wang Shuo went abroad,

248
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,120
he had to go to the hospital
almost every few days.

249
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,160
How did you get...

250
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
these medical records?

251
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,080
Don't care about that.

252
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Let me ask you.

253
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,000
Did you know that he's sick?

254
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
No.

255
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,080
It's such a big deal.

256
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,120
How could you not know?

257
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,480
Back then,

258
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,800
I just remembered
they'd always fight and make up.

259
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
Every time they fought,

260
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Chi Cheng would come over
for a drink.

261
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
When I asked him,
he wouldn't tell me anything.

262
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,560
Who knows
what was going on back then?

263
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,160
You're so calculating.

264
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Why didn't you use that?

265
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,120
I became calculating...

266
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,880
because I've been fighting
with Chi Cheng all these years.

267
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,680
Wang Shuo is really something.

268
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,800
Once he left,
you and Chi Cheng matured.

269
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Yes.

270
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
I have to ask Wang Shuo...

271
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
what happened back then.

272
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,520
I wanted to ask him last time,
but I had to go on a business trip.

273
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
I have to ask him clearly this time.

274
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,240
Why are you asking Wang Shuo?

275
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
Weren't you involved?

276
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I...

277
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I…

278
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,520
I drank too much that day.
I was so drunk.

279
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,760
When I woke up the next morning,

280
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,920
Wang Shuo was lying next to me.

281
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,320
I was freaking dumbfounded.

282
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,800
I called Chi Cheng.

283
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,320
He was angry, so he didn't pick up.

284
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,960
A few days later,

285
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,200
Wang Shuo left.

286
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
Even if I wanted to confront him,

287
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,160
I couldn't find him.

288
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
You...

289
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,280
You don't think
that I don't go to Wang Shuo...

290
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,960
because I like Chi Cheng, right?

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,840
Do you have a heart at all?

292
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,720
In that video call two days ago,
you even...

293
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,360
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Young Master Guo.
Please, Young Master Guo.

295
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,320
Go use your calculative mind...

296
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,720
to the fullest.

297
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,760
I've been waiting too long...

298
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,600
for this case to be closed.

299
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Fine.

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,480
I'll close the case for you now.

301
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
All right?

302
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
You and Wu Suo Wei haven't seen
each other for a week or two, right?

303
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,520
He spent the night with someone.

304
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm just ignoring him
for a few days.

305
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
It's not too much.

306
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,560
You didn't teach him a lesson?

307
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,960
If I didn't kick him out,

308
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,840
he'd be lying in the hospital.

309
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
He's getting bolder.

310
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
You need to discipline him.

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,640
He doesn't have the guts.

312
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,080
He just wants to infuriate me.

313
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
This place...

314
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,400
is not far from Wu Suo Wei's
family house, right?

315
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
Why don't we pick him up
along the way?

316
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Forget it.

317
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,640
I didn't dare
to let him go home before.

318
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
Now that he's home,

319
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,720
let him spend time with his mom.

320
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
No, wait.

321
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,240
Why didn't you dare
to let him go home?

322
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Why are you here?

323
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,400
Explain this to me.

324
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,920
What's going on?

325
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
I'm sick.

326
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,680
I woke up late today
and didn't take my medicine.

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,880
I might have an episode
and bite you to death.

328
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
That's enough.

329
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,680
Stop pretending in front of me.

330
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,120
I've shown you enough respect.

331
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,280
You've slandered me
for seven years...

332
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,440
and I didn't say anything.

333
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,080
Stop this.

334
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,560
Why are you so irresponsible?

335
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,520
You're bullying me
because I'm not a woman.

336
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,280
You slept with me,

337
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,320
yet I can't bring a kid
to prove it to you?

338
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,920
That medicine is fake, right?

339
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Stop taking it.

340
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,800
It's messing with your brain.

341
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,600
Since you think
we didn't sleep together back then,

342
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,080
why did you let me
frame you for seven years?

343
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
This is called...

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
going with the flow.

345
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,200
If you didn't leave,

346
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,920
why would Chi Cheng and I...

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,800
stay connected
even after seven years?

348
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,600
There's an idiom that goes...

349
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
"Love breeds hatred".

350
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,040
I want to try
the other way around...

351
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,000
to see if hate...

352
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
can breed love.

353
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You...

354
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,600
You really have a thing
for Chi Cheng.

355
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,440
If I hadn't set you up
to sleep with me back then,

356
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,440
the one who slept with you
would've been Chi Cheng.

357
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
So you admit it.

358
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,800
That you set me up.

359
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,720
Darn it.

360
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,960
I let you trick me again.

361
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
But I'm curious.

362
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,080
What makes you think
I have a thing...

363
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,000
for Chi Cheng?

364
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,320
He was in bed with me,

365
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,200
yet he was calling your name.

366
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,920
That night,
he kept calling "Cheng Yu".

367
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
I wanted to put you...

368
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,600
in a pan...

369
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
and fry you.

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,240
Are you crazy?

371
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,680
He was freaking drunk back then.

372
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,000
Do you believe...

373
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
someone's nonsense when drunk?

374
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,800
Even when he wasn't drunk,
all he could see was you.

375
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's nonsense.

376
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
Because of this ridiculous idea,

377
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,120
you set me up and framed me.

378
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,800
And you've implicated yourself,

379
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,480
yet you don't want
to clean your name.

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,040
Is it worth it?

381
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
You won't understand.

382
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,160
It's very worth it.

383
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Wei Wei.

384
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Why are you here?

385
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,520
I brought Green-Eyed Monster back
to see his dad.

386
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,120
So this is your love nest.

387
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,240
(Always happy with you
all four seasons)

388
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,480
You don't smile much
when you take photos nowadays.

389
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,560
I've never smiled much.

390
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
I remember in our past videos,

391
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
you were smiling
in every single one.

392
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,080
By the way,

393
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,360
a few days ago,
Wu Suo Wei went to my house.

394
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,720
He's a nosy guy.

395
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,160
He touched my computer.

396
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,800
I think...

397
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,040
he saw those videos.

398
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,280
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

399
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Wang Shuo.

400
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,400
What exactly do you want?

401
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,560
To have fun.

402
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,480
Seeing you two fight makes me happy.

403
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Darn you!

404
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Go on.

405
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,720
Don't think there are still
feelings in our relationship...

406
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
by how much I hurt you.

407
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,240
Let me tell you.

408
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,480
I only harbor respect for you now...

409
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,720
in waiting for you for six years.

410
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,640
Listen carefully.

411
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,400
I said six years,

412
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,040
not seven.

413
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
Since last year,

414
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,840
this...

415
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,240
doesn't belong to you anymore.

416
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,720
Do you really
only have respect for me?

417
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
How many six years
does one have in a lifetime?

418
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,480
Including the three years
we were together,

419
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,160
that's 10 years, Chi Cheng.

420
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,920
Let me ask you, Chi Cheng.

421
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Can you remove...

422
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,200
these 10 years...

423
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,640
from your heart completely?

424
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,520
And how many memories do we have...

425
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
in that house in the suburbs?

426
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,600
You lived there for so many years.

427
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,760
To keep our snakes,

428
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,120
you endured the heat of
over 30 degrees Celsius every day.

429
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,360
Can you forget that kind of memory?

430
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
I can't.

431
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
But it's just a scar.

432
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
I can see it,

433
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,240
which can remind me of the past.

434
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,680
But it's just a scar
that remains on my body.

435
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,200
It won't hurt anymore.

436
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,880
They say love breeds hate.

437
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,960
But if the hate is too deep,

438
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,960
there can be no more love.

439
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I'm going to bed.

440
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Let yourself out.

441
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,080
I have one last favor
to ask of you then.

442
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Tell me.

443
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
Right now,

444
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
in front of me,

445
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,400
say you don't love me anymore.

446
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,960
Will you only understand
if I say that out loud?

447
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
I want you to say it yourself.

448
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,720
Once you say it,

449
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
I won't pester you anymore.

450
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Say this.

451
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,000
"I, Chi Cheng,"

452
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,600
"don't love you anymore,"

453
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
"Wang Shuo."

454
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,480
I...

455
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,600
I've been waiting for you.

456
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,080
I've been busy with work
in the past few days.

457
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm staying here
for a couple of days.

458
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
Why don't you stay at Chi Cheng's?

459
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,760
You haven't made up yet?

460
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Milk Tea.

461
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,840
It's been days.

462
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,360
He hasn't sent me a single message.

463
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,120
Who knows where he is?

464
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,640
He must be hanging out
with Wang Shuo...

465
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
and forgot about me.

466
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,520
If he comes to you,

467
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,720
will you go home with him?

468
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,080
Even if he kneels here
and kowtows to me twice,

469
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,120
I won't forgive him.

470
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,440
You have to remember...

471
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,600
what you said today.

472
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,560
Regarding Wang Shuo,

473
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
I asked Cheng Yu for information
a couple of days ago.

474
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
What did he say?

475
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,600
Wang Shuo admitted
that he set this up.

476
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
He and Cheng Yu...

477
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,000
didn't sleep together at all.

478
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,240
What?

479
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
He's sick.

480
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,360
He is indeed.

481
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,560
Wait. People who are sick
in the head don't act like this.

482
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,760
I suspect he had an ulterior motive.

483
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,320
I'm going to find out...

484
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
and let Chi Cheng know.

485
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,600
But we only have
Guo Cheng Yu as the witness.

486
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,360
If Chi Cheng believed him,

487
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
he would have a long time ago.

488
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,320
We need more evidence.

489
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,400
Wang Shuo left so many videos
of the three of them.

490
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,320
He must have other evidence.

491
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm sure I can find it.

492
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,840
Forget it. Have some milk tea.

493
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Tell me.

494
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,360
Wang Shuo has been back
for half a year.

495
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,840
What has he been doing?

496
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,760
Did he just watch you
and Chi Cheng being all lovey-dovey?

497
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
I don't believe he'd do that.

498
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,120
He must be a masochist to like...

499
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,560
seeing the person he loves
with his love rival.

500
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,000
He must have been
secretly scheming...

501
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,440
to get Chi Cheng back.

502
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,040
Then the love rival
he should investigate the most...

503
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,080
is you.

504
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Speaking of which,

505
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,120
he seemed very interested
in my name.

506
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,640
He asked me a few times
why this is my name.

507
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,640
- Your name?
- Yes.

508
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,000
- "Wu Suo Wei"?
- Yes.

509
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,880
- Does he know why I changed it?
- Does he know why you changed it?

510
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,480
That means...

511
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,320
he knows about Yue Yue and me.

512
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,880
Since he knows about it,

513
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,320
why didn't he expose you?

514
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sure
it's not the right time yet.

515
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Da Wei,

516
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,760
will you just go along
with his plan?

517
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,080
At this point,

518
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,640
I have no choice but to do that.

519
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,640
Besides, no one knows...

520
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,960
how things will turn out.

521
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,360
Have a seat first.

522
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
When Mr. Wu is done,
I'll go get him.

523
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Mr. Wu is here.

524
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Mr. Wu.

525
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,920
This is Ms. Yue.

526
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,680
Her company is undergoing renovation
at its new address.

527
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,040
She's here to pick some ready-made
installations and decorations.

528
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Okay.

529
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
It's been a while.

530
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Yes, it's been a while.

531
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,040
You know each other, Mr. Wu?

532
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Yes.

533
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,360
I changed jobs.

534
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm the CEO's secretary.

535
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,320
The company entrusted me
with the renovation.

536
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,560
Since your company
is in this business,

537
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I came to take a look...

538
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
and visit you as well.

539
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Have a seat.

540
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,920
Your timing is perfect.

541
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
How have you been?

542
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
I'm good.

543
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What about you?

544
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,400
Me?

545
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,880
How should I put it?

546
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm okay.

547
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,040
Xiao Lin.

548
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,160
Bring our company's
product brochure...

549
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,280
and let Ms. Yue take a look.

550
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,480
All right. Wait a moment.

551
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
"Ms. Yue"?

552
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,520
I'm not quite used...

553
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,960
to hearing that from you.

554
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,240
After all, we were close.

555
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,320
You deserve to be addressed
with respect.

556
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
They're all here.

557
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,480
Take a look first.

558
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,720
These are the decorations.

559
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,960
Take your pick.

560
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
Tell Xiao Lin if you like anything.

561
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,520
Take it as a gift from me.

562
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,560
I can't accept that.

563
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

564
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Well,

565
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,160
are you still with him?

566
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Ms. Yue.

567
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,280
That's my personal matter.

568
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,920
Don't ask about it.

569
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,440
Xiao Lin.

570
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,880
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

571
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,120
- This is my...
- Mr. Lin.

572
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,000
If I need anything,
I'll make an order based on this.

573
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
- I'll get going.
- The brochure.

574
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
Your bag. You forgot your bag too.

575
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
- Thank you.
- Take care.

576
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,800
Wu Qi Qiong.

577
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,360
I didn't expect you
to be so heartless.

578
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,920
Ms. Yue.

579
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,920
We already have nothing
to do with each other anymore.

580
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,800
Is there anything else
you need, Ms. Yue?

581
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,960
If there's nothing else,

582
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
please leave.

583
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,960
I'll get going then.
I'll visit you again next time.

584
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
This way, please.

585
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,360
Why is she here again?

586
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,520
Her new company's renovating.

587
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,600
She's here to pick out decorations.

588
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,360
Doesn't she know our relationship?

589
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,160
She's purchasing things from you?

590
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,120
Wang Shuo knows about us too.

591
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,320
He comes here to purchase stuff too.

592
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,960
If a love rival makes a purchase,
it's always on the house.

593
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,360
I think she knows about this...

594
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,560
and came to get free stuff.

595
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,920
You're so generous.

596
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Yes.

597
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm generous,
unlike some petty people.

598
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,800
When they're angry,
they don't get in touch for days...

599
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,520
and vehemently criticize
the moment we meet.

600
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,880
They even complain
that I'm generous to my love rivals.

601
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,160
No wonder I've been sneezing
in the past few days.

602
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,320
So you've been scolding me
behind my back.

603
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,000
Could you hear me scolding you
behind your back?

604
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,080
You've probably been fooling around
in the past few days...

605
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,520
that you have forgotten about me.

606
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,840
Who did I fool around with?

607
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Be honest.

608
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Did you miss me in the past 10 days?

609
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
No.

610
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,040
I think Guo Cheng Yu
didn't miss you either.

611
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,560
You're so stubborn.

612
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,800
Do you want to die?

613
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,120
Do you have a death wish?

614
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,640
I'll deal with you when we get home.

615
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,120
A few days ago,

616
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,760
I went to see my mom.

617
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,320
She looked so haggard.

618
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,480
Maybe...

619
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
she has...

620
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,560
been tired lately.

621
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Thank you.

622
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,040
You're always there
to keep her company...

623
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,840
and even eat with her.

624
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,560
Now, you know you should thank me.

625
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
Where was it when you were
being dramatic the other day?

626
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
My mom...

627
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,120
is prone to miscarriages.

628
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,360
When she was pregnant with me,

629
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,720
she already had two miscarriages.

630
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,440
When she had me, she was already 38.

631
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,920
Many of her friends' kids...

632
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,520
bought houses for their moms.

633
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,080
Some of their grandkids...

634
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,920
are already in kindergarten.

635
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,520
I'm just starting my career now.

636
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,160
Sometimes, I really feel
like I don't have enough time.

637
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,920
Now, the company's business...

638
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,600
is on track.

639
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Don't worry.

640
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,720
I can still handle
the company's matters well.

641
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
You...

642
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
should go home more often
and spend more time with your mom.

643
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,440
You've always been...

644
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
so tolerant of me.

645
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,200
What's the matter?

646
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,320
Do you want me...

647
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,960
to be petty with you?

648
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,320
Say what you want to say.

649
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,760
After I finish this cigarette,

650
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,760
you won't get the chance to do so.
