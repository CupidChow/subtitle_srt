(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,639
(Episode 20,
Men are Like Menstruation:)

3
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,176
(You Think About It When It Hasn't
Come, But Annoying When It's Here)

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,576
(The love between the frugal mom
and son is as deep as the sea)

5
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,960
(A great debt of gratitude
for raising me)

6
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,279
(From your nephew, Wang Yu Chun)

7
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,599
(Your good virtue last forever,
always pure in heart)

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,000
(In memory of aunt, from your niece)

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Let's go.

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Stop crying.

11
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
My condolences.

12
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,879
(Offering to the Deceased)

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
I know.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I understand you two.

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm just afraid.

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
I'm afraid that in the future,

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
you'll have a hard time.

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
My condolences.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
Take good care of yourself.

20
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,480
I'll wait for you outside.

21
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,080
(Offering to the Deceased)

22
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
My condolences.

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I'll get going.

24
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Okay.

25
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,000
(From your son, Chi Cheng)

26
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Wang Zhen.

27
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I'll take you home.

28
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,520
This year's loquat harvest
is abundant.

29
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Da Qiong.

30
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,720
How come you're free
to come home today?

31
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
I'll cook for you.

32
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,080
What do you want to eat?

33
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
I've decided.

34
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,520
I'll cook your favorite
braised pork.

35
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
And some sliced potatoes.

36
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,240
(Fortune)

37
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,560
You're an adult now.

38
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
You must learn
to take care of yourself.

39
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Why are you here?

40
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
To laugh at you.

41
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I heard...

42
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
Wang Zhen took Wang Shuo away.

43
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,520
Why aren't you going after him?

44
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,520
I haven't seen you upset enough.

45
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,880
How can I leave with Wang Shuo?

46
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Fine.

47
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Look.

48
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,280
Look all you want in one go.

49
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
Look at how thin you are now.

50
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
You used to be all right.

51
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,280
Now, you don't even look human.

52
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
You know what?

53
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
Seeing you like this now...

54
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,160
makes me feel so good.

55
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Cry.

56
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm here to see you cry today.

57
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,760
The more you cry, the happier I am.

58
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,840
You tricked me.

59
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
You deserve to suffer.

60
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,680
No one would feel bad for you.

61
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,560
(Sugar Figure Blowing)

62
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,000
Stop crying! Do you hear me?

63
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
I told you to stop crying.

64
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Do you hear me?

65
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Wei Wei.

66
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Stop crying.

67
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Don't cry.

68
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
All right.

69
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
That's enough, Wei Wei.

70
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Don't cry.

71
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Be good.

72
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Be good.

73
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Be good.

74
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Don't go.

75
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm not leaving.

76
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
I'll get you some tissues.

77
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,600
Don't go.

78
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Okay.

79
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
I won't go.

80
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm not leaving.

81
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I won't leave.

82
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
Did you wipe your snot
on my clothes?

83
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
I just changed into these clothes.

84
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I don't care.

85
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,520
- I want you to stay with me.
- Okay.

86
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,080
You have to stay with me.

87
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
How about this?

88
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
I'll travel with you
in a couple of days.

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What do you think?

90
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,600
Then why did you...

91
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Why did you come to see me today?

92
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
I want to come whenever I want,

93
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
depending on how long...

94
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,321
I can bear you being away from me.

95
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Then from now on,

96
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,880
don't ever leave me again.

97
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I won't leave you again.

98
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I won't.

99
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I won't leave anymore.

100
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,920
Mom, wash your feet.

101
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Wei Wei.

102
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
Stop watching TV.

103
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm here.
Isn't it enough to look at me?

104
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Let me tell you.

105
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm really good at cooking now.

106
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Look.

107
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
It looks a bit ugly.

108
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,760
But it's still edible.

109
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
You don't like it?

110
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Come on.

111
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,416
I'll take you out
to eat something good.

112
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
What are you doing?

113
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,801
I'll take you out for a good meal.

114
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
My slippers.

115
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Let's go.

116
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
You want to eat loquats?

117
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Yes.

118
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
I'll pick some for you.

119
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Here.

120
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,280
Okay. All right.

121
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
Don't eat it. Eat something else.

122
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Watermelon.

123
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'll give you a piece.

124
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
It's better than that.

125
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
One more piece.

126
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,840
What song did you sing last time?

127
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Let me think.

128
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,680
Do things as simply as you want

129
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,880
It's the philosophy my mom taught me

130
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Mom.

131
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,200
Wei Wei, what's wrong?

132
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm really speechless
with the lyrics.

133
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,520
All right. Come on.

134
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
It's okay.

135
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
All right. I'm here.

136
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,560
Since you like
grocery shopping so much,

137
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
why don't I open one for you?

138
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,200
You have no idea
about the joy of grocery shopping.

139
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,760
We don't have
to eat scrambled eggs tonight.

140
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Wei Wei.

141
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Here.

142
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Try it.

143
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,000
You haven't paid.

144
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
We'll pay outside. Let's go.

145
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
Let's go. I'll take you
to a bigger supermarket.

146
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Mr. Chi.

147
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
You're still here?

148
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Yes.

149
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Come in.

150
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,840
You're still working overtime?
It's so late.

151
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm traveling with Mr. Wu
in a few days.

152
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm trying to catch up with work.

153
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,799
Then I might need to extend
your overtime work...

154
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
for a few more minutes.

155
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
It's okay. Give it to me.

156
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,840
Our tax filing deadline
is coming up.

157
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
The Finance personnel has
something to do today,

158
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,161
so he went home
and asked me to come to you.

159
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Take a look first.

160
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:13,736
If there's no problem,
please sign it.

161
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,120
Finance will file this tomorrow.

162
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
It should be fine.

163
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,976
Have you gone over it with Finance?

164
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I have.

165
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
All right then.

166
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
(Taxpayer: Chi Cheng)

167
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,359
If there's nothing else,
I'll get going then.

168
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,936
- Okay. Thank you.
- I'm just doing my job.

169
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

170
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Wang Shuo...

171
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,520
has been gone for so long.

172
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,600
And he's still hiding
Yue Yue so well.

173
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,720
Until now,
Da Wei still can't find her.

174
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Because...

175
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,720
the one who sent Yue Yue away
after using her...

176
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
wasn't Wang Shuo.

177
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,360
It was me.

178
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Darn.

179
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
It was you?

180
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Do you have to be so surprised?

181
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Gosh.

182
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,640
What are you up to?

183
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,280
Did you let Chi Cheng know,

184
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
then...

185
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,920
make him dump Wu Suo Wei?

186
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,920
You're not aware.

187
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,800
If we don't expose
this matter about Yue Yue,

188
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,600
it'll be a threat to them
sooner or later.

189
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Why don't we take
this opportunity to use her well?

190
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,640
They're both smart people.

191
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
They'll just...

192
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,600
get carried away
with anger for a while.

193
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,960
After some time,

194
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,920
they'll slowly understand.

195
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,440
You old fox. You're the best.

196
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Here.

197
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:55,040
Try the new product...

198
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,320
this old fox just created.

199
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
If you're opening a cake shop,

200
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
it will surely fail.

201
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Eat it.

202
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Okay.

203
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,520
Then I'll just have
to sell my snake farm...

204
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
to make ends meet.

205
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,920
Aren't you going to be
Chi Cheng's backup guy anymore?

206
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,280
What does it have to do with him?

207
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I am...

208
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
doing this...

209
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
to save money for my marriage.

210
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
What an expensive wife.

211
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
Tell me. I'll ask her...

212
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,320
not to marry you
to save you some money.

213
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Of course I must give...

214
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,800
more betrothal gifts.

215
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,440
As long as he's willing to agree,

216
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
it's worth it.

217
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
It's worth it?

218
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,920
That won't make him say yes.

219
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Are you ready?

220
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Wei Wei.

221
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Are you ready?

222
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm ready. Let's go!

223
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Go!

224
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Be careful.

225
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,440
Nice!

226
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,920
- Is it exciting?
- It's so exciting!

227
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,480
- Great!
- Awesome!

228
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
Do you want to have more fun?

229
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Yes!

230
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
Darn you!

231
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,400
Darn you!

232
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,520
Go to hell!

233
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,280
Forget it all!

234
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
Forget all your worries!

235
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,600
Forget them all!

236
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,840
- Fearless!
- Fearless!

237
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,160
- Wu Suo Wei!
- Wu Suo Wei!

238
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,720
It's so pretty!

239
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Are you happy now?

240
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,200
Yes.

241
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Wei Wei.

242
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,560
During our time apart,

243
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
did you miss me?

244
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
No.

245
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
What's wrong?

246
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,440
The last time we had a fight,

247
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,000
we were also apart
for more than 10 days.

248
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's what you said too.

249
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
As you know,

250
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
sometimes,

251
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,640
the truth burns your mouth.

252
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,520
You were hiding something.

253
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,880
Rather than live in fear every day,

254
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,600
I think you should have
just told me.

255
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,760
I haven't even settled
the score with you...

256
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,800
for what you hid from me.

257
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
All right.

258
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
From now on,

259
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,440
let's not dwell on things.

260
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,440
When there's a problem,
let's solve it.

261
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Okay?

262
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
- Okay.
- Come on.

263
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Pinky promise.

264
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

265
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,280
You're so childish.

266
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,960
Look, that's our house.

267
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,560
Our house is over there.

268
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,240
Hello?

269
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,480
Is this Property Management?

270
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,000
There's a power outage at my house.

271
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,880
Hello, I'm sorry.

272
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,976
There's a power outage
in the whole building.

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,456
The circuit
is under emergency repair.

274
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,800
It can only be restored tomorrow.

275
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Hello?

276
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Hey, Cheng Yu.

277
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,976
There's a power outage at my house.

278
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,080
- Can you...
- Yes.

279
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,440
I'll pick you up right away.

280
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
What are you doing?

281
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,720
What now?

282
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,520
Guo Cheng Yu.

283
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Get lost.

284
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Three,

285
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
two...

286
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Why are you still up?

287
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Then...

288
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
What's on your mind?

289
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Don't worry.

290
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I won't try anything.

291
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Go to sleep.

292
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Good night.

293
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Scoot over.

294
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
After traveling,

295
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
you became so old-fashioned
when you came back.

296
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,000
Xiao Shuai is a neat freak.

297
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
How pretentious.

298
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,560
If you're poor like me,

299
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
you can use this too.

300
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
What are you doing?

301
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Pretending to be poor?

302
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Can you believe this?

303
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,280
He only gives me 10 yuan a month.

304
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,320
I can't even afford a lighter.

305
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,280
Don't you have a lighter?

306
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I do have a lighter.

307
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,880
But I can't afford to fill it up.

308
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,776
You can't afford to fill it up?

309
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,520
Jiang Xiao Shuai
was here last night, right?

310
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,080
You didn't do anything again, right?

311
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,719
Who...

312
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Who said so?

313
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,520
Based on what I know about you,

314
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,040
if you succeeded,

315
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,280
he won't be able
to walk out of this room.

316
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,680
Sometimes, knowing too much...

317
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,520
is not a good thing.

318
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
I already wired it.

319
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
(Your account received 50,000 yuan)

320
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There's no need.

321
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,801
It's easy for me to get money
behind his back.

322
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
I like...

323
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
his poor...

324
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
calculating ways.

325
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,600
I just think of it
as coaxing a child.

326
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,960
Your child...

327
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
is quite hard to coax.

328
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Thanks to all of you,

329
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,720
the company is able to achieve...

330
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,440
such amazing results
in a short time.

331
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,040
Especially Lin Yan Rui.

332
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,536
Mr. Lin, thank you
for your hard work.

333
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
No.

334
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:55,256
It's because of the great leadership
from you guys.

335
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,559
I'd like to thank
Mr. Wu and Mr. Chi...

336
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,800
for trusting and guiding me.

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thank you.

338
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,160
Here. I suggest...

339
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,439
let's make a toast
to Mr. Wu and Mr. Chi. Okay?

340
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

341
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Here.

342
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,640
Bottoms up for me.

343
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,256
Let's continue working hard
in the next half of the year.

344
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
- Okay?
- Okay.

345
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
- Keep it up!
- Work hard!

346
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,720
- We can do this!
- Go for it!

347
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,039
Mr. Wu, Mr. Chi, I'll get going.

348
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Bye.

349
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Take care.

350
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,520
Okay. You guys should go too!

351
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
Mr. Wu, you're really rich now.

352
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
When I get rich,

353
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,519
I'll treat you...

354
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,880
to the best spicy hot pot in town.

355
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,080
But Guo Cheng Yu hasn't had it yet.

356
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,720
Guo Cheng Yu?

357
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,880
Hasn't he taken over
the family business?

358
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Darn it.

359
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,520
He hasn't slept with him yet?

360
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
What should we do then?

361
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
How about this?

362
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,079
Ask them out tomorrow.

363
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,680
Let's put on an act
for Jiang Xiao Shuai.

364
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
We'll put on an act,

365
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,520
and Jiang Xiao Shuai
will sleep with him.

366
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Will that work?

367
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Don't worry.

368
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,040
He'll surely thank you.

369
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
Tell him to drink less beer.

370
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,736
- Take his medicine on time.
- Yes.

371
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,160
Okay. I'll get going.

372
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
You're here.

373
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,336
Take this medicine once
every two days.

374
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,040
Take two pills each time
before meals.

375
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,840
Remember to drink less beer
next time.

376
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,560
Don't smoke. Quit it if you can.

377
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Sir.

378
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
What's wrong?

379
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,399
I want to break up...

380
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,520
with Chi Cheng.

381
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Why?

382
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Could it be...

383
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
that love...

384
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
really can't withstand...

385
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,840
the test of time?

386
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
What do you mean?

387
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Do you think...

388
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,560
he's tired of me?

389
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,360
He's so impatient with me.

390
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Da Wei.

391
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Love is...

392
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
a delicate thing.

393
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,256
Sometimes, being hot and cold...

394
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,560
is just a moment's decision.

395
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,160
Every man's androgenic hormone
secretion volume is different.

396
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,120
When you think
he's getting tired of you,

397
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,360
it's actually just
an external symptom...

398
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
of insufficient androgenic hormone
secretion volume.

399
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
It's fine, Da Wei.

400
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Sir.

401
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
You think you're so good.

402
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,399
If I don't show my ultimate move,

403
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,520
it seems like it won't work.

404
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,400
Sir.

405
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,120
If it's really like what you said,

406
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,759
the androgenic hormone secretion...

407
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,440
is too low.

408
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
How did this happen?

409
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Don't look at it.

410
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,240
Did he hurt you?

411
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Sir.

412
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Lower your voice.

413
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
There are other people here.

414
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,159
Last night,

415
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
when I was sleeping,

416
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,880
I accidentally kicked him
in the face,

417
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,480
and he complained that I'm dirty,

418
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,880
so I fought with him.

419
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,840
Then he hit me.

420
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Sir.

421
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,200
As you know,

422
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,240
I can't defeat him.

423
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Darn it!

424
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,800
Who is he to say you're dirty?

425
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,200
We haven't even
held him accountable...

426
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,600
for all the dirty things he did.

427
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,800
I can't believe he did that.

428
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
He...

429
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,080
He often compares me to you too.

430
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
He said I'm not as fit as you.

431
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
He even said...

432
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm not half as reserved as you.

433
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,080
He's just trying to make you angry.

434
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,416
Don't stay at his place anymore.

435
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
Stay at my place.

436
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Let's see what he'll do.

437
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,280
Thank you, Sir.

438
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
He's not worth it.

439
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,640
He's really not worth it.

440
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
All right.

441
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
That's enough.

442
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
It's okay.

443
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
It's all right.

444
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,039
Okay, be good.

445
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,440
Hugs for you.

446
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm suddenly craving
instant noodles.

447
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,080
(Contacts: Chi Cheng, Da Wei,
Guo Cheng Yu, Mr. Li, Qiu Qiu)

448
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
(Guo Cheng Yu)

449
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,400
Lend me your phone to order takeout.

450
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,720
Men are like menstruation.

451
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,480
It's annoying when it comes,

452
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,480
but you think about it
when it doesn't.

453
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Xiao Shuai.

454
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Xiao Shuai.

455
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Xiao Shuai.

456
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
How is it going?

457
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,039
Xiao Shuai hasn't seen Cheng Yu...

458
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
for many days.

459
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,240
He must miss him.

460
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,736
When the time comes,
you have to play along with me.

461
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Do you hear me?

462
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,200
Wait. Your plan is too costly.

463
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Wei Wei.

464
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
I'll give you one more day.

465
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,840
If you can't make it happen,

466
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,840
I'll drug Jiang Xiao Shuai...

467
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
and bring him to Guo Cheng Yu's bed.

468
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
No.

469
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:53,440
One day is too short.

470
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,520
At least three days.
Three days, okay?

471
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,079
Anyway, I can put up
with you being away from me...

472
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,280
for three days at most.

473
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
See what you can do.

474
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Got it.

475
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,800
Da Wei, I need to use the toilet.

476
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,080
Are you in there?

477
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,080
I don't want to live anymore!

478
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Da Wei!

479
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
Da Wei, come out!

480
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Da Wei.

481
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,160
Why are you doing this, Da Wei?

482
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,679
- Da Wei, don't be stupid.
- Chi Cheng.

483
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,199
- You'd better do well,
- He's not worth it,

484
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,320
- or I'll kill you.
- Da Wei.

485
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
Chi Cheng, you bastard!

486
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,000
Do you know Da Wei almost died?

487
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Is he dead?

488
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,800
If he is, would I still come to you?

489
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,519
If he's dead,
I'd get someone to stab you twice...

490
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
and bury you with him!

491
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
How did he die?

492
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Tell me.

493
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,640
He almost drowned.

494
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,240
Did he do it for real...

495
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
and really choked in the water?

496
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,880
You and Guo Cheng Yu
haven't slept together yet, right?

497
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
You know what?

498
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Someone you can't feel...

499
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,360
and touch...

500
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,480
is even more appealing.

501
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,560
I also don't know why...

502
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,520
I want to sleep with everyone
who is with Guo Cheng Yu.

503
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,800
Especially you.

504
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,280
Your appeal...

505
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,880
doesn't just attract Guo Cheng Yu.

506
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,960
You're making me feel tempted too.

507
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Please go and see Wu Suo Wei first.

508
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,080
He's in a really bad mood right now.

509
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Okay.

510
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,280
As long as you tell me to,

511
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm willing to do it.

512
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Let's go, Chi Cheng.

513
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,200
You didn't have to do it
for real, Wei Wei.

514
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,160
Stop freaking crying!

515
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Chi Cheng.

516
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Da Wei.

517
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,920
Why don't you guys talk first?

518
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
I'm going out for a walk.

519
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Stop crying!

520
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:20,040
You don't care even if I cry.

521
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Stand up!

522
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,200
Why are you working so hard?

523
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
I have a cold.

524
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,880
I don't want to infect you.

525
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,560
How did you catch a cold?

526
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,200
I was in the bathtub
for too long yesterday.

527
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,560
You're really asking for trouble.

528
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
For you,

529
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm willing to do anything.

530
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,880
Are you doing this for me?

531
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
You're torturing me.

532
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Da Wei! What's wrong?

533
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,560
Chi Cheng, why did you hit me?

534
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,880
Chi Cheng, I'm going to kill you!

535
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,720
Chi Cheng, let go of him!

536
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,280
Xiao Shuai, don't blame him.

537
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Blame me if you have to.

538
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,160
Chi Cheng is right.

539
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
I'm shameless.

540
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Yes, I'm a simp.

541
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
I deserve to die.

542
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,520
If I had half your reservedness,

543
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
I wouldn't have ended up like this,

544
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Xiao Shuai.

545
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,559
How dare you talk
to Da Wei like that?

546
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Xiao Shuai!

547
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,040
Do you have a death wish?

548
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,920
What did he say that's wrong?

549
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Simp?

550
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,000
Or that he's not reserved enough?

551
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,840
Let me freaking tell you, Chi Cheng.

552
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,560
I'm the shameless one.

553
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm the simp.

554
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,640
I'm not freaking reserved at all!

555
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm going to find Guo Cheng Yu now
and sleep with him!

556
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Xiao Shuai!

557
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Don't go.

558
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,120
Don't let Guo Cheng Yu sleep
with you.

559
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,439
If a man like Guo Cheng Yu gets you,

560
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
he won't cherish you anymore.

561
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,000
Let this be a lesson for you,
Xiao Shuai.

562
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,880
Don't follow in my footsteps!

563
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm going.

564
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,759
I want to see what will happen
after I sleep with Guo Cheng Yu.

565
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,799
- Xiao Shuai!
- Wu Suo Wei.

566
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Don't go.

567
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Let him go.

568
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,440
He doesn't have the guts to do it.

569
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,760
Chi Cheng.

570
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Fine.

571
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Just wait.

572
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,400
Sir!

573
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
He's gone.

574
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
He's finally gone.

575
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
I guess...

576
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,560
I've finished the mission early.

577
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,440
You're a good actor.

578
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Tell me.

579
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,279
Could this be a trap...

580
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,400
your teacher set on purpose?

581
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
No.

582
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:40,096
He doesn't have the brains
to come up with this.

583
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
You're right.

584
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,440
If he finds out,

585
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,720
he won't hold a grudge
against you, right?

586
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,816
Why would he hold
a grudge against me?

587
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Back then,

588
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
if it weren't for him,

589
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:51,200
would I fall into your hands?

590
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,160
This is perfect.
Now, I'll let him have a taste...

591
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,440
of his own medicine.

592
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
At the same time,

593
00:40:57,801 --> 00:40:58,896
we'll let Guo Cheng Yu fix...

594
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,520
his gossiping habit.

595
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,640
- Here.
- Done.

596
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,840
Have you had your fun in acting?

597
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Xiao Shuai.

598
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,280
Let me explain.

599
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
What should I listen to?

600
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
That I don't have a brain
or that I'm a gossip?

601
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Sir!

602
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,840
I'm doomed. It's all over.

603
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,920
All our efforts are in vain.

604
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
No.

605
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Plan B.

606
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Plan B?

607
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Will it work?

608
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Hello?

609
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,560
Cheng Yu!

610
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,159
Chi Cheng and I
originally wanted to make you...

611
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,000
and Xiao Shuai's happy life
even more blissful.

612
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,839
But I think we ruined it.

613
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,160
I'm sorry,

614
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,400
Cheng Yu.

615
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,800
I'm sorry.

616
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Cheng Yu...

617
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Hello?

618
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Cheng Yu.

619
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,920
(Bonus Clip)

620
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,480
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

621
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,680
You're so childish.

622
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,920
Look, that's our house.

623
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,680
Our house is over there.

624
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,760
Why am I always the one
doing this kind of thing?
