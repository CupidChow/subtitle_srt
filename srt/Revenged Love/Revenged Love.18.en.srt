00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,880
(Episode 18, Don't You Know
If I Ever Loved You?)

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,320
Why are you so cute?

4
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,800
What should I name you?

5
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,280
Are you hungry?

6
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,600
Why are you ignoring me?

7
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Hey.

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Where have you been?

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Did you hang out with Wu Suo Wei?

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Ever since I told Chi Cheng...

11
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Wu Suo Wei is at our house,

12
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,600
you two haven't practiced
martial arts at home.

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,440
Did you practice secretly outside?

14
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,760
What is the meaning of this?

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you even my brother?

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
Whether I'm your brother or not,

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,121
does it have anything to do
with my relationship with him?

18
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm angry
because why are you so nice to him?

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,760
After all, he's an outsider.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's also my love rival.

21
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
You can't side with outsiders!

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Or am I...

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,800
the outsider?

24
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Fine.

25
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
You won't speak?

26
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
I'll tell our mom now.

27
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
I'll tell her that her son...

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,976
is guarding
against his own brother...

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,720
in order to help an outsider!

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
In this world, how can...

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Wang Zhen!

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,320
Are you freaking mute?

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,640
Listen. If you don't give me
an explanation today,

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
this matter isn't over!

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Fine.

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,120
Just pretend to be deaf and mute!

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Say something!

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
Don't you guys love boxing?

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm going to destroy everything!

40
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,495
Come on, Green-Eyed Monster.

41
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,855
Don't let your godfather's fumes
smoke you.

42
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:44,895
Come to me.

43
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,373
Why are you here again?

44
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:12,253
It's been a while,

45
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,213
so I came to see you.

46
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:19,493
Thank you for your kindness.

47
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,853
But I'd be more touched...

48
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:23,813
if you create less trouble for me.

49
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,173
You spent the night
at my place the other day.

50
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,253
Did Chi Cheng get mad?

51
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,373
He did.

52
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,213
But his bark is worse than his bite.

53
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:42,453
In the end,

54
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:44,093
he still cares about me.

55
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:51,733
You don't have to analyze
his personality to me.

56
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,653
I know him better than you do.

57
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:05,573
I told him to say
he doesn't love me to my face,

58
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,533
but he couldn't do it.

59
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:15,853
Tell me.

60
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:17,813
How soft-hearted is he?

61
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,733
If I were him,

62
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,052
I wouldn't easily abandon...

63
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,533
someone who sincerely
loves me either.

64
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,853
You're talking about sincerity?

65
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:43,933
Don't associate
the word sincerity with me.

66
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:46,373
After all, a few years ago,

67
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,053
I was the one who just left.

68
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,933
Don't belittle yourself too much.

69
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:55,933
I think...

70
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:58,813
you had your own reasons...

71
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:01,173
for leaving back then.

72
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,093
Continue to help me
clear my name then.

73
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,373
Thank you.

74
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,173
I know you're not a bad person.

75
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,813
You've known about Yue Yue
and me for a long time.

76
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,053
But you didn't tell Chi Cheng.

77
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,293
I guess you're not a fool.

78
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,573
In that case,

79
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,093
as your senior,

80
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,613
let me give you a piece of advice.

81
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,773
Think carefully.

82
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,693
If Chi Cheng...

83
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:35,093
finds out about this,

84
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,093
what will he do?

85
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,493
Mrs. Wu.

86
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,173
Mrs. Wu, I heard you haven't
been feeling well lately,

87
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:23,693
so I especially came to see you.

88
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,493
You are...

89
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,613
I'm Yue Yue.

90
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,349
Before this, I had planned to come
to your house for a meal.

91
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:33,333
But then something came up
and I couldn't make it.

92
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:34,893
I remember now.

93
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,493
Have a seat, Mrs. Wu.

94
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:43,653
Mrs. Wu.

95
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,892
What happened between me
and Wu Qi Qiong before...

96
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,053
was just a misunderstanding.

97
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,453
It's all because we were
too impulsive back then.

98
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:49,893
In the past year,

99
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,333
we've kept in touch.

100
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:52,453
I miss him.

101
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:54,093
He misses me too.

102
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:58,813
Mrs. Wu, to be honest,

103
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:00,733
we both want to get back together.

104
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:03,333
But no one ever brought it up.

105
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,493
He has his pride.

106
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,389
And at that time,
I was the one who broke up with him.

107
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,293
I'm sure he doesn't want
to bring this up first.

108
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,013
But I'm a girl.

109
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:12,973
I'm shy too.

110
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:18,413
Mrs. Wu, please talk
to Da Qiong for me.

111
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,453
I really want to reconcile with him.

112
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:22,853
Well...

113
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,413
- Here!
- Here!

114
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,533
Cheng Yu.

115
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:41,933
Happy birthday.

116
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,493
Happy birthday.

117
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:50,853
At this hour,

118
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,133
why isn't Xiao Shuai here yet?

119
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:54,613
Whether Xiao Shuai...

120
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:55,613
comes or not...

121
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:56,613
isn't important.

122
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,133
What's important is that
it's your birthday.

123
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:01,013
Yes.

124
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,453
And it's our 10th anniversary.

125
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:08,493
Ten years ago,

126
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,733
we confirmed our relationship...

127
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,293
at Cheng Yu's birthday party.

128
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,653
Do you still remember?

129
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:17,293
Tenth anniversary?

130
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,693
You were only together
for a few years.

131
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,333
And there's a huge gap in between.

132
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:25,973
How dare you call it 10 years?

133
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,493
To you,

134
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:29,893
there might be a gap.

135
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:32,453
But to me,

136
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,693
there's none.

137
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:43,973
Ten years.

138
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:47,333
I'll put on a song
to liven up the mood.

139
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,413
Ten years ago

140
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,813
I didn't know you

141
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,493
What are you doing, Wang Zhen?

142
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:05,652
(Wang Zhen:
Are you still coming today?)

143
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:07,934
(Wu Suo Wei: Yes, I just finished
working, be there soon!)

144
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,773
So he can get angry too.

145
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:36,933
He can go crazy.

146
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:38,973
Just...

147
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:40,773
not for me.

148
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:54,253
As you can see,

149
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,693
you're no match for me at all.

150
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:00,093
Chi Cheng still cares about me.

151
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,093
I didn't even use my last trick.

152
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:09,493
Cheng Yu!

153
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,333
What are you doing?

154
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:40,413
Da Wei.

155
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:41,413
Where are you going?

156
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,213
Don't overthink it.
They're just drunk.

157
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:45,653
Don't worry.

158
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,829
A journey of one hundred steps
is half finished at ninety.

159
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:49,493
I'll get to the bottom of this.

160
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:10,893
Guo Cheng Yu.

161
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:12,413
Get up.

162
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:15,933
Get up.

163
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,733
- Come on.
- Come on.

164
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,332
- Two little bees,
- Two little bees,

165
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,932
- flying to the flower shrubs.
- Flying to the flower shrubs.

166
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:22,933
- Flying to the left,
- Flying to the left,

167
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:23,933
- flying to the right.
- Flying to the right.

168
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:24,933
- Fly!
- Fly!

169
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,053
- Fly!
- Fly!

170
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,533
- Fly!
- Fly!

171
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,133
I'll drink.

172
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:33,933
I'll drink. I'm drunk.

173
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,693
You've only drunk a little.

174
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,133
Cheng Yu.

175
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,333
Let's play some more.

176
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,333
- I'll get going.
- Wang Shuo.

177
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:54,733
Darn you.

178
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,253
Why did you kiss him?

179
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:02,613
Hey.

180
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,173
You look quite cute...

181
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,253
when you're drunk.

182
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,053
I'm the one taking care of you.

183
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,413
Cheng Yu.

184
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,693
Cheng Yu.

185
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,533
Come back.

186
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:25,093
Come back.

187
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:27,573
Cheng Yu.

188
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,493
Cheng Yu.

189
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,973
Why did he go
to Guo Cheng Yu's room?

190
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:17,133
What is Wang Shuo doing?

191
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,333
Nothing happened all night.

192
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:49,613
Cheng Yu.

193
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,013
So...

194
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,172
this is all just an act...

195
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,733
by Wang Shuo?

196
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,733
(Wei Wei)

197
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,213
Pick up the phone, Wu Suo Wei.

198
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:01,813
Mrs. Wu.

199
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,773
Did Wu Suo Wei come home yesterday?

200
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:05,933
Xiao Chi.

201
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:06,933
Why are you here?

202
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,653
Well, Da Qiong has been busy
with work in the past few days.

203
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,053
He hasn't been home.

204
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,893
What's wrong? What happened?

205
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,053
It's nothing, Mrs. Wu.

206
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,549
Are you feeling
unwell again, Mrs. Wu?

207
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:23,573
No.

208
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,533
I'm just troubled.

209
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:29,613
Do you remember Da Qiong's
girlfriend of three years...

210
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,133
that I told you about before?

211
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,333
Two days ago,

212
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,253
she came here to see me.

213
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:38,413
Why did she come?

214
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:40,733
She said...

215
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,573
she can't forget Da Qiong.

216
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,053
She wants to reconcile with him.

217
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,053
She also said
they've always been in touch...

218
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,333
since they broke up.

219
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,773
And Da Qiong wants
to get back together with her too.

220
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:53,053
She wants me to help them reconcile.

221
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:54,813
Mrs. Wu.

222
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,933
You said...

223
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,773
they've always been in touch,

224
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:00,493
and they want to reconcile?

225
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:03,293
What's wrong with that girl?

226
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,773
In the past,
she looked down on Da Qiong.

227
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,493
Now that Da Qiong got promoted,

228
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,053
she's back.

229
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,253
Tell me.

230
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,493
Isn't this frustrating?

231
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:18,053
What happened to your hand?

232
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,053
Let me see.

233
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,413
Mrs. Wu, I'm fine.

234
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:22,093
It's just a scratch.

235
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,772
You kids...

236
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,213
should be more careful.

237
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:36,413
Mrs. Wu.

238
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:39,933
Haven't you always wanted
Da Qiong to get a wife?

239
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:41,933
Now that she's come to you,

240
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,173
why are you...

241
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,533
feeling frustrated?

242
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,613
Finding a wife...

243
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,693
can't be rushed, right?

244
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,453
You have to pick a good one.

245
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,013
Not just anyone can do.

246
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,053
Tell me.

247
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,693
Can a girl like Yue Yue be his wife?

248
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,333
How can she break up...

249
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,013
and get back together
with him so easily?

250
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:04,013
She's bullying Da Qiong...

251
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:05,853
for having a good temper.

252
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,733
Yue Yue?

253
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:11,493
Is that a nickname?

254
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:14,093
Her full name is Yue Yue.

255
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:39,693
Wu Suo Wei.

256
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:42,893
Wu Suo Wei!

257
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,053
Maybe they have the same name.

258
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,253
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

259
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:24,613
(Bait Plan)

260
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:33,573
(Earn big from Chi Cheng)

261
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:40,453
(Chi Cheng, 28,
rich heir, loves keeping snakes)

262
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:46,373
(Goal: Break them up!)

263
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:53,693
(Goal: Break them up!)

264
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:01,173
What an act.

265
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,493
He's even in my dream.

266
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:05,493
What act?

267
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,893
I feel guilty.

268
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:15,813
Why is she here?

269
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:19,053
I should...

270
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:20,253
ask you that.

271
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,133
I had an ulterior motive...

272
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,813
when I approached you back then.

273
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,213
You knew I had a girlfriend
for three years?

274
00:24:28,373 --> 00:24:29,373
Do you know who she is?

275
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,133
Back then, me and Yue...

276
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:34,613
Yue what?

277
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,053
I...

278
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,613
I...

279
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,373
I'm starting to think
you're frivolous.

280
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:45,253
Why is she here again?

281
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:47,349
Her new company
is undergoing renovation.

282
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:48,452
After they broke up,

283
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,613
they've always been in touch.

284
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:52,173
And Da Qiong wants
to get back together with her too.

285
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:06,853
(Ice cream, second one is half off!)

286
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,133
You're still here?

287
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,333
- Hello?
- Da Wei.

288
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,589
Chi Cheng came
to the clinic just now.

289
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:40,932
He even took out your box.

290
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:41,933
Okay.

291
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:43,773
I got it.

292
00:25:58,213 --> 00:25:59,213
After this,

293
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,733
it's over for good.

294
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,333
What is this?

295
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:21,133
Can you explain it to me?

296
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:24,213
Haven't you...

297
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,133
already seen it?

298
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:29,893
What did I see?

299
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:31,173
You saw...

300
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,653
my true intention...

301
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:36,093
in approaching you.

302
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:42,853
So...

303
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:46,333
you've always been
in contact with her?

304
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,694
Even after you broke up,
you've been thinking about her...

305
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,693
and want to reconcile?

306
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,573
Think whatever you want.

307
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:13,653
Wu Suo Wei.

308
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:18,092
I don't care...

309
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:19,533
what your original intention was.

310
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,453
We've been together for so long.

311
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:28,172
You must have been...

312
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,933
at least a little sincere to me.

313
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:42,813
As long as you say yes,

314
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:47,813
I'll let bygones be bygones.

315
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,613
No.

316
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:13,413
I dated you...

317
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:16,773
just to get revenge
on you and Yue Yue.

318
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,533
Now,

319
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:23,173
I want to use your ways
to make money.

320
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,933
Once I'm rich enough...

321
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,133
to fulfill Yue Yue's requests,

322
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,253
I'll get back together with her.

323
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:33,733
I'm straight.

324
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:37,853
Why should I be with you forever?

325
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:50,013
Wu Suo Wei.

326
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:01,653
You win.

327
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,653
You're making me wish I were dead.

328
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,333
You're really good.

329
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:16,493
I accept my defeat.

330
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,733
I deserve it.

331
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,293
I brought this upon myself!

332
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:25,733
You wish you were dead?

333
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:28,413
Have you ever loved me?

334
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:31,333
Ask yourself.

335
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:32,973
Are these words...

336
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:35,853
appropriate to use on me?

337
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:38,693
Yes.

338
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,533
I've never loved you.

339
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:46,052
You slept over
at someone else's house,

340
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,213
and I didn't fight with you.

341
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,412
You flirted right under my nose,

342
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:52,693
and I didn't even go off on you.

343
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,213
Just scolding you
made me suffer for days.

344
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:59,613
I'd rather kick you out
than yell at you.

345
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:05,013
How is that love?

346
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:07,893
Right?

347
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:16,533
You think I love him,
and I don't love you.

348
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,093
You think I'm too good to you.

349
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,213
It's not enough to prove
how much I love you.

350
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,533
Fine.

351
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,413
From now on,

352
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,333
I'll change.

353
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,613
I'll be good to him.

354
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:45,133
Let's never meet again.

355
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,133
Let's never get in touch.

356
00:31:55,053 --> 00:31:56,053
Okay.

357
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,053
Fine.

358
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:10,093
(Chi Cheng)

359
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,013
This is the evidence
I found for you.

360
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,333
Seven years ago,

361
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,533
Wang Shuo and Guo Cheng Yu...

362
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,773
didn't have sex.

363
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:26,173
Congratulations.

364
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,493
Your issue is resolved.

365
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:33,893
Now, you can get
back together with him.

366
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,133
I'm so happy.

367
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,053
I'm so happy
that I don't know what to say.

368
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:52,733
Wu Suo Wei.

369
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:57,693
Thank you.

370
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:01,093
Thank you for being so good to me.

371
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,333
Thank you for paving the way for us.

372
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,253
This is the end for us.

373
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:47,773
Don't you know...

374
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:51,453
whether I love you or not?

375
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:28,533
Chi Cheng.

376
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:32,573
Why are you here?

377
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:40,293
Wu Suo Wei...

378
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,133
showed me your video back then.

379
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,533
Even if I waited for seven years,

380
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,493
you're finally here.

381
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,493
Do you still remember...

382
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,213
the pattern on his forehead...

383
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:15,653
when I gave it to you?

384
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:19,733
It's heart-shaped.

385
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:21,773
Nice.

386
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,373
You have a good memory.

387
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:37,093
I still prefer
seeing you like this now.

388
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:40,133
Why must a simple person...

389
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:41,813
think too much?

390
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:43,653
It's all because
I was so mad at you.

391
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:47,333
From now on, be this way.

392
00:37:49,813 --> 00:37:50,813
Stop dwelling on things.

393
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:53,413
Who's to blame for that?

394
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:55,133
It's all your fault.

395
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,293
Then from now on,

396
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:02,973
don't change this attitude.

397
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,133
What attitude?

398
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,573
I owe you this line.

399
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,773
Wang Shuo.

400
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,533
I don't love you anymore.

401
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:53,213
After watching
the video Wu Suo Wei sent me,

402
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:56,053
I realized...

403
00:38:57,693 --> 00:38:59,853
I've long lost any feelings for you
in my heart.

404
00:39:03,813 --> 00:39:05,613
All these years,
I've been struggling...

405
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,693
because I didn't know the answer.

406
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,293
When Wu Suo Wei gave me the answer,

407
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,293
I became even more certain...

408
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,213
that I don't love you anymore.

409
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:25,893
Chi Cheng.

410
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,133
You're so cruel.

411
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:41,173
Didn't you ask me before...

412
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:46,573
why I only care about you
being gone for seven years,

413
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:48,853
but never asked...

414
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,533
about what you did
with Guo Cheng Yu?

415
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,333
I'll give you an answer now.

416
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:04,853
Because what really hurt me...

417
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,532
was your decisiveness,

418
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,893
not your betrayal.

419
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,293
I hate you
for never explaining things to me.

420
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,853
You were gone for seven years,

421
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:27,973
and there was never
a crack in my heart.

422
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:32,813
In the three years we dated...

423
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,173
and the six years after you left,

424
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:41,733
my heart was completely yours.

425
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:45,893
It was you who didn't protect it.

426
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:51,333
Now it's gone.

427
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:55,173
It's completely Wu Suo Wei's.

428
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:05,453
Stop it.

429
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,333
Wang Shuo.

430
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:29,413
I'll get going.

431
00:41:42,373 --> 00:41:44,293
I'm returning
Green-Eyed Monster to you.

432
00:41:48,013 --> 00:41:49,013
Take good care of him.

433
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:01,173
- Hello?
- Hello?

434
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:03,813
Hi, are you Wu Qi Qiong?

435
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:05,973
Yes.

436
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:08,653
Do you know Ms. Zhang Li Ya?

437
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,773
Her emergency contact
is not answering his phone.

438
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:13,613
We found your number
in her recent call history.

439
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:15,893
She's my mom.

440
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:16,933
What happened to her?

441
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:17,973
She fainted at home.

442
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,452
A neighbor called for an ambulance.

443
00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:21,212
She's at the hospital now.
She's in critical condition.

444
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:22,493
You should come to the hospital.

445
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:23,573
Okay.
