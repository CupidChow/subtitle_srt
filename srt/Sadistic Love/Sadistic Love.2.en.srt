Madam,

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,000
the governor asked you

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,980
to hold the candles at the wedding night,

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,520
burning until dawn.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,720
Hello?

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
I shouldn't disturb

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,280
your wedding night.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,240
I just heard you've been looking for me.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,280
Did my people not

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,720
explain clearly?

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,000
You solved the robbery case at one stroke.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How impressive!

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
You sent people to watch them.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,480
Because you were requested

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,440
to find their hideouts.

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
By chance,

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,880
I caught these people.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
In a way,

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,600

153
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,480
I almost forget

154
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,320
He Molin is my stepfather.

155
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,360
He drove my mother to death

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,760

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,000
That's not the case.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,340
I've already explained it to you.

159
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,990
Your mother committed suicide back then.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,390
It has nothing to do with my father.

161
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,600
She died at your home. You can't escape.

163
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
sees us end up like this,

165
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,760
what would he do?

166
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Let me go.

167
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,560
Let go.

168
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
It's fine you don't sign the paper.

169
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,560
Choose an execution device for your father.

170
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840

172
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,280
how much longer he can hold on.

173
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,880
So,

You married me just to get revenge, right?

177
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

178
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
