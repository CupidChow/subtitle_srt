Breaking News!

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,200
Zhao Zhiqian colluded with bandits,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,040
harmed innocent people, truly a villain.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,960
Helian Zheng uncovered his plot,

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,220
eliminating him for the people,

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
and reinstated
as the governor of Luan City.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,620
(Tomb of Virtuous Brother Mo Yutang)

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,300
(Erected by his sworn brother, Helian Zheng)

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
Tang,

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,200
since you left,

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,520
no one drinks with me anymore.

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,500
(Tomb of Virtuous Brother Mo Yutang)

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
The world now knows
Zhao Zhiqian's true face,

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
but those he wronged

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,780
still live in fear of his shadow.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
Rest assured.

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,720
I will take good care of them.

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,220
(Tomb of Virtuous Brother Mo Yutang)

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,640
(I sorted through your belongings.)

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,320
(Didn't expect you to keep these shoes.)

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,320
(I will visit you often.)

36
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
(This time, no matter what happens,)

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
(I won't break my promise.)

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,120
(You will always be my only brother.)

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
You went to see him.

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,280
Will you blame me?

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,820
Cherishing those still alive

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,060
and living each day to the fullest

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,760
are what matters the most.

44
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
Luckily, you're here.

(Wen Hsin Gallery)

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Anran,

47
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,080
in front of me,

48
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,160
you can be unreasonable.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
Because I, Helian Zheng,

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,600
am your most loyal knight.

51
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
Sometimes I wonder,

52
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,520
how wonderful it would be

53
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
if there's only
the two of us in this world,

54
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,320
I'd tease you until you couldn't even cry.

55
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,680
I've decided

56
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,260
that you're the only certainty

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
in the surprises in my life.

58
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,760
He Anran,

59
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
will you

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,880
marry me again?

61
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
I do.

62
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Honey.

63
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
I've made up my mind.

64
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,600
Wherever you are, I'll be there.

65
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
If you want to stay here,

66
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,440
then I'll stay here too.

67
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,660
What about your work?

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
Since you helped me manage the work,

69
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
peace has prevailed in the city.

70
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,000
And the people live happily.

71
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
I might retire early.

72
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,720
I wish every day were like our wedding night.

73
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,880
He Anran,

74
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
starting today,

75
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
your eyes,

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
your heart,

77
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,480
and your words

78
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
should belong to me alone.

79
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
He Anran,

80
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
do you agree?

81
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
I do.

82
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Why are you all here?

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
It's your governor.

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
He said a proposal needs witnesses.

85
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,280
I told you, I'm always available.

86
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,080
I listen to my wife.

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,880
Whatever my wife says goes.

88
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,880
You guys...

89
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
Three months.

90
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Congratulations!

91
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Honey,

92
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
we've been having fun every night.

93
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
But I don't see any signs of a baby.

94
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
See that?

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
How do you know there isn't?

96
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm pregnant.

97
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Really?

98
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm going to be a father!

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Really.

100
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,880
- Congrats!
- Congrats!

101
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,800
- Really?
- Really.

102
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,560
Double the joy.

103
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
But apologies, Governor.

104
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,040
I got ahead of you this time.

105
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
No problem.

106
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,140
