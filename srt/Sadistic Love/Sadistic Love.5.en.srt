14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,440
Madam, this letter is from the He Family.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
Where is the governor?

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,680
The house is so empty today.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,520
Why are you the only servant here?

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,160
Whenever it's gloomy and rainy,

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,320
the governor gets headaches.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,660
So the governor has set rules.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,100
When it's gloomy and raining,

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,440
he asks everyone to leave.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,240
Even Lieutenant Li was driven away.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,440
I see.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
You can leave.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,940
(Chu Ming'an)
Anran,

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,180
I've completed my studies early

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,160
and will return home on the 22nd.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Are you okay?

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,280
What is this?

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,290
Nothing.

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,840
It's just a letter Yun sent.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,040
You've already married me.

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,240
You're still in touch with Chu Ming'an, huh?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
No.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,560
Let me explain.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Ming'an will return to the country.

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,860
- He just...
- It's been five years.

39
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,920
You still can't forget him.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
You still love him, right?

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
I don't.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
Ming'an is just...

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,920
Let me go!

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,480
What are you doing?

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Let me go!

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,880
Let me go!

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,280
Why are you hiding?

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,920
Because I'm not Chu Ming'an, right?

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
No.

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
Can you calm down first?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
We...

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
Let me go.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,040
You're crazy.

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
I'm just crazy.

55
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Five years ago,

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,160
I was just a poor kid.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
I wasn't good enough for you.

58
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
Five years later, I become the governor.

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,120
Am I still unworthy of you?

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
I didn't...

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
I know.

62
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,720
You want to be with him.

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,040
No, it's not that.

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm here to shatter your illusion.

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,760
Let go of me first.

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
Let go of me.

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,440
Didn't you say

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,000
you'll repay the He Family's debt?

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,920
Then repay it properly.

70
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,990
(These past five years,)

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
(I've always dreamed of that rainy night.)

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,800
(Look

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,040
(at how I abandoned my love back then.)

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Anran,

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm really happy

76
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,100
that you accept my proposal.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,020
(Five years ago)
Mr. He,

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
please rest assured.

79
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,460
I'll take good care of her.

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
Let her go.

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
- Brother...
- Anran, don't be afraid.

82
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll protect you.

83
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
He Zheng.

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,360
Let go of your sister's hand.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
He Molin,

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
you killed my mother first

87
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,950
and now you're forcing Anran

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,280
to marry someone she doesn't love.

89
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,520
You jerk.

90
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,880
Brother... Father.

91
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
Your mother committed suicide.

92
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
Don't slander me.

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,960
You're not qualified

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
to interfere your sister's wedding.

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,000
You should know who you are.

96
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,720
You two can only be siblings.

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,040
There's absolutely no chance.

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Somebody!

99
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,200
Take this rebellious child out and beat him.

100
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
- Yes.
- Let me go.

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Let go of Anran.

102
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
Brother...

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,580
- Let go of Anran.
- Brother...

104
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
- Brother!
- Anran!

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Let me go.

106
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Brother.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Anran!

108
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,870
Be good.

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
- Anran!
- Father...

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Anran!

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,920
Father, please stop.

112
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
Father, this may kill him.

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,200
Because of you,

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,880
our family's reputation is ruined.

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,320
Beat him!

116
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
Brother...

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,440
Anran...

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
(Anran,)

119
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
(I fell in love with you
five years ago.)

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
(I knew this was all so ridiculous.)

121
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,480
(But now,)

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,560
(I still want to act recklessly again.)

123
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,880
(One more time.)

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
(That's all.)

125
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
Anran...

126
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,280
Anran...

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,640
Don't marry him.

128
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,280
Go with me.

129
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
He Zheng,

130
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,720
why do you think I'll go with you?

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,320
I've had enough of our action.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are just a little toy

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,490
I use to pass the time when I'm bored.

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,200
Only Ming'an

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,280
can be with me.

136
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
What are you saying?

137
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
I don't believe it.

138
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
I don't believe it.

139
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,080
Don't you understand?

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,280
He Zheng,

141
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
Anran and I are already engaged.

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,920
Hope you won't interfere with us.

143
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,440
You're talking nonsense.

144
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,800
You said

145
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
you'd always be with me.

146
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,890
You also promised to help me find my brother.

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,640
You're still wearing

148
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,760
the butterfly necklace I gave you.

149
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
This one?

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,720
A very cheap trinket.

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
I'm still ashamed to wear this.

152
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,960
He Zheng,

153
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
you can only be my brother.

154
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,860
You don't deserve any other title.

155
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,200
If you can keep being a good brother,

156
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,440
maybe the He Family will spare your life.

157
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,780
If you're pushing your luck,

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,720
it will leave you with nothing.
