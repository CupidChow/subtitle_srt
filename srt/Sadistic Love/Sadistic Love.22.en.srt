Let me go!

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,920
Stop playing games.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,240
Let me go.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,360
Let me go.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,440
Let me go.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,840
Behave yourself.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,120
Tang.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,320
Let Anran go.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
Take it out on me.

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,360
What?

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,560
Feeling miserable now?

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,640
Is it painful?

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,120
What about me?

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,520
My leg

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,160
was ruined because of you.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,280
The moment you entered the He's Mansion,

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,240
was the beginning of my suffering.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,680
So it turns out

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,080
you've always resented me.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,520
Our reunion as brothers,

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
to you,

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,560
was just a façade of brotherly love.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
But to me,

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
it was the time I cherished most.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
Tang,

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
I don't want to lose you as my brother.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,600
If there's anything...

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,200
I will repay it.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
Repay?

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
How will you repay?

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,680
Can you endure my pain once?

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
When I lived in torment,

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,760
what were you doing?

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,520
You were romancing He Anran,

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
enjoying life.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Helian Zheng.

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
You aren't worthy to repay me.

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,360
Tang.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,760
Do you know what this means?

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,600
This ring represents honor,

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,760
and the mark it leaves

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,480
symbolizes a trophy.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,680
Your dear brother and your mother

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,480
weren't just my pawns.

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,920
The night Zhao Zhiqian humiliated me,

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,880
are you willing to bear it for me?

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,480
All of my pain

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,240
is because of you.

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,760
If I hadn't gone looking for you...

63
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Who is there?

64
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
Don't come any closer!

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,960
Don't come over!

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,920
Stay back!

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,760
What?

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
You saw everything.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I'll tell my brother,

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,960
you're the one who killed his mother.

71
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,280
Stay back!

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,120
Has anyone ever told you

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,120
that when you can't fight back,

74
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,400
you'd better keep quiet?

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't!

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
You do have

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
- a face prettier than any actor's.
- Let me go!

78
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,920
No!

79
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,840
I don't want this!

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,080
Just because I care
and cherish the bond

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,120
we share as brothers more than you do,

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,440
I deserve to endure all this pain?

83
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,280
Now you understand the meaning of this mark.

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,840
Your mother and I...

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,560
We weren't just his pawns.

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,200
We were also his playthings.

87
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,560
And all of this...

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
It happened because of you!

89
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,440
Helian Zheng!

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,720
Tang.

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,800
Zhao Zhiqian.

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Did he truly...

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,000
Shut up!

94
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,120
But even so,

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,360
I still went to find you the next day.

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,400
Guess what I saw.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,240
I saw you

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,280
using the money you earned
through hard labor

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
to buy a necklace

100
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,520
and gave it to that heiress.

101
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,920
So you worked at the docks daily

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
to earn money to buy this?

103
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,760
I heard working there is dangerous.

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,240
You must have gone through a lot.

105
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Why are you so foolish?

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,520
Anything you want,

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll get it for you.

108
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
Brother!

109
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,560
You filthy beggar!

110
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,040
How dare you sneak into He's Mansion!

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
I am not a beggar.

112
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm here to see my brother.

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
Your brother?

114
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,160
Coming here to see your brother?

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,040
Looks like you're looking for death.

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
Break his legs.

117
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,720
See if he dares to come back for his brother.

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Dirty beggar!

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,360
Don't let me see you again.

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,560
That was the same day

121
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
I was beaten by the He Family servants.

122
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,560
Since then,
my life plunged into darkness.

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,760
Helian Zheng!

124
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,640
Why did you abandon me again?

125
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,800
I have no home anymore.

126
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
Zheng.

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
How can you

128
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,080
live a life as if you're guiltless?

129
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,000
Tang.

130
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,440
Helian Zheng.

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,960
When I needed you the most,

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,240
where were you?

133
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,200
This isn't what I wanted.

134
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,640
Tang.

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
I've been searching for you.

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,040
I told you,

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,120
I would take you away.

138
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,120
Enough!

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,960
I'm tired of this.

140
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,400
Let's make it simple.

141
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
Make your choice.

142
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Kill me,

143
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
or trade your life for hers.

144
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
I won't kill you.

145
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,440
You've become like this,

146
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,320
and I share the blame.

147
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,400
Let Anran go, and take my life instead.

148
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,600
Just promise to tell her to live well

149
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,800
and tell her

150
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,840
I love her.

151
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
You think one shot can end it all?

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,800
It's not that easy.

153
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,920
There are no bullets in the gun.

154
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
I want you to see

155
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
how I become a demon

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,200
and how I destroy the person
you cherish most.

157
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Tang.

158
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
You've killed too many people.

159
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,680
It's time to stop.

160
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,560
I'll repay

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,760
all the debts.

162
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,520
From the day you left me behind,

163
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,520
it has all been too late.

164
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
Do you know?

165
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,320
I've been doing dirty assassination work.

166
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,480
I've taken the lives of 294 people in total.

167
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,440
Since the day we parted ways,

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,560
1,941 days have passed.

169
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,360
And every single one of those days

170
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,080
has been pure torment for me.

171
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,000
It's all so painful.

172
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,560
But every time I take a life,

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
I can feel

174
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,760
incredible pleasure.

175
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,640
Now,

176
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,040
I want you and He Anran
to accompany me in death.
