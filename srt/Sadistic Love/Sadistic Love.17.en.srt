climbing into the backyard,

165
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
and heading straight to Master's study.

166
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,400
At first, I wanted to call for help.

167
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,200
But then I realized

168
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
it was Mr. Helian.

169
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,240
Impossible.

170
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,120
It can't be.

171
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,480
Where is the governor?

172
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,480
The governor went out this morning,

173
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,760
and hasn't returned since.

174
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,440
Even Lieutenant Li doesn't know.

175
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,280
The governor went out this morning.

176
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,000
Even Lieutenant Li doesn't know.

177

But then I realized

178
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,680
