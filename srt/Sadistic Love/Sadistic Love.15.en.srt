Aren't we going to talk about business?

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,600
What kind of skill is kidnapping orphans?

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
Anran?

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,440
I've long heard of your heroic deeds.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
I heard you and your sister

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,320
had a dramatic forced marriage.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,880
You truly adore her, huh?

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
What do you want?

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,280
I captured these orphans,

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,360
but it's not enough to negotiate with you.

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
So,

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
I brought Anran here too.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,960
You and your band of misfits

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
dare to stir up troubles in Luan City.

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,320
It'll cost your life.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,190

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,240
It's truly touching.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
It makes one ponder

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
how important your sister is, no,

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,720
your wife,

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,400
in your heart?

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,080
Governor, make your choice.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,840
Continue to be the hero of Luan City

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
to save these orphans.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Or...

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,520
save this little beauty,

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
and give up these lives.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Miss,

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,000
why don't you say something?

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
Helian Zheng, save the orphans.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Don't worry about me.

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,560
Even if I survive,

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll live with guilt forever.

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,360
(Their target is the gold mine.)

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,220
(Anran won't be harmed for now.)

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,760
I choose the orphans.

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Alright.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,200
What about your men?

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
Lieutenant Li.

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,440
Escort the orphans out.

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,540
Governor.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Don't enter without my orders.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Good.

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Let them go.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
Get up.

63
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Hurry up, leave.

64
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,380
Move faster.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
This way.

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,400
- Over here.
- Hurry.

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,040
Retreat.

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,160
I know you want the gold mine.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
I have the key to it.

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
I'll trade my life

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,480
for hers.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,440
No.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
You are indeed sincere.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Go ahead.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,910
Zheng.

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,200
Go, forget about me.

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
Go, Zheng!

80
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,120
- Shut up.
- Just go.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Helian Zheng.

82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Helian Zheng, you need to go!

83
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,800
- Go now!
- Let her go.

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,640
Helian Zheng, leave now!

85
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Get lost!

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,280
Do you really think

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,760
you're the big hero of Luan City?

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
Let me tell you,

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
I actually look down on you.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,480
In my heart,

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,440
you're just a poor man.

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,200
I've never...

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,480
I've always seen you as a brother.

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,600
Go quickly, forget about me.

95
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,880
Hurry up and leave.

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,760
Don't waste time on me.

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,960
Why are you being so foolish?

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
It's really not worth it for me.

99
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
Go, please!

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,560

I'm fine, don't worry.

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
