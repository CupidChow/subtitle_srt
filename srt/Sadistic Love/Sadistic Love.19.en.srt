Tang.

42
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,200
Zheng.

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,920
This is no longer your home.

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,360
Come with me.

45
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Governor.

46
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,800
Yun and her brother, who she relied on,

47
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,720
have gone missing.

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
The clue has dried up.

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
(Do you remember that winter?)

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,960
(You gave me your coat)

51
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
(and caught a fever for days.)

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
(Later, the cold invaded.)

53
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
(It left a lasting ailment.)

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,080
(How about I end it with this jab?)

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,400
(If you die, everything resolves.)

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
Anran, Anran.

57
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,720
Zheng, are you feeling better?

58
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Tang.

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,240
Tang.

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,800
Thanks to you.

61
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,160
No need to say thanks between us.

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,900
Your gunshot wound hasn't healed,

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,240
and now you've got a knife wound.

64
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,800
You really need to be careful.

65
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
Tang,

66
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,400
I've already got a lead.

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
No need to rush.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
It's still raining outside.

69
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
If your wound opens up again,

70
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,460
won't that delay
catching the killer even more?

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,680
Wait till tomorrow.

72
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,640
But I can't stop worrying about Anran.

73
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
Zheng.

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,400
Be sensible.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,440
Drink the medicine first.

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,720
(I didn't wear any perfume.)

77
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
(Why is there a special fragrance?)

78
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
(It's coming from this button.)

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,880
(How strange.)

80
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
(This scent feels so familiar.)

81
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,520
Miss, this is White Blossom Balm.

82
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a specialty in my hometown.

83
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
It smells nice.

84
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,480
So fragrant, isn't it?

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,600
I'll give it to you.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,400
It's the scent of White Blossom Balm scent.

87
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
Could it be Yun?

88
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,840
Breaking news!

89
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,760
A pair of siblings were found drowned,

90
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,480
suspected to be He's Mansion servants

91
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,560
killed by enemies.

92
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,120
Breaking news!

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
Give me a paper.

94
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Sure thing, miss.

95
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,720
(Wen Hsin Gallery)

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,420
(Luan Daily)
Here you go.

97
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,100
(A Murder Occurred in Luan City Last Night)

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
Breaking news!

99
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,120
It really is Yun.

100
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
A pair of siblings were found drowned,

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,080
suspected to be He's Mansion servants

102
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,120
- They killed both siblings.
- killed by enemies.

103
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
This is not Helian Zheng's doing.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,280
Now that Yun is dead,

105
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,040
Helian Zheng is in greater danger.

106
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,120
Brother-in-law,

107
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
are you alright?

108
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,920
He's my brother-in-law.

109
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Five years ago,

110
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,800
he examined Concubine Liang's body.

111
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
After Mr. He

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,840
having me replicate the merit ring,

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
he kept urging me to meet with him.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,720
Later, he passed away,

115
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,920
and that's when my brother-in-law
started to hide.

116
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,880
You'd better tell the truth.

117
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,400
Was He Molin's death

118
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,160
related to what happened five years ago?

119
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,080
I... I...

120
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,160
I don't know.

121
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
I truly don't know.

122
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,280
Lieutenant Li.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
Take him away

124
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,440
and keep him safe.

125
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,400
Not a single hair should be harmed.

126
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,800
Understood.

127
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,360
I don't know.

128
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,560
Let me go.

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
I really don't know.

130
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law!

131
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,560
The orphanage director and He Molin

132
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,840
were also killed by you, right?

133
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
You used a gun to force He Molin

134
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,240
to meet me by the mountain.

135
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,480
Yun framed me with the button,

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
because you threatened her brother, right?

137
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,040
That's right.

138
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,760
It's just a pity

139
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
that you still managed to escape.

140
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,200
Helian Zheng.

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
You killed so many of my fellows.

142
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Even if I can't avenge them today,

143
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
my other fellows will definitely kill you.

144
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
He hid poison in his mouth.

145
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,920
Looks like he's prepared to die.

146
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,080
Governor,

147
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,480
the coroner has been settled.

148
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,760
He's a bit mentally unstable now.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,640
But we've arranged a doctor to treat him.

150
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,640
How is Anran doing?

151
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,440
She...

152
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,200
Yun stole the button.

153
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,040
Anran.

154
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,120
Why are you here?

155
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
How's your injury?

156
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Just minor wounds.

157
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,360
Not a big deal.

158
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,000
Yun must have been coerced

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,160
to betray the He Family.

160
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,880
Now, both she and her brother
have been killed.

161
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm even more certain

162
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
you can't be the one who killed my father.

163
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,400
I shouldn't have doubted you.

165
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,160
Anran,

166
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,280
this isn't your fault.

167
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Anran,

168
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,960
I already know who the culprit is.

169
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,240
When I eradicated the bandits,

170
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
there were remnants left.

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,960
They came after your father seeking revenge.

172
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm sorry, Anran.

173
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,200
This happened because of me.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't blame you.

175
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,040
I only blame those true evildoers.

176
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,760
By the way,

177
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,280
this is the last thing my father left behind.

178
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,560
Where did you get this ring?

179
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,880
I found it by chance,

180
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
in a drawer in my father's study.

181
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,120
I have no idea what he's trying to prove.

182
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,320
Anran, leave it to me.

183
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,400
I'll figure it out.

184
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,120
Anran.

185
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,080
Tomorrow,

186
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,240
I'll go with you to visit your father.

187
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,360
Master.

188
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,520
No matter how much we plan,

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,640
they still managed to reconcile.

190
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440
Rong Yin.

191
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Did I lose again?

192
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,760
Master, you never lose.

193
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
I'll take down

194
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,160
whoever wants to win.

195
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,440
A fine blade

196
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
doesn't need emotions.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
In my eyes,

198
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,800
you're just a useful blade.

199
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,640
Keep a close watch on Helian Zheng.

200
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,480
I have a feeling

201
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,920
that a grand show is about to begin.

202
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,400
