(Luan Daily)

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,000
Are there no servants left
in the mansion?

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,500
Having you, a patient, take care of me.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,680
Thanks to your care these past few days.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,880
I feel much better.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,320
I want to discuss something with you.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
What is it?

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
The owner of this cotton mill

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
has known my father for many years.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
He's honest and the prices are fair.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,640
But his honesty has offended many.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,040
Business has been tough.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,640
If you need anything,

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
you can contact him.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,720
(Jin Lehong)
Charge it to me.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,380
I'll settle it.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,480
Are you asking me to live off you?

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,160
Don't be silly.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm worried you'll bankrupt your family.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,360
Alright then.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,480
Join me in meeting some journalists tomorrow.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
Why?

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
To restore the governor's image.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,560
And to work with
the Commerce Union members.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,880
Okay.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,160
But I have a condition.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
I also want to help with
my father's case.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
For example,

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,920
what else can we investigate?

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
What do you mean by this?

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,920
Lieutenant Li said

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,480
Li Yang bought up
all the snake venom serum.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Storing these serums

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,880
requires specific warehouses.

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,760
So he must have trusted partners.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
We just need to check

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,360
which warehouses meet these conditions.

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,320
That's all we need.

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,320
As expected, you're very smart.

53
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Helian Zheng.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,440
Zheng.

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,000
Tang.

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Why are you here?

57
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,400
I got the time.

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
- So I came to see you.
- Alright.

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
A little gift.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,720
So this is your wife?

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
He's the Tang you often talk about.

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,120
He truly is handsome,

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
better-looking than you.

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,640
("Often talk about"?)

65
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
Good thing you praised Tang.

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm not angry at all.

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
- I'm glad.
- (He talks about me a lot.)

68
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,480
Tang, this is my wife.

69
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
He Anran.

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,480
Hello, I'm He Anran.

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,480
You're Zheng's wife.

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,080
I won't overstep.

73
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Please forgive me.

74
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Anran.

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,540
Go see Lieutenant Li.

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Discuss what just happened.

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Tang and I have more to discuss.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
Alright.

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,360
Tang, come here.

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,080
Your mansion is truly grand,

81
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,120
worthy of your status as the city's ruler.

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
If you like,

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
you can move in.

84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,440
I'm used to a quiet place.

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,080
Zheng, your health comes first.

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
You see,

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,240
busy with work lately,

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,440
I forgot to unseal your theater.

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,880
Should I unseal it for you now?

90
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,320
Let it stay sealed for now.

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,280
I rarely get some days to relax.

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
I could do things I love.

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Zheng.

94
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't worry about me.

95
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
Alright.

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
As long as you like.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Someone,

98
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,840
bring me two pots of good wine.

99
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Tang and I will have a few drinks.

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
Come on.

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,040
Tang.

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,120
You know,

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm now the city's governor.

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
You're a theater owner.

105
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,000
We both live comfortable lives.

106
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,520
But who would've thought,

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
back then, we were at the docks,

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
scavenging for leftover food,

109
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,440
sleeping under the open sky,

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,040
living in poverty.

111
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
But for me,

112
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,680
that time

113
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,840
wasn't so bitter.

114
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
In fact,

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,840
I still miss it a lot.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,280
You miss it, of course.

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,440
I was the one bringing you food.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
The reason I miss it

119
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
is not just us,

120
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
but because the feelings
were more genuine.

121
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,800
We were still young,

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,360
thinking that no matter how hard
the world was,

123
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
as long as we supported each other,

124
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,200
there was always hope.

125
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,760
But people have to grow up.

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,560
Look at you now,

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,600
you've grown so much that I'm impressed.

128
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,160
Back then, I was so simple,

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,760
and you were simple too.

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
It's just that everyone grows up.

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,240
As we grow up,

132
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,680
many things become more complicated.

133
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
That's why

134
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,920
people start to miss the past.

135
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
If we could go back,

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
would things be better?

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,960
Zheng.

138
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
If you had the chance to choose again,

139
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,840
would you go back with me?

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,320
Look at you,

141
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,160
still crying like a child.

142
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Come on.

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Tang.

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
No matter where or when,

145
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
having you

146
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
and Anran

147
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
is enough.

148
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,120
May all three of us

149
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
have everything we wish for,

150
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
and may all be well.

151
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,420
Even if it's just a dream.

152
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Let's make it a more beautiful,

153
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,240
better dream.

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
You have a great relationship.

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,920
Thank you for agreeing to our interview.

156
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,040
There have been rumors of marital issues.

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
How do you two feel about that?

158
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,760
They're just baseless rumors.

159
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
Not worth mentioning.

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
Let's focus on the people's livelihood.

161
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,120
Anran and I

162
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,440
are ready to govern the business world,

163
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,200
focus on the people's needs.

164
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,880
Honey,

165
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,560
what do you think?

166
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
The governor and I are united.

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,980
There's no chance of divorce.

168
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
People say you were once siblings.

169
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,480
Is marrying each other against ethics?

170
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,920
Some say that you used the bandit case

171
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
to threaten Mr. He.

172
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,680
Your marriage is just a way

173
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
to take over the Hes' assets.

174
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,000
They say the governor is too brutal,

175
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,160
and has a ruthless warlord reputation.

176
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,520
Honey.

177
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,600
These issues,

178
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,640
wouldn't it be better for you to explain?

179
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Don't forget,

180
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,040
He Molin is still in jail.

181
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
You brought them here yourself.

182
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,320
You're really digging your own grave.

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Only those who truly know the governor

184
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,560
can understand

185
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,720
what kind of person he really is.

186
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,360
Whenever I'm in danger,

187
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
he's always the first to find me,

188
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,120
protect me,

189
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
and save me.

190
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,400
He's also the governor of Luan City.

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Though his methods are harsh,

192
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,680
his fists

193
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
only target the wicked.

194
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
His back

195
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,840
is for the people in the Luan City.

196
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,240
Though we had a falling out

197
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,400
over the bandit case,

198
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
I believe

199
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,360
he is just someone dedicated to the truth.

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,920
As for those who question
our sibling relationship,

201
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,440
back then, I followed my mother
into the He family.

202
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
It was her

203
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,440
who protected me from bullying.

204
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,400
It was also her

205
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,560
who became my salvation.

206
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,110
Brother.

207
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,320
I've sent charcoal
to Concubine Liang's room.

208
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,240
Don't worry.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
The governor was once my stepbrother,

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,440
and he's a very important person in my life.

211
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Back then, he was cautious and humble,

212
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,400
but for me,

213
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,560
he became the bravest man in the world,

214
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
shielding me from harm,

215
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,800
sheltering me from wind and rain.

216
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,800
This kind of care

217
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,720
