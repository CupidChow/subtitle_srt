the doctor said I've fully recovered.

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,120
I don't need to have this.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,320
You need to nourish your body.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,240
I've just stewed it.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,720
Let me feed you.

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,320

49
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Look.

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
Do you like it?

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
I like it.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
This is my happiest time
in the past five years.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,160
Thank you.

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,960
(I once thought)

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
(that in this lifetime,)

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
(we'd only be entangled by hatred.)

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,320
(But heaven heard my prayers)

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,640
(and granted me a reunion with you.)

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,680
(He Anran.)

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,920
(Thank you)

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
(for willing to fall in love with me.)

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
The assassin who silenced Li Yang

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
and the bandits who kidnapped Anran

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,640
used weapons from your old troops.

65
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
Since they were my old troops,

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,920
what do they have to do with me now?

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,680
From the kidnapping case of wealthy children,

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,440
He Molin's imprisonment,

69
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,760
Anran's abduction,

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,440
to the bandits trying to blow me up...

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
The only goal

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,400
was to clear all obstacles.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
So the person behind all these

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,200
can claim the gold mine without hesitation.

75
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,360
That person

76
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
can only be you.

77
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Helian Zheng.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,080
Don't forget,

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,480
when you were at your lowest,

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,680
I was the one who took you in.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,160
Is that so?

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,920
I survived a pile of corpses on my own.

83
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,320
To you,

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm just a sharp and useful blade.

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,080
The reason I made it through alive

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
isn't because of your mercy.

87
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,840
It's because my will to live is unyielding.

88
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,600
Even if...

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,400
you truly formed troops with the bandits,

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,440
it doesn't matter.

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
But now you can rest easy,

92
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,520
because I've worked with neighboring cities

93
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
to launch a major purge.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
The last remnants of the bandits

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,040
won't survive this time.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
Zheng,

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,480
it seems I should step down.

98
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,600
Zheng,

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,880
everything here
will belong to you from now on.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,200
Zhao Zhiqian.

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,640
This is the last time I'll see you.

102
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
We are no longer bonded.

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,920
Helian Zheng,

104
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
you really have a tough life.

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,840
I couldn't kill you even with such a trap.

106
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,440
And it cost me

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
so many pawns I trained painstakingly.

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,440
I won't forget

109
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
this debt.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,080
This studio is truly unique.

111
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
Compared to the mansion,

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,800
this studio

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
is where Anran loves to stay the most.

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Come on,

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,440
try the afternoon tea I made myself.

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
How is it?

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400
It's really good.

118
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,120
It's Zheng's favorite green tea.

119
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,280
As long as you like it.

120
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,040
Zheng, here's your favorite
Sweet Tofu Pudding.

121
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
Tang,

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
the Spicy Tofu Pudding Zheng said you like.

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,600
Since when did Zheng like sweet foods?

124
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,680
I remember he only liked spicy ones.

125
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Anran likes it,

126
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,920
so now I like it too.

127
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,280
Seeing you and Miss He so close,

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,360
as his younger brother,

129
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I feel truly pleased.

130
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,600
I carved these by myself.

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,040
Consider them a wedding gift for you two.

132
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,080
Thank you, Tang.

133
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,480
They're truly exquisite.

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,800
Are they a butterfly and a bead?

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,760
The hollow bead symbolizes unity.

136
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,000
The butterfly represents
happiness and health.

137
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,360
I hope it brings you good fortune.

138
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,480
What a wonderful blessing!

139
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,880
Tang, you're really handy.

140
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
Zheng, I'll attach it to your gun holster.

141
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
Alright.

142
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,980
The pudding is getting cold, drink it.

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,240
Then feed me.

144
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
It's delicious.

145
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,560
(He Anran, Helian Zheng,)

146
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,080
(why do you get to be happy?)

147
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,880
(While I live alone in a nightmare.)

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Losers!

149
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
If it weren't for your selfishness,

150
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,040
he would've been dead

151
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,560
and you wouldn't have to sulk here.

152
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,240
The governor seems to

153
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,200
truly care about you.

154
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,400
I heard he even gifted you
a private residence.

155
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,440
But honestly, I still think you

156
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
look even more stunning

157
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,800
with your makeup on.

158
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Zhao Zhiqian,

159
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
stay away from me.

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,140
I can't stand the filth.

161
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,480
Mo Yutang.

162
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Don't you forget,

163
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
everything you have now

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,720
was given to you by me.

165
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,160
Old man,

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,160
take a good look.

167
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm no longer that Mo Yutang

168
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
you could manipulate.

169
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,520
Take your dirty hands off it.

170
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,220
(Helian Zheng, May 29th, Year Seventeen)

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
Mo Yutang.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
You hate me.

173
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,960
But haven't you become just like me?

174
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm the one who understands you the most.

175
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,960
So,

176
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,480
don't even think of going against me.

177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,800
If I were to die,

178
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
before my death,

179
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
I'd make sure to expose your darkest side

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600
to the public.

181
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
Finished?

182
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,880
Then leave now.

183
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,840
What?

184
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,920
Don't want me to bring up the past, huh?

185
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,720
Alright.

186
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,480
Just think of it

187
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
as my final deal with Lu Sheng Tower.

188
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
You have to take it.

189
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,560
Yutang,

190
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,160
your body

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
still smells as fragrant

192
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,760
as before.

193
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Rong Yin, I need to bathe.

194
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,320
Stay back!

195
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,360
Don't come over!

196
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,680
- You have a face
- Let me go.

197
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,760
- even more beautiful than an actress.
- Please let me go.

198
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,520
You even smell nice.

199
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,720
I didn't expect

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,520
to reach this move so soon.

201
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,720
This moment...

202
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,440
I don't want to wait anymore.
