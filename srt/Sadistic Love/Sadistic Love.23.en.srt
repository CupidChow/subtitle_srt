Tang,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,080
stop being so stubborn.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
Let me tell you,

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,880
I killed He Molin.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,280
And I used Zhao Zhiqian

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,600
to make her believe you were the culprit.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,360
I saw you turn against each other
at the funeral.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,800
You can't imagine how happy I was.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,720
Tang...

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,280
This must be one of the few happy moments

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,840
in my otherwise painful life.

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,760
Now,

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,400
I will return all my love and hatred

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720

The Year of Rooster,

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,880
what a great year.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,440

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,360
Tang.

35
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,800
Tang.

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
The Year of Pig

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,240
is the year we parted ways.

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,600
Brother, I'll head out first.

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Go ahead.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Brother.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,140
Wait for me to come back.

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
Tang.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,520
I'll wait and roast

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,520
sweet potatoes for you.

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
I understand.

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,560
You've endured so much pain.

47
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,960
But I've never intended to deceive you.

48
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
You asked me to wait for you.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
And I truly did wait.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
But the He Family
came to take my mother away.

51
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,680
I waited for a long time.

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,560
But my mother still took me away.

53
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,120
I left you a message.

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,120
I thought you'd wait for me.

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,860
(I went to He's Mansion. I'll be back.)

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
But when I returned, you were gone.

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,200
I even asked Anran

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,360
to beg her father to take you in.

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,440
Tang,

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
why won't you trust me?

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,240
I've always regarded you as my brother.

62
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,680
Impossible.

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,240
You're lying to me.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
When I went back,

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,400
there was clearly nothing there.

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,200
(I went to He's Mansion.)
I found it out

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,480
(I'll be back.)
on my own.

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,160
Tang.

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
Just kill me.

70
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,120
Helian Zheng.

71
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,880
Don't push me.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,720
If...

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,400
this can extinguish the hatred
in your heart,

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
and bring back

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,320
the pure and kind Tang you once were,

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,080
then my life

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,720
is yours to take.

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,880
Helian Zheng, don't push me.

79
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,080
Helian Zheng, stay back!

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,120
Tang.

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,880
I told you not to push me.

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,280
Helian Zheng.

83
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,800
No.

84
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,880
No.

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Tang.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Tang, listen to me.

87
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,760
We are brothers.

88
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,480
No matter how many mistakes you've made,

89
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,720
you are still my brother.

90
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,480
You are my family.

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
I regret it.

92
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,920
Back when you were at your lowest,

93
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,800
if I had been by your side,

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
shielding you from the storm,

95
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,080
would you have ended up like this?

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Tang,

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
wake up.

98
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,360
You're not someone who lives on hatred.

99
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,240
Zheng,

100
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,280
I have no way back now.

101
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,920
I won't accept any judgment either.

102
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
Protect the governor!

103
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Wait, don't shoot!

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,680
Don't shoot!

105
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600

112
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,320
can compare to Lu Sheng in my heart.
