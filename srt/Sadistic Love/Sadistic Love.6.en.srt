Go ahead.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,720
The theater's Master wants to see you.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,180
It's scheduled for 8 PM tonight.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,760
We've taken down many undercovers

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
of Lu Sheng Tower recently.

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,560
He's getting worried.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,640
He should show his cards.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
He should tell me the truth

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,280
about He Molin colluding with the bandits.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Please just let me go.

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,180
There are twenty more hostages inside.

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,330
When they give me the money,

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,560
I'll give you everything, okay?

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,480
As long as you let me go,

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
I'll give you all my money.

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,400
It's so noisy.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,240
Can't you see it?

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,520
I'm not short of money.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
But I'm missing something.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,680
Do you know what it is?

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
As long as you let me go,

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,990
I'll give you whatever you want.

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,760
I want the life of Zhao Zhiqian,

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,360
who is your biggest buyer.

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,590
Master,

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
how should we handle the orphans?

42
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,920
How many informants

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,600
have been eliminated by the governor?

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Ten.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,990
Then double the replacements.

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,240
Send them all to the unit.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,360
What time is it now?

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Just after seven.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
Notify Rong Yin

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,060
that honored guest is arriving.

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
Prepare for a bath.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,440
Tonight, we have only one guest.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
Are you satisfied

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,320
with the arrangement?

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,920
This voice sounds very familiar.

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,160
I thought you were an actor forced by life.

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
But I didn't expect

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,040
you're a carefree gentleman.

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,280
Living a carefree life

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
is the most comfortable way.

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
Master,

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,440
are you a chess player

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,080
or an onlooker?

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,480
Living in a fleeting dream,

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,560
would you like to grab a drink?

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
Since we're having a drink,

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
why don't you show your true face?

can be together again.

you and I shared the same meal.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,980
and let us meet in Luan City.

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,120
I haven't been happy in a long time.

128
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Who would've thought

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,280
the once fragile young man

130
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,840
has become the Master of Lu Sheng Tower?

131
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,880
To make a living in this chaotic place,

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,480
I have to do many things.

133
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
But, don't worry.

134
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,080
I only sell information.

135
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
That's all.

136
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,160
Don't I believe you?

137
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
Come on.

138
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
Tang,

139
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,480
do you like acting?

140
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,900
I remember when I was young,

141
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,280
you shared a story with me.

142
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Lu Sheng was drunk in a fleeting dream.

143
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,740
I like listening to Chinese operas

144
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,340
and watching them play.

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
But I just don't enjoy acting.

146
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,760
No one in the play

147
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,160
can compare to Lu Sheng in my heart.

148
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
Tang,

149
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,280
do you remember the games we played as kids?

150
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
Come on.

151
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,080
When we're little, we used stones as darts.

152
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,560
You taught me that.

153
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,560
I wonder which one of us

154
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,290
will get the lucky draw today.

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Tang,

156
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm really happy to find you.

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,240
Zheng,

158
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
did you really look for me?

159
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,240
Of course.

160
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Very good.

161
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
Now,

162
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,990
I should call you governor now, right?

163
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Tang,

164
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,640
it don't matter between us.

165
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,360
It matters.

166
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,080
Today, I'm very happy

167
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
to meet you again.

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,560
I'll give you a gift.

169
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,280
Baihua Church has been closed for a long time

170
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
since you handled bandits.

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,280
He Molin is being hidden there.

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Besides my people,

173
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,280
outsiders are also watching the He Family.

174
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,260
Compassion for people's lives.

175
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
Life is like a blooming ephemeral flower.

176
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
A night's fleeting fragrance.

Fame and fortune, all a dream.

179
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,040
In dreams, my soul is intoxicated.

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Awaking, we each go our separate ways.

181
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,720
A fleeting dream.
