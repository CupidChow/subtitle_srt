00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,840

189
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,680
I never laid a hand on your mother.

190
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,320
If that's the case,

191
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,400
you still hold a grudge against me.

192
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,280
I have nothing more to say.

193
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,680
But Anran,

194
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,040
Anran is innocent.

195
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,360
Listen carefully,

196
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,760
now and in the future,

197
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,720
Anran will always be my only wife.

198
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,360
You two are siblings, you...

199
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,640
If I cared about reputation,

200
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,240
how could I publicly
marry my own sister?

201
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,080
I'll investigate

202
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,960
what you said.

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,240
You'd better pray

204
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
these matters have nothing to do with you.

205
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Today is Anran's birthday.

206
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,800
In a while,

207
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll send someone to take you out.

208
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,000
He Zheng.

209
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,080
He Zheng.

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,000
He Zheng!

211
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
He Zheng!

212
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,580
(He's Mansion)

213
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,120
Yun.

214
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Has everything been well at home lately?

215
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
Everything is fine, don't worry.

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,520
Miss, don't worry too much.

217
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,840
The master will surely be fine.

218
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,120
- Master.
- Master.

219
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,880
Miss, look who's here.

220
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,000
Master has returned.

221
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,680
Father.

222
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,240
You're finally out.

223
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,360
Your injuries...

224
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,640
It's nothing.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,990
What about the governor?

226
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,920
He found the person who framed me,

227
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
so I was released.

228
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,400
Father, I missed you so much.

229
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,600
Hey, hey...

230
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
A young lady shouldn't act like this.

231
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,880
Father, sit down.

232
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
Anran,

233
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,880
how about

234
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,280
you break things off with He Zheng,

235
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,560
and we leave Luan City, okay?

236
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,600
Father.

237
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,040
I don't regret it.

238
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,600
Alright.

239
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

240
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,200
As long as you're happy, that's enough.

241
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,480
Today is your birthday.

242
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
I will celebrate it with you.

243
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,320
You're still the best,

244
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,520
remembering my birthday.

245
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,880
I remember it too.

246
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
Ming'an.

247
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,240
Ming'an.

248
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
Mr. He.

249
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,800
This is the wine
I brought back from France.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
I guarantee you'll like it.

251
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,760
Good, good.

252
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll leave you two to talk.

253
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll go to the kitchen,

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
and arrange for a few dishes.

255
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Let's celebrate Anran's birthday together.

256
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,120
Alright.

257
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,200
Ming'an, I...

258
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
No need to say anything.

259
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,560
You can accept a birthday gift, right?

260
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,760
Happy birthday, Anran.

261
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,680
Thank you, Ming'an.

262
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,560
(Helian Zheng and He Anran)

263
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,560
(Marriage Certificate)
(are combined)

264
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,600
(as husband and wife.)

265
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,040
(May our life be peaceful)

266
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,480
(and the world stable.)

267
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,960
Mother.

268
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
Look, the thing I feared the most,

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,760
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

270
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,200
(Mother,)

271
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,300
(forgive me for letting go of hatred)

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,880
(and only seeking peace in this lifetime.)

273
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,720
Happy birthday.

274
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,280
Happy birthday.

275
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,560
Happy birthday.

276
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,720
Someone.

277
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,800
Governor.

278
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Why hasn't Anran return

279
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,880
from the He's Mansion?

280
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,680
She stayed there for dinner.

281
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,640
Chu Ming'an also went there.

282
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,760
You may leave.

283
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,440
