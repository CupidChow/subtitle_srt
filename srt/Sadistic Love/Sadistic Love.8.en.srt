Ming'an.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,000
Anran, long time no see.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Three hours have passed already.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Tell me,

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,640
when should I save him

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
to make him grateful to me?

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
The wound is sutured well.

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
I only taught you once,

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,200
yet you learned it all.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,960
Ming'an.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,240
Thanks to your connections
for the serum,

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,680
he would've been in real danger.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,720
Anran.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't touch her.

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,680
You're awake.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
Be careful.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,120
Isn't this the troubled boy
Mr. He adopted?

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Never thought

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
you'd become a governor.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,200
But your temper is still the same.

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
As a doctor, I advise you

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,480
not to get angry often,

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
or you may get a fever at night.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Anran's studio is always elegant,

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,520
not a good place for you to recover.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,240
I am Anran's husband.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
Anran's studio is my studio.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
With Anran taking care of me,

43
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,600
I'll recover quickly.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Those who are unwanted, please leave.

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,880
It was Ming'an who saved you.

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,600
No need to thank me.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
But Helian Zheng,

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
since you've married Anran,

49
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,740
you should treat her well.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,680
She's been exhausted

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
from saving you.

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
Aren't you worried about her?

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,920
Ming'an,

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,480
thank you for today.

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,640
Why don't you go back first?

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
I'll visit you another day

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,120
and see your parents.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,560
Don't go.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,760
Since it's inconvenient for you,

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,520
I'll come to visit you later.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,440
The governor's wound

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,140
needs follow-up treatment.

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,480
I'll also bring

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,440
the gift I brought back from England.

65
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,120
Lieutenant Li, see him out.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Mr. Chu.

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,040
This way.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,120
Anran,

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,480
I'll contact you later.

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,200
Okay.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,000
What's okay?

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,960
What are you doing?

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,240
You're crying.

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,240
Just sand in my eyes.

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,320
Ming'an is right.

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
You should go back.

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,280
This place isn't suitable for healing.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
I saved you just by chance.

79
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
Don't think I care about you much.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,760
Helian Zheng.

81
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
Helian Zheng.

82
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
Fever again.

83
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,720
Didn't you promise me

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
that no one in the city

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,880
would have the antidote

86
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,880
to save the governor?

87
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,600
I won't dare again.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,120
Spare me, Master.

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Master.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
I won't dare again.

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Seems like

92
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,860
- your ears aren't working.
- Spare me.

93
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Rong Yin.

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,640
Kill him.

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Rong Yin.

96
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,280
Don't let me down again next time.

97
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
You are fair in rewards and penalties.

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,240
Why did you spare me this time?

99
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,240
To make you work harder, of course.

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Find another group of people.

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,120

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,480
has a tough life.
