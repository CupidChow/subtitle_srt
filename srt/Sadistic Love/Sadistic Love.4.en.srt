00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,880
I'm asking to drink!

Drink it!

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
Drink!

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
Master, you can kill anyone.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
But don't hurt yourself.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,380
Where did you go wrong?

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
I shouldn't say this much.

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,760
Since the theater has been shut down,

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
then we

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,680
take a break

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,760
and await important guests.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
She's been here?

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,060
The soldiers at the door just told me

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,800
she is waiting for you here.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,260
No one can persuade her.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,660
Go prepare a bowl of ginger tea

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
with brown sugar.

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,280
The prison guard

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,680
said Nanjing took He Molin.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,380
Investigate it thoroughly.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Also,

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
replace the prison staff.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,800
Deal with those who are disloyal.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,040
Got it.

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,440
You do care about Madam.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
I want her to stay alive,

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,200
so I can torment her further.

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,710
Helian Zheng,

42
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,960
what have you done to my father?

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
I only promised He Molin wouldn't die.

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
You didn't see his body yet.

45
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm already being lenient for you.

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,280
I didn't expect

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,600
you can't even handle this teasing.

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,600
You're crazy!

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Let go of my father.

50
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,800
Otherwise, we'll both die.

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
Shoot.

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,400
If you kill me,

53
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,680
your father is also doomed.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,080
Don't push me.

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,440
Shoot!

56
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Let my father go.

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,560
I want you to let my father go.

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,040
Come on.

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,160
Here.

60
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,000
Headshot with one bullet.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Or here?

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,360
A broken heart can take a life.

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
I can forget all love and hate.

64
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,600
He Anran.

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Shoot me.

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,680
I admit

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
I can't do that.

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,640
It was all my fault five years ago.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,120
It has nothing to do with my father.

70
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,000
You let my father go.

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,640
I'll pay off the He Family's debt.

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
Why?

73
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,040
Why don't I have the choice to end my life?

74
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,520
He Anran,

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
looks like

76
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,720
you don't hate me as much as you thought.

77
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,680
Don't worry.

78
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,480
I'll keep your father's life.

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
I want him to stay alive.

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
I want him to see

81
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
how I humiliate his beloved daughter.

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,400
I'll fully investigate your father.

83
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Before that,

84
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,320
you'd better not anger me.

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Governor,

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Nanjing has responded.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,960
They are unclear about He Molin's situation.

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,880
A guard yielded under interrogation.

89
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,240
He said Commander Zhao's men gave a pass.

90
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,590
(Zhao Zhiqian, Commander of Luan City)

91
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,930
(Helian Zheng's adoptive father)
Father,

92
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,800
did you take He Molin?

93
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,840
Are you here to hold me accountable

94
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
or discuss business?

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,160
Please tell me the truth.

96
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,160
I'll handle this promptly.

97
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,360
The Nanjing Government is here to take him.

98
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,640
Even I can't stop it.

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,120
There're many victims in the case.

100
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,240
It involves multiple provinces and cities.

101
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
I think He Molin

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,320
can't be saved.

103
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Zheng,

104
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,120
stay out of this mess.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
Father,

106
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,000
I have my own plans

107
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
for He Family's matters.

108
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Do you know what this ring

109
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,360
means?

110
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,600
Initially, they made three merit rings,

111
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,480
awarded to those with distinguished service.

112
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,160
I

113
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,560
am one of them.

114
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,920
Zheng,

115
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,080
I have no wife or children.

116
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,680
I only recognize you as my adopted son.

117
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
In the future,

118
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
my position

119
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
as well as this ring

120
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,520
are all yours.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,160
Can you bear to disappoint me?

122
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,960
I don't dare.

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
Nowadays,

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,990
it's fine if He Molin is not in Luan City.

125
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
You can focus

126
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,000
on getting the gold mine from He Anran.

127
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,640
From now on, cut ties with her,

128
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,480
so you don't fall deeper.

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,000
He Anran is a tool to get back at He Molin.

130
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
The reason I keep He Anran

131
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,320
is that I also want him to feel

132
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,920
how it feels to lose a loved one.

133
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,960
You taught me

134
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,880
to mentally break the enemy.

135
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,960
That's the most devastating

136
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
and the most painful.

137
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Others may believe what you said.

138
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,120
How could I not know

139
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,440
you still care about her?

140
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Zheng,

141
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,920
don't forget

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
how your mother

143
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,320
died.

144
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Zheng,

145
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,000
your position

146
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,720
was hard-won.

147
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,040
You need to secure this position.

148
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,480
Currently,

149
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,880
military supplies are tight.

150
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,360
Starting mining to raise funds is correct.

151
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,070
If not needed,

152
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,680
don't go to that theater often.

153
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,710
That kind of shady place

154
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,840
will only hurt your reputation.

155
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,160
Thank you for worrying about me.

156
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm deeply grateful.

157
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll also follow your advice.

158
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
What?

159
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
It's just a spoonful of saltwater.

160
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,640
You can't bear it?

161
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
Next,

162
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,880
I don't use water.

163
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,400
How about it?

164
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,840
The more you hit me,

165
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,840
the less I'll give you the gold mine key.

166
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,920
Alright.

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,040
Are you happy?

168
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
Are you happy?

169
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,960
You're not afraid of dying.

170
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,880
But aren't you afraid of others getting hurt?

171
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,520
He Molin, don't forget,

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,760
you still have a beautiful daughter

173
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,040
at the Governor's Mansion.

174
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,720
By the way,

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,640
you once forced your concubine to death,

176
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
I still remember

177
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
this grudge.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,480
You know her?

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,520
Let me know once you've decided.

180
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
I'd like to see

181
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,960
that your gold mine important

182
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,240
or your precious daughter is more important?

183
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,520
Say it or not?

184
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
Say it or not?

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
Say it or not?

186
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
(This is not the time to be sad.)

187
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
(Tao Te Ching)
(I must ensure my father's safety.)

188
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
(He said)

189
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,040
(there's the most important dowry left to me)

190
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,660
(in my mother's handwritten scriptures.)

191
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,560
(He still asked me to hold it tight)

192
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,780
(and not to give it to others.)

193
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,720
(Maybe this is the gold mine map.)

194
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,080
(He Molin)
(Citibank Safe Deposit.)

195
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
(The gold mine map should be right here.)

196
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
(Before things get unclear,)

197
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,720
(it can't be discovered.)

198
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,840
This dean works for Zhiqian Zhao?

199
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,600
Yes.

200
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,840
Zhao Zhiqian remains his top patron.

201
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
He deserves to die.

202
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,280
Tell the buyer

203
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,840
that we'll take this deal.

204
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

205
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,080
Looks like we'll have a storm tonight.

206
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
He must be in a lot of pain.

207
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm so happy.

208
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,260
(Memorial Tablet of Mrs. Helian)

209
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
Don't forget

210
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,120
how your mother died.

211
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Mother!

212
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,580
(He Molin, I want you to go to hell with me)

213
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,120
Governor.

214
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,560
Get out!

215
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
Governor, it's thundering.

216
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,980
If you don't take medicine,

217
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,160
your body will get worse.

218
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm asking you to get out.

219
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Governor...

220
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,600
Go away.

221
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,070
She chose to die

222
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
on the engagement day
of the lady and Mr. Chu.

223
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
It's truly unlucky.

224
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
Even a toad dreams of swans.

225
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,560
He should check himself first.

226
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,080
How can he deserve the lady?

227
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,270
Exactly.

228
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,600
Only Young Master Chu

229
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
deserves to stand beside Miss He.

230
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Only a woman like his mother

231
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,160
(Liang Rushuang)
has such a bad kid.

232
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
She deserves to die.

233
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,360
Bah! You jinx!

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,240
