Father.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Zheng has found the murderer
who took your life.

You can finally rest in peace.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,480
Father,

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,880
I will take good care of Anran.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,120
I will never leave her, not for a lifetime,

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,400
and never let her suffer any harm again.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,360
Anran,

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,240
we must live well.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,560
Only then can your father rest in peace.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
Anran,

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,600
I'll head out with Lieutenant Li later.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,440
I might be back a bit late.

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,440
Go home first,

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,720
prepare dinner and wait for me.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,280
We'll have dinner together.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll wait for you.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,840
Go ahead.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,600
Anran.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
Be careful on your way back.

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,580
(Late He Molin)

(Auspicious Signs)

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,560
Governor.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
After the coroner woke up, he said

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
he didn't know why He Molin sought him.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,880
When I told him,

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,880
He Molin had his brother-in-law

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,200
make this replica ring,

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
and showed him the ring,

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
he handed me this.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
Is this the coroner's work record?

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,200
The coroner said,

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
during an autopsy,

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
if he encounters puzzling details,

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,080
he'd record it down in his notebook.

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,260
(Strange marks appeared on the body.)

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,280
This is my mother's autopsy report.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,440
After my mother passed away,

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,240
her body had

53
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,200
the same mark as the merit ring.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,920
This means,

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
Zhao Zhiqian is the real culprit.

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,160
(Zhao Zhiqian.)

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,600
(I've been mistaking you
for family all these years.)

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,480
And yet, you still haven't given me
the gold mine's key.

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,360
He's been too cautious.

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
I'm truly out of options.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm begging you.

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,000
Let me see my son one last time.

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,080
You will never see him again.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,040
How about this?

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,880
I'll send you to meet his father.

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,040
Didn't expect you
to be tougher than your mother.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
If I had known this earlier,

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,400
I would have eliminated you back then.

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
Zhao Zhiqian,

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
you're doomed.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,120
With just so few people?

72
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,160
How many must die tonight

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,880
to match the thunderstorm?

74
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
When did you start setting this up?

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,040
Was it five years ago when you took me in?

76
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
Or even earlier,

77
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,280
when you learned He Molin
wanted to marry my mother?

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,360
Or perhaps...

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
when the He Family planned to dig gold?

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,240
If you pretended to know nothing

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,720
and keep being my son,

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
I could have provided you

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,280
with everything you wanted.

84
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,560
Money, He Anran,

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,280
would have been

86
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
within reach.

87
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,840
So,

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,640
I must take my mother's killer
as my adoptive father

89
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,600
live off the remnants
he lets slip through his fingers,

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,760
and misunderstand the one I've loved
for five years.

91
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,920
How ironic!

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Zhao Zhiqian.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Your dream is about to shatter.

94
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,960
Now, I'm giving you two choices.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
First,

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,040
get into this coffin,
and shoot yourself as an intact body.

97
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,280
Second,

98
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,760
face justice

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
and be shot.

100
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Do you think

101
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,480
I'd sit by and make a choice?

102
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Someone!

103
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,360
Helian Zheng,

104
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
your mother

105
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,240
was indeed killed by me.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,040
However,

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
the one who drove her to death

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,880
was actually you.

109
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,760
You may not know this yet,

110
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
but your father used to work under me.

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,160
But he married a beautiful wife.

112
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
If your mother had obeyed back then,

113
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
I might have spared your father's life.

114
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
But she was stubborn and ungrateful,

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
and took you to marry into the He's Mansion.

116
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,600
She thought she could escape
from me that way.

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,880
Fine.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,560
Since she refused to be my woman,

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
then she could be my pawn instead.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,400
I only used you to threaten her.

121
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,840
I didn't even do anything.

122
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,320
She was so scared
that she obeyed me completely.

123
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,880
Helian Zheng,

124
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,280
all these tragedies

125
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,720
started because of you.

126
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,640
Enough!

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,760
I will let you die with clarity today.

128
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Also,

129
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,240
your dear brother, Mo Yutang,

130
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,080
we've known each other for a long time.

131
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
I once told you,

132
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
this ring

133
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,440
represents honor,

134
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
and the mark it leaves

135
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,360
symbolizes a trophy.

136
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,160
Zheng.

137
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,240
Your dear brother and your mother

138
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,720
weren't just my pawns.

139
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,040

my mother,

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,560
Mo Yutang, and Anran,

143
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,680
I will personally

144
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,200
avenge all of them all at once.

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,480
Helian Zheng, you abuse your authority

146
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
and still dream of being a governor?

147
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
Rather than being a governor,

148
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,040
I'd rather kill you with my own hands.
