77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,160

80
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
I can save him.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
But the price is,

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,880
that you

83
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,800
shall marry me.

84
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,800

Apologies,

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,840
I messed up your art studio.

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
I'll personally do your makeup.

You...

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
This color is too bright.

94
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,320
I think Zheng might like something simpler.

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,960
Luckily,

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,840
I brought one with me.

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Mo Yutang, what exactly do you mean?

98
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,960
Tell me,

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,320
if I destroy Zheng's most cherished woman,

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,960
would he feel worse than death?

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,520
You and Zheng...

102
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
What happened between you two?

103
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,320
Let go of me first.

104
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,000
No way.

105
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,480
I finally saw his reputation destroyed.

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,240
Now, with just this last step,

107
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,880
he'll fall into hell.

108
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
You hate Zheng.

109
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
This is what he owes me.

110
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,400
I once treated him as my only family.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,240
But in his heart,

112
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
there's only you, Anran.

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
He gave me a reason to live,

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,880
making me believe
I'd never be abandoned again.

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,920
But he still abandoned me

116
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
for wealth and power.

117
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,840
That's why

118
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,320
I want to make him lose everything.

119
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
It's not like that.

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
He's been looking for you,

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
he never gave up.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
- He...
- Shut up!

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
It's too late to say anything now.

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm living in hell.

125
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,200
Don't think you'll enjoy yourselves either.

126
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,840
You're completely insane.

127
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,160
There's something even crazier.

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,040
The wedding is tomorrow.

129
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,680
The location is

130
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
Lu Sheng Tower.

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,480
Is everything ready at Lu Sheng Tower?

132
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes.

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
It's just...

134
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Speak.

135
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,040
Master,

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
do you really have to do this?

137
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,800
Do you know why

138
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,680
I loaded these five bullets?

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Because they represent

140
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
the five years I least want to face.

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,960
It's time to bring this to an end.

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Today's sunlight

143
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,520

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760

148
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,680
That former governor's wife
is really something.

149
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,760
He just went to prison,

150
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,960
and she married an actor.

151
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,760

153
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,720
The groom is his sworn brother.

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,560
The sister married the brother,

155
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,800
and then the younger brother.

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,650
How messy!

157
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,520
What are you saying?

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,880
So unlucky.

159
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,160
It's our turn for duty again.

160
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,320
Yeah, it is.

161
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
Come back here!

162
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Anran.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
Let me out!

164
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,760
Chu Ming'an!

165
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,160
They said Anran...

166
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,400
Calm down.

167

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
Shut up!

171
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,120
Because

172
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520

Zheng.

176
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,800
Is my bride beautiful?

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,160
Tang,

178

Your lover is here.

180
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,360
Why don't you call out to him?

181
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
Let him come save you.

Anran.

184
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,560
Don't let him threaten you.

185
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
He's not the brother you knew anymore.

186
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,600
He's lost his mind.

187
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,120
Leave, don't worry about me.

188
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
- Noisy.
- Just go.

189
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,520
- Rong Yin!
- Anran.

190
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,600
Let her go!

191
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,840
Take her away.

192
