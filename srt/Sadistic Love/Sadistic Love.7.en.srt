He Molin?

Why is he here?

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,720
I got a tip

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,520
that He Molin is hiding in Baihua Church.

After the bandit incident,

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,640
did you order to seal this place?

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,200

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,880

30

It's safer to hand him over
to the Nanjing government.

Father.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,080
Are you really completely unaware?

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,760

But the condition is

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
I need to see my father.

Lieutenant Li.

173
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The bleeding has stopped.

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
What about the test results?

175
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
This is a common snake venom.

176
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,960
The killer smeared it on the dagger.

177
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
But strangely,

178
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,840
if the killer intended to kill,

179
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,640
why not use a stronger poison?

180
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,120
These are afterthoughts.

181
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,320
Lieutenant Li.

182
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,440
When did the governor get poisoned?

183
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,440
This is critical.

184
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,640
About two hours ago.

185
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,760
On the tram,

186
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,760
an assassin was tailing you.

187
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,920
He got hurt while saving you.

188
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,840
He was injured saving me.

189
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,040
But he didn't bring it up.

190
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,680
That's how he is.

191
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,400
Prefers to act more than explain.

192
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,040
Like with Mr. He's matter,

193
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
the governor didn't know he was moved.

194

Madam, you can stitch wounds?

199
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,680
My childhood friend studied medicine abroad.

200
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
He taught me a bit.

201
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,630
He said

202
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,240
the antidote time for common snake venom

203
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,400
is no more than four hours.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600

- Yes.

00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,400
they can't find the serum
