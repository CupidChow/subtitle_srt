meet me at Lu Sheng Tower.

ruining all the fun.

Send these people back to Zhao Zhiqian.

Don't ruin my good mood
for tomorrow's move.

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,120
I wanted to give you this surprise,

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,440
but I was busy during the day,

25
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,760
so it got delayed.

26
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
This place is quiet.

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,200
I think it suits you.

Do you like it?

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
It's really nice.

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120

It has your name on it.

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
What is this?

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,880
Did you fold all these?

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Yes, I did.

37
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
Next time I see Miss He,

38
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll give her one too.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
It symbolizes you two being together.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
Thank you.

41
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,000
Is this your maid?

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
I've seen her at the theater.

43
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,760
Greetings, Governor.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,480
Rong Yin, you may leave for now.

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
Go tidy up a bit.

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,920
Yes.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,120
Come, sit down, Tang.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Tang.

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,640
This is the photo we took last time.

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,720
I kept one.

51
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,260
This one is for you.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
It's our first photo together.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll treasure it.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,640
If you like it,

55
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
we can take one every year from now on.

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,240
Tang, you have a home now.

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
From now on,

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
Anran and I are your family.

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,120
What are they?

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,660
The birthday gifts I prepared for you

61
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,080
during the five years you were gone.

62
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,680
Even though your birthday's two months away,

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,000
I wanted to

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
give them to you in person early.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Do you like them?

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
I do.

67
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,200
You're so thoughtful.

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,780
Let me put them away.

69
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480
No, try them on and see if they fit.

70
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,720
- Come on, try them.
- Zheng.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
No, really, it's fine.

72
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
We're brothers, no need for formalities.

73
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
- Sit.
- Zheng.

74
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
No.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,440
Tang.

76
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
What...

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,800
What's going on with...?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
Look, it's a perfect fit.

79
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,320
The shoes fit.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Tang.

81
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
You've been through so much,

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
and I knew nothing about it.

83
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
Tang,

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,270
tell me,

85
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,480
who did this to you?

86
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,440
Tell me, and I'll go find them right now.

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,920
Tell me, Tang!

88
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Tang.

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
Tell me, Tang.

90
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,240
Tang!

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,400
I've forgotten about it!

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,840
Tang.

93
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,240
For Lu Sheng Tower to stand firm,

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
a price had to be paid.

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,680
Zheng.

96
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't regret it.

97
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,800
And it's not your fault.

98
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
Now that we've reunited,

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm already satisfied.

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Zheng.

101
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
From now on,

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
I'll rely on you to protect me.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Sure.

104
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,960
From now on,

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
I'll protect you.

106
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,580
Don't take on any jobs for now.

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,800
Handle things outside if needed.

108
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,240
Understood.

109
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,920
Now that He Molin has been released,

110
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,520
Zhao Zhiqian won't sit by.

111
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
Find a way to stir things up.

112
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,520
I want to create more distance

113
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
between them.

114
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm on it.

115
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,920
Thank you.

116
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,040
Helping you get dressed

117
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,080
is my duty.

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,440
Thank you for my father's case.

119
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
Making you happy is the top priority.

120
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,760
But your formality

121
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
makes me unhappy.

122
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,520
I just don't know

123
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,800
how to act around you.

124
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
Your mood is unpredictable.

125
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
Gentle this moment,

126
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
but the next,

127
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,080
cold and distant.

128
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,480
He Anran,

129
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,600
why won't you take a step closer to me?

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,720
Look into my heart

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,360
and see what I truly want.

132
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
What do you want?

133
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,580
Governor,

134
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,000
the refugee shelter is on fire.

135
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
What?

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
How is he?

137
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
The bleeding has stopped.

138
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,640
You're injured.

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,060
I'm fine.

140
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,240
Medical supplies are tight.

141
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
Save them for the others.

142
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
You need disinfection to prevent infection.

143
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
Better to treat your wound.

144
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,360
Ming'an,

145
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,400
Miss Wen,

146
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,840
you know each other?

147
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,960
Old classmates from studying abroad.

148
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
We're here to help.

149
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
Lately, bandits have been rampant.

150
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,360
More refugees may enter the city.

151
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,640
Let's not waste time.

152
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,960
Alright.

153
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Let's split up.

154
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,840
I'll go check on

155
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
the injured outside.

156
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,000
Go on.

157
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Take it slow.

158
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,680
I've always heard
that you're beautiful and kind.

159
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
Seeing you today, the rumors are true.

160
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,720
No wonder the governor can't forget you.

161
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
He used me to make you jealous.

162
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,640
I knew then, this man was just talking tough.

163
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,880
I'm He Anran.

164
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Nice to meet you.

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Wen Shiqing.

166
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
Currently Ming'an's classmate,

167
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,040
and soon to be the mother of his child.

168
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,480
Does Ming'an know?

169
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,550
It doesn't matter.

170
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,800
He'll be mine sooner or later.

171
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,400
From now on, I need to count on you
for his intel.

172
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,200
