(The sensational kidnapping case)

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,660
(of wealthy children was ultimately)

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,200
(resolved in Luan City.)

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,960
(Deserters colluded with roaming bandits,)

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,980
(harassing girls and committing evil deeds.)

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
(The new governor Helian Zheng)

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,540
(immediately set up a complete net)

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
(and eliminated over 20 bandits.)

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,700
Governor, the bandits have confessed.

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,190
(Helian Zheng, Governor of Luan City)

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,880
Governor,

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
you are injured.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,400
To catch these people,

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,400
it was worth getting a bit hurt.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,620
How are the confessions?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,160
(Interrogation record)
This is one bandit's confession.

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,960
(Lieutenant Li)
He is the undercover of Lu Sheng Tower

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,250
known for selling intelligence.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,360
These

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,400
are the leader's private accounts he found.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,770
He's also involved with some merchants,

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
including He Molin.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,320
We have full evidence now.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,240
We'll arrest He Molin tomorrow morning.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
After five years of patience,

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,360
finally, the moment has come.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
What about Miss He?

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
Go tell that noble lady

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,480
if she wants to save her father,

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,240
she must marry me.

44
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,070
(He Anran, He family's heiress
from Luan City)

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
Miss.

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,720
Miss, bad news!

47
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,070
What's wrong?

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,800
Master was taken by the governor's men.

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
What?

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,240
What happened?

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
The lieutenant said,

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,590
if you want to save the master's life,

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
you have to marry the governor.

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,880
(For He Molin,)

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,600
(she dare not refuse the marriage.)

56
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
(He Zheng,)

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,500
(it's been five years.)

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
(Where exactly are you?)

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
(He Anran,)

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,600
(the peace you desire)

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,040
(will never be there.)

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,980
=Episode 1=

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
(He Zheng,)

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,320
(is this your punishment for me?)

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,600
(Punish me for betraying you five years ago.)

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,760
(So in this life,)

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,920
(I can only stay with someone I don't love.)

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
(Even meeting you once is a distant dream.)

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
(I'm getting married today.)

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,800
(But the person I want to marry is not him.)

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,880
When did the He Family offend the governor?

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
Yeah.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,120
I heard Mr. He was taken away two days ago.

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,480
It's clearly a forced marriage.

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
But she can't refuse to marry.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
This is really awful.

77
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
Sis.

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,000
He Zheng.

79
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,040
Long time no see.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
It's you.

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
You're the governor of Luan City.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
Sis,

83
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
you seem really disappointed.

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,480
Could it be that you still want

85
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,320
to marry Young Master Chu?

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,960
It's a pity.

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,800
Five years later,

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,320
you can only marry me.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
Where is my father?

90
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Don't worry.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,080
I've already delivered candies to prison.

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Sis,

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,200
it's time for the wedding ceremony.

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
He Zheng,

95
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
you are my brother.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,760
I don't know what happened.

97
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,740
But there must be a misunderstanding.

98
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm begging you to let my father go.

99
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
A misunderstanding?

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,080
My mother died because of your father.

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,380
(Memorial Tablet of Mrs. Helian)

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,660
Is this also a misunderstanding?

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
Mother!

104
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,880
She committed suicide.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
Even the police said so.

106
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,240
It has nothing to do with my father.

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,240
Sis,

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,320
the wedding dress you're wearing

109
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,520
is really beautiful.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,200
Let us, the immoral brother and sister,

111
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,040
get married in public.

112
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,160
Let all the guests present

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
serve as our witnesses.

114
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Witness

115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,200
how I marry my sister.

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
Witness how absurd the He Family is.

117
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,620
(Lu Sheng Tower)

118
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
Master,

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,040
don't kill me.

120
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,840
You've been hiding there for so long.

121
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,600
There's no news at all.

122
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,640
Do you believe

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
what you just said?

124
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
Please spare me, Master.

125
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,400
I was forced by the governor's men,

126
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,880
so I gave him all the evidence.

127
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,700
(Interrogation record)

128
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,300
(File; Profile; He Molin)

129
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,080
Master, please spare my life.

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,420
(Mo Yutang, Master of Lu Sheng Tower)
Give me another chance, Master.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A traitor

132
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,520
should die.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,920
Let the governor collect your body.

134
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Any interesting news today?

135
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,380
He Family caused a big embarrassment.

136
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,580
(Rong Yin, Mo Yutang's bodyguard)
The brother married his sister.

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,240
This is the first time in Luan City.

138
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,880
Helian Zheng, Helian Zheng.

140
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,490
- After many years,
- Second bow to the parents.

141
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,960
you actually married her.

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,880
The couple bows to each other.

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Let me go.

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,200
The ceremony is over now.

145
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,680
Can you release my father?

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,120
Honey,

147
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,480
our wedding night just starts.

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,080
Next,

149
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
I will make you suffer

150
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
even more.

151
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,460
(The Governor's Mansion)

152
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,680
What are you doing?

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
You are as precious as pearls and treasures.

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,440
Under me, you're just ordinary.

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
Brother, no.

156
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
He Zheng is your brother.

157
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,320
Helian Zheng is not.

158
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
You once gave up He Zheng for Chu Ming'an.

159
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,640
Now, in order to save your father,

160
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,320
you chose the governor.

161
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,800
Helian Zheng has never been the first choice.

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,760
No, it's not like that. Back then...

163
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,080
Is it because we're siblings?

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,760
I held the wedding in the He's Mansion.

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
It's because everyone told me back then

166
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,950
that we're siblings

167
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,100
and we couldn't be together.

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,880
I insist on marrying you

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
in front of everyone,

170
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,080
humiliating you,

171
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,440
and tormenting you.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Let me go.

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,920
You don't want deaths on the wedding night.

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
He Anran,

175
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,600
this isn't He's Mansion anymore.

176
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
It's the Governor's Mansion.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
How dare you seek death here?

178
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,720
Do you believe I'll kill your father?

179
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,640
So you made such a big scene

180
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,000
to humiliate me.

181
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,900
You've really put in a lot of effort.

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
Tell me

183
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
what exactly I have to do

184
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,440
for you to release my father.

185
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Your family humiliated my mother first.

186
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,880
You abandoned me afterward.

187
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,800
What I want is simple.

188
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,520
First,

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,000
it's you, He Anran,

190
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,000
and second,

191
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,640
it's your family's gold mine.

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,400
Gold mine.

193
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,140
Turns out it's because of the gold mine.

194
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Okay.

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,980
I'll give you the gold mine.

196
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,240
You let me and my father go.

197
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,800
We will never return to Luan City.

198
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,480
I've been clear.

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
First,

200
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,000
what I want is

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
He

202
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,560
An

203
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
ran.

204
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,760
Let you go?

205
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,200
Will you and Young Master Chu elope?

206
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,560
Don't forget

207
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,480
we've already married.

208
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,200
You are born to be mine

209
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,280
even if you are dead.

210
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,560
Your family's gold mine

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
and you,

212
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,520
I want it all.

213
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,920
I will repay the humiliation

214
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,240
from five years ago

215
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,680
