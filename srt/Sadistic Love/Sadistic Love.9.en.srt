00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
Father.

Anran.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Father.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,960
- Why are you beaten?
- Sit.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Who did this? Was it Helian Zheng?

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,880
No, no, no.

20
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,950
It wasn't He Zheng.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,240
It was He Zheng who saved me.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
The situation is urgent.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
Listen,

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,800
there's a man named Li Yang.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,280
He secretly arranged
the bandit job for me.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
Father, don't worry.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,440
I will definitely find him.

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
Okay.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,360
By the way, father,

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,560
Ming'an is back.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,760
We have one more person to help us out.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,800
I've always been an honest,

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,360
and law-abiding businessman.

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
I've never harmed anyone.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,800
The only mistake

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,280
was trusting the wrong person.

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,680
It's karma, karma...

38
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Father, as long as we do the right thing,

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,080
you will clear your name.

40
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
How about you?

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,580
Did He Zheng give you a hard time?

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,560
It's all my fault.

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,720
He won't do anything to me.

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,520
He still wants the gold mine.

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,760
You two are siblings.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
How can you get married?

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
This is just ridiculous.

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Father, I need to ask you something.

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,880
Why did Concubine Liang

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,000
commit suicide?

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,840
Brother believes it's related to you.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,080
This woman betrayed the He Family.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,440
She wronged us.

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
He Zheng came to seek revenge on us.

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,600
You must trust me.

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,360
Of course, I trust you.

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
By the way, father,

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
I have found the dowry you gave me.

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
- Good.
- Don't worry.

60
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,200
I will use it well.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,560
I'll protect you.

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Good.

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,600
Zheng.

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,560
Why are you here?

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
Why didn't you call me?

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,120
Thank you for the address

67
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,760
you gave me the other day,

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,280
and for the small gift.

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,760
Tang.

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,680
Your outfit

71
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,520
is quite unique.

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
You've brought me some wine.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,440
Why bother making the trip?

74
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Didn't I finish your precious wine

75
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,360
the other day?

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
So I brought two bottles of imported liquor.

77
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
By the way,

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,360
visit my mansion someday.

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
Take a look at my new home.

80
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Zheng.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,280
Haven't heard me perform yet, right?

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
How about

83
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,680
I sing you a piece for you.

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960

Hello.

112
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,440
You must be Miss He
who just married Zheng.

113
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
I am Helian Zheng's foster father,

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,360
Zhao Zhiqian.

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,200
Nice to meet you,

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
Miss He.

117
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
I've been wanting

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,960
to have a good chat with you.

119
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Anran.

120
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Anran!

121
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
Anran.

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,280
Anran.

123
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Anran, Anran.

124
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Helian Zheng...

125
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,840
You're finally back.

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Anran!

127
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,990
Who was it?

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Governor, it was the commander.

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,920
He forced her to sign a divorce agreement

130
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,520
and hand over the gold mine map.

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,600
She refused,

132
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,880
saying she would never leave you

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,480
unless you asked for a divorce.

134
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,800
The commander was furious
and punished her.

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
Where is the commander?

136
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
He's back.

137
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Anran.

138
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll go find Zhao Zhiqian.

139
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,240
She shouldn't suffer unfairly.

140
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,160
He Anran is my wife.

141
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
Whoever bullies her is my enemy.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Even if that person is you, father.

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,280
You're actually questioning me

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,640
for the sake of a woman.

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,360
She almost got you killed by poisoning,

146
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
yet you still defend her like this.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
You can do whatever to me.

148
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,760
If you want the gold mine, I'll help you.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,640
But you cannot harm He Anran.

150
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,760
She's the woman I love most.

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Helian Zheng.

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,280
How dare you speak to me like this!

153
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,760
If you harm her again,

154
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,880
I'll cut ties with you.

155
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
Who told you to apply meds yourself?

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
Don't force yourself when you shouldn't.

157
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,640
All I can think about now is

158
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,840
how to heal your wound.

159
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
I have no other thoughts.

160
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,200
You don't need to overthink.

161
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm not overthinking.

162
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
If it hurts,

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,840
you can cry out.

164
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,080
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
I didn't take care of you.

166
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
Did he...

167
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,840
treat you like this too?

168
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
I'm lucky.

169
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,960
I've fought my way out of
the dead several times.

170
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,400
He saw my value,

171
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
and took me as his foster son.

172
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
But I know,

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
once I'm no longer useful,

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,920
he'll just kick me out.

175
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,360
So I fought for the governor's position,

176
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
to make sure no one

177
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,000
can betray me easily.

178
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
All these years,

179
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,440
you've been through so much.

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,060
Many struggle to get by.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm lucky.

182
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
These few days,

183
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,480
rest well and recover.

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,760
Helian Zheng.

185
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,240
Can I ask for your help

186
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
to investigate a man named Li Yang?

187
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,670
My father said

188
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,760
he arranged the bandit job
for the He family.

189
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,640
I'm already investigating.

190
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,760
Don't worry.

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
Take care of yourself.

192
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,080
Leave the rest to me.

193
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,760
Go to sleep.

194
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,080
(You used to care for me like this too.)

195
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,560
(Back then, I thought it would be forever.)

196
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,260
(Helian Zheng)

197
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,300
(Meeting Minutes)

198
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,040
Give me the most urgent first.

199
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
Sort the rest by priority.

200
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
I'll handle them one by one.

201
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,430
Governor,

202
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,700
you've barely slept for days

203
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,960
taking care of Madam.

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
And you're still injured.

205
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,680
My injury is long healed.

206
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,920
Go investigate

207
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
Tang's connections.

208
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,920
He established himself

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
in both black and white,

210
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,280
which shows his strong abilities.

211
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
But I'm still worried

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
he might be used by others.

213
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,200
Any news on Li Yang?

214
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,320
Yes, Governor.

215
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,440
The assassin who attacked Madam
is related to him.

216
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480
As you suspected, Li Yang was the employer.

217
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,900
He also bought up all the antidotes.

218
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,580
Unfortunately, when we found him,

219
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,680
he was already dead.

220
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,560
I guess maybe...

221
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,420
(Archive)

222
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,720
No need to guess.

223
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,240
His matter is likely related
to my foster father.

224
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,920
Keep following this lead.

225
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,040
Don't alert anyone.

226
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,680
Also,

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,400
have you prepared the things

228
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
I asked for by date?

229
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
Yes.

230
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,880
You may leave.

231
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,800
Lieutenant Li,

232
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,360
why do you have to handle the laundry?

233
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,680
You misunderstood.

234
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,900
The governor prepared these
for the refugees.

235
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,040
It's been snowy lately.

236
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,800
He fears some might freeze to death,

237
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,280
so he prepared these cotton clothes

238
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,880
and found temporary shelters.

239
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,440
These are just samples.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,440
These are made with thick cotton.

241
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,720
If all the city's refugees are counted,

242
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,680
can the Helian Family handle it?

243
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,080
It can't.

244
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,880
That's why he keeps patching things up.

245
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,920
(He's still the same as before,)

246
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,120
(bearing everything alone.)

247
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,120
(This time,)

248
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,480
(I should help him.)
