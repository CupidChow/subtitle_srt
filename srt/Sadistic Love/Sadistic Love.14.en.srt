00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,000
Governor,

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,520
if we provide both porridge and medical aid,

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,800
our supplies won't suffice.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,240
Moreover,

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,760
the new refugee settlement is also an issue.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
Open the soldier's training ground,

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,440
and place the refugees there for now.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Use the budget from the Governor's Mansion.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,960
But our expenses are already...

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,920
I'll find a way.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Give me the water.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,560
Go ahead.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,600
The Chu Family

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,580
is willing to help the refugees.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,800
After all, such acts that build public trust

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,600
shouldn't be monopolized by you alone.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,760
I'll remember your kindness today.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,360
I'll repay it.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,640
Thank you.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,440
Helian Zheng,

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,160
I want to talk to you.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,560
Mr. He has returned home now.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,600
What's your plan with Anran?

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,440
This is my personal matter.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
I don't need outsiders to interfere.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
I just want to know your feelings about her.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
This will determine

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,600
whether I should tell you a secret.

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
He Anran is my wife.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,040
In my lifetime,

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
I'll never let her go.

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,960
When Mr. He found out about you two,

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
he insisted on driving you away.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
Anran, to keep you there,

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
was forced to agree to meet me.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,280
Later, she confessed to me,

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,860
saying that she would never

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,600
marry anyone else in this lifetime.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
Though I'm reluctant

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
to admit it,

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,520
I don't even qualify as your rival in love.

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,440
What were you talking about?

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Nothing.

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
Just some usual conversations.

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Ming'an and I...

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
Anran,

60
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,400
you must be exhausted today.

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,360
Come up, I'll carry you.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Take a look.

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
Sir,

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,520
following the style of this merit ring,

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,080
make an exact copy for me

66
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,480
as soon as possible.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,760
The materials must be precisely the same.

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
This must remain a secret from everyone

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,960
to avoid causing any unnecessary trouble.

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,760
No problem.

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,000
How's your brother-in-law lately?

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Five years ago,

73
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,560
a concubine in our family died.

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,360
He helped with the autopsy,
proving it was suicide.

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,580
Help me arrange a meeting.

76
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,680
Let's have tea together.

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,440
Thanks for thinking about us.

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
I'll pass the message along.

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,040
Let's not delay, get to work quickly.

80
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
Alright.

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Goodbye.

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,080
Hello?

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
Anran.

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,600
What?

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880
You want to hand over the key to the mine.

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,640
(So you've kept it all along.)

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
(I misunderstood)

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,040
(that you already discarded our token.)

89
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880

waiting for me to carry you?

93
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
Who said I'm not asleep?

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,360
I just woke up now.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Thank you.

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,120
I can handle this minor injury myself.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760

Because I trust you.

105

To settle so many refugees,

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,160
you'll need funds.

fell into the bandits' hands.

163

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
deliver a message,

165
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,520
demanding you to go to

166

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,920
Otherwise,

168
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,440
no orphan will survive.

169
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,680
Prepare explosives from the armory.

170
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,520
Place them around the warehouse.

171
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,580
Governor, you mustn't.

172
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,120
These explosives are more powerful
than before.

173
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
Once I rescue the orphans,

174
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,280
I'll detonate the explosives.

175
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,560

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
Zhao Zhiqian has taken action.

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,880
He Anran has also been taken
to the warehouse.

180
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,000

The Helian Zheng I know

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,040
is definitely not foolish.

186
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,720

189
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,040
