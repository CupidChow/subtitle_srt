00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
Ming'an, what brings you here?

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,940
Didn't I say I'd come to see you?

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,460
I brought you a gift

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,620
you'd really like.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,100
(That guy really covets Anran.)

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,180
This is a new design
by a British designer.

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,020
It suits you well.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,020
This is too extravagant.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,460
My wife

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,660
already has her favorite jewelry.

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,100
Mr. Chu, please give it to someone else.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,340
I can satisfy

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,820
her material needs.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,260
What about spiritual needs?

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,180
Anran and I grew up together.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,860
Since childhood,

30
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,540
we've loved the same book.

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,660
What about you?

He Anran,

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,620
you are my wife.

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,620
You are destined
to stay with me forever.

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,620
Helian Zheng.

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,660
Mr. Chu.

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,020
Do you still want to watch?

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,260
This is a daily amusement

43
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,980
between Anran and me.

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,050
Helian Zheng.

45
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,900
And you,

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,020
you'll never have such a chance.

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,880
Helian Zheng.

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,260
You can't even think about it.

49
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,420
Shameless!

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,340
She is your sister.

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,620
So what?

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,660
Anran!

53
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,260
- Let go.
- We're married.

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,520
We're destined
to be together forever.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
Let go of me.

56
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
Lieutenant Li,

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,140
see him out.

58
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,780
Mr. Chu, this way.

59
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,220
No need.

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,660
I'll leave by myself.

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,740
Ming'an, I...

62
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,020
Helian Zheng.

63
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,540
Helian Zheng,

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,860
must you humiliate me
in front of others?

65
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,780
Humiliate?

66
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,940
He Anran.

67
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,820
If you think this is humiliation,

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,900
it's far too lenient.

69
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,540
Let go of me.

70
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,820
Listen,

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,540
it doesn't have to be you.

72
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,820
Lieutenant Li, invite Miss Wen over.

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,520
The servants have the day off.

74
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,020
Anran will personally entertain.

75
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,820
Didn't you say no more matchmaking?

76
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,660
Why should I listen to you?

77
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,820
If you want your father
to be comfortable in jail,

78
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,860
you'd better behave.

79
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,380
Have a seat.

81
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,940
Your presence is an honor.

82
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,180
It's worth waiting.

83
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
We just received some new tea.

84
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,300
Would you like to try some?

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,100
Serve the tea.

86
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,460
If it's your command,

87
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,700
and it pleases you,

88
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,780
then I shall comply.

89
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,820
Governor, who is this lady?

90
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,020
She's insignificant.

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,820
You can ask her to do anything.

92
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,340
Today, meeting with you,

93
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,540
I specially tailored a dress.

94
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,540
How does it look on me?

95
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,260
Any dress

96
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,020
looks good on you.

97
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,620
But I think it's missing something.

98
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
The coat this lady is wearing

99
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,300
matches me quite well.

100
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,220
If you like it,

101
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,860
she can take it off.

102
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,580
Take it off.

103
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,980
I won't defy your order.

104
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,820
Forget it.

105
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,380
Upon closer look,

106
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,660
it's just ordinary.

107
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,860
It's about who the clothes are worn by,

108
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,300
not about who looks good in the clothes.

109
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,500
Governor, this maid is quite unique.

110
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Please pour the tea.

111
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,700
Why is this maid so clumsy?

112
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,220
Can't even pour tea properly.

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,580
Governor,

114
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,260
please find someone smarter to serve.

115
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,180
Oh, I almost forgot,

116
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,300
the servants are off today.

117
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,420
I'll ask Lieutenant Li to come over.

118
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,500
What?

119
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,460
Are you not satisfied yet?

120
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,940
Or have you thought of

121
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,220
new ways to insult me?

122
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,060
Today's meeting with you was quite sudden.

123
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,140
Recently,

124
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,860
the affair between you two
has made city news.

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,780
I don't know

126
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,140
why Mr. Zhao arranged this meeting.

127
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,420
But seeing your wife today

128
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,660
makes me realize that she's unique.

129
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,420
It satisfies my curiosity.

130
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm using you like this.

131
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,660
Aren't you angry?

132
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,980
I hate these family marriage arrangements.

133
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,500
I have someone I like.

134
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,580
But next time you need a prop,

135
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
you can reach out to me.

136
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,140
(Giving me away to someone else.)

(do you really not care at all?)

139
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,340
I threw away your book.

140
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,780
I bought you a new one.

Ming'an.

173
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,360
See you at the studio tomorrow.

174
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,020
Come in.

175
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,020
Governor,

176
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,700
this is the key to the annex.

177
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,820
Tang always wanted a home.

178
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,980
I can finally provide him one.

179
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,100
Governor, you really value commitment.

180
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,340
Tang is my only family

181
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,420
in this world.

182
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm also grateful to heaven

183
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,300
for giving me such a pure and kind brother.

184
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,340
May he remain pure and kind

185
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,260
no matter what he goes through.

186
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,500

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820

189
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,060

Keep your voice down.

193
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,820
Don't disturb Anran.

194
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,620
- Yes.
- You can leave.

195
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,180
Brother,

196
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,520
when can we

197
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,940
have our own home?

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,940
We will.

199
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,860
Mother,

200
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,620
I've finally found my brother.

201
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,220
(I've also found Anran.)

202
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
(I will strive to give her a real home.)

203
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,660
Tang,

204
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,540
the key to the annex.

205
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,140
You are the sole owner.

206
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,720
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

207
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,620
Don't turn me down.

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,340
Okay.

209
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,740
(You remember)

210
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,580
(I wanted a home.)

211
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,860
Tang.

212
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,100
I've always wanted to ask you,

213
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,180
do you just want to stay in this theater

214
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,660
and not go out to see the world?

215
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,060
What's the difference?

216
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,900
On this small stage,

217
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,140
I can sing of the world's sorrows

218
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,980
and partings.

219
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,620
There's one thing

220
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,940
that freeze time

221
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,380
and record our lives.

222
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,060
What is it?

223
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,980
Come in.

224
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,380
Coming.

225
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,460
Tang.

226
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,780
What is this?

227
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,620
It's a camera.

228
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,300
Since we reunited,

229
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,300
we haven't taken a photo.

230
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,060
Let's take a picture.

231
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,990
- Let's go on stage
- Come on.

232
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
as a memory.

233
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,340
I won't come back after this.

234
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,780
