=Episode 9=

11
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,159
The murderer was cut
on the right arm last night.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,598
As long as Miss Du lets
everyone check her arm,

13
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,399
the truth will naturally come to light.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,558
Impossible.

15
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,959
You don't even have evidence,
yet you dare to accuse randomly.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,038
Yuze is right.

17
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,199
I have status and reputation in Hu City.

18
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,758
You can't check at will.

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,558
If word spreads, how will I face people?

20
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,358
Since you refuse to cooperate,

21
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,519
then don't blame me for using force.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,079
Guards, search her!

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,680
Yes.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,759
- What are you doing?
- Don't come near, let go!

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,919
Let go of me!

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Chief, nothing found.

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,920
I'll shoot you dead!

28
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,278
Wu Peirong, you're courting death!

29
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,359
Enough!

30
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,038
Chief Wu is only doing his duty.

31
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,759
Besides, Miss Du struck first.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,758
Chief Wu.

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,439
Please, for my sake,
let this matter go today.

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,598
Don't hold it against them.

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,479
I will personally come
to apologize another day.

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,879
Let's go!

37
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,079
Since Youmeng moved
into the Pei Residence,

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
she has been slandered
and framed repeatedly.

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Only because people bully her
for being alone.

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,000
I've decided

41
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,439
to marry Youmeng in the coming days.

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,879
Make her officially my wife.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
You...

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,120
Then,

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,959
we will truly be one family.

46
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,319
You...

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,479
This woman is full of lies,

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,278
her behavior is shameless and improper.

49
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,999
Since she came to Hu City,

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,160
our entire Pei household
has been thrown into chaos.

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,439
Such a woman cannot
enter Pei Residence's gate.

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,800
Since childhood,

53
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,119
I've never fought with you for anything.

54
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,639
But I am determined

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,760
to marry Youmeng.

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,118
You...

57
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,278
What a disgrace to the family!

58
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,919
A disgrace to the family!

59
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,399
Wen Yuan said
Jin Se's wound has been treated.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
You need not worry.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,239
We should suspend our actions for now.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
Let Jin Se recover well.

63
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,319
By the way, you acted well today.

64
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,598
You actually surprised me a little.

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,239
Even I was startled.

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,600
Pei Yuze.

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,280
You suddenly said you'd marry today,

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,560
was it on a whim

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
or long planned?

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,120
Which one do you hope it is?

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,480
Is this also part of the plan,

72
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,959
or

73
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,599
do you truly want to marry me?

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,040
What are you doing?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't move.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,239
Alright, stop sulking
like a childish kid.

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
It demeans your status.

78
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,798
That wench dared to strike me,

79
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,039
and that doomed wretch

80
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,278
thinks that by clinging
to Hu City's elite,

81
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,239
he can rise with them.

82
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,358
Once our business
in Jiang City is stable,

83
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,719
what are these people in Hu City worth?

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,680
By then,

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,999
whether they live or die is up to us.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Shut up, how can Jiang City matters
be discussed so casually?

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,118
Alright, I know.

88
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,999
I won't leak anything.

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,000
So now,
we just let the second branch go?

90
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,679
Since that night it wasn't Du Youmeng,

91
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:32,239
then the one targeting us
must be someone else.

92
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,159
Find out who it is quickly.

93
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,879
We cannot delay the major plans ahead.

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Yes.

95
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,920
Godfather.

96
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,018
I need to go to Jiang City
for some business.

97
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,200
During this time,
keep a close watch on the second branch.

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,358
Don't let them stir up trouble.

99
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,318
Godfather, rest assured.

100
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,199
Uncle Yuze doesn't have
much time left anyway.

101
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,598
As for Du Youmeng,

102
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,598
I've seen plenty of women like her
who cling to powerful men.

103
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,798
Once Uncle Yuze dies,

104
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,679
she won't gain anything
in the Pei family.

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,800
Naturally, she'll go hunt
for another man.

106
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,520
Let's hope so.

107
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,359
(Aside from you and me in this world,)

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,959
(no one knows that Lian Chen
is already dead.)

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,960
(No one knows we killed
Lian Chen and Jiang Mingcheng.)

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,920
Pei Yujie left
for Jiang City last night.

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,519
Jiang City again.

112
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,598
We've only been in Hu City

113
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,159
for just a few months, Pei Yujie has already
gone to Jiang City three times.

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,159
The Pei family doesn't even
have much business with Jiang City.

115
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,120
Wen Yuan has already found some clues.

116
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,360
We should have solid news soon.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,280
I won.

118
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,558
Second Master,
there's a letter at the door.

119
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,599
Please take a look.

120
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,340
(Warehouses in Jiang City suburbs
massively acquired by mysterious tycoon)

121
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,919
Seems Jiang City

122
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,639
has something big going on.

123
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,639
Let's go take a look tonight.

124
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
No rush.

125
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,920
Today we

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
have something more important to do.

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,940
(Maoyuan House
Rui'anxiang Ginseng & Herbs Shop)

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Second Master, Miss Du.

129
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
What an honor.

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,278
I'm here to pick up the custom dress.

131
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,358
Oh, I almost forgot.

132
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,159
Wait a moment, I'll fetch it right away.

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
What dress?

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,479
Aren't we getting married?

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,840
Of course we need to prepare.

136
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,518
So soon?

137
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,879
I already made bold claims
in front of Pei Yujie.

138
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
This wedding has to be held.

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,399
Miss Du.

140
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,519
Let's go try it on.

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,160
Second Master, please wait here.

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,760
Pei Yuze, come inside for a moment.

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Why not wear it out to show?

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
I can just show you directly.

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,079
Since you've seen it,

146
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,079
I'll change back.

147
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,799
You go out first.

148
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,999
But I haven't seen enough.

149
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,960
You look very good in white.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,640
Boss, I'm here to pick up
Xueshan's dress.

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,039
Mr. Jiang, what a coincidence.

152
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,319
Second Master and Miss Du are also here.
Please wait, I'll fetch it for you.

153
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,119
Since it's our wedding,

154
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:44,879
why didn't you order one
for yourself too?

155
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,120
I'll order it for you.

156
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,760
Pei Yuze.

157
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,519
Don't you think

158
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,479
you should control yourself a little?

159
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
What?

160
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,880
Control your breathing

161
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,839
and your heartbeat.

162
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,280
This way,

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
I can hear even more clearly.

00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:03,198
Take a guess.

170
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,239
What are you doing?

171

Let's go.

173
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,159
Have the boss check
if the dress looks good.

174
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,880
Mr. Jiang.

175
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,519

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,559
I couldn't help it.

to turn your photo into a poster

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
and hang it at my shop's entrance?

186
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,959
- No way.
- No way.

187
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,278
Why so happy?

188
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,479
I used your money to buy my dress,
of course I'm happy.

189
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,239
Don't move.

190
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,400
I stepped on it.

191
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,919
What do you mean?

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
Haven't you heard?

193
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,119
If you step on someone's shadow,

194
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,718
it means you've trapped them.

195
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,799
So now, you're trapped by me.

196
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,639
Hey, don't move, let me step on it.

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,999
- Then I'll step on you too.
- Don't step on me.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
You, don't move.

199
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,479
Don't move.

200
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,400
Don't run.

201
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,680
Jiao Jiao.

202
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,520
Jiao Jiao.

203
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
That's great.

204
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,479
Xinruo is still alive.

205
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,400
I treated her so badly before,

206
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,719
and even insulted her,

207
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,519
I even joined hands with Pei Yujie

208
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,919
to swallow up the Lian family.

209
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,560
She must hate me so much.

210
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,919
What should I do?

211
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Help her bring down Pei Yujie.

212
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
It's not too late.

213
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,679
Xinruo will definitely come back to me.

214
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,520
Definitely.
