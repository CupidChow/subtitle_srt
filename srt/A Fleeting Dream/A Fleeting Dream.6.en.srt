11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,598
Miss, what's wrong?

12
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,439
Lian...

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Where's Lian Xinruo?

14
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,239
No, Du Youmeng.

15
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,199
Miss, what are you talking about?

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,479
Miss Du hasn't been here today.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,040
No, I saw her.

18
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,279
I knew she had been here.

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,439
Miss?

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,720
Miss, where are you going?

21
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,879
Miss Xinruo.

22
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,159
Xinruo?

23
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,319
Xinruo?

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,480
Xin...

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,280
Second Master, what's wrong?

26
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,119
She is fine.

27
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,519
Once you're back, adapt as needed.

28
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,119
Understood.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,520
Second Master, Mr. Jiang,
they've found Miss Lian.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,558
Thank you so much, boss.

31
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,799
Xinruo.

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,480
Yuze.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,960
You're not hurt, are you?

34
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,239
I'm glad you're alright.

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,199
Wenyuan said Miss Lian
was caught in a gang shootout.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,360
I wonder how she managed to escape.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,040
Xinruo barely made it out alive.

38
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,039
Why does it sound like
you are questioning her?

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,200
You misunderstood.

40
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,439
I was only worried about Xinruo.

41
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,879
Let me announce it.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't stop me. Step aside.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,759
Fine, you wretch.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,440
How dare you play tricks
and try to scare me!

45
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,879
Lian Xinya.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,719
Miss Xinya.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,719
What do you mean by that?

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,079
Did you actually see Xinruo tonight?

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,959
Yes.

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Cousin, I never went
to the Lian residence.

51
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,278
Why are you framing me?

52
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,879
Stop arguing.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,959
I saw you today.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,439
If you really don't believe me,

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,640
ask the boss yourself.

56
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:24,879
That's right.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,319
The young lady has been
in my shop all evening.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,599
Miss,

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,159
we're about to close.

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,758
Boss, I'm the fiancée
of Second Master Pei.

61
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,838
Please take my token
and run to the Pei residence.

62
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,039
You'll be well rewarded.

63
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,399
She looked so frightened
that I took the seal

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,399
and went to the Pei residence

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,320
so they could bring her back.

66
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,959
Thank you, sir.

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,639
I'll come by another day
to express my gratitude.

68
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,558
Don't mention it, Second Master.

69
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,679
Who knows if you two planned this?

70
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,559
When the boss went to
the Pei residence with the message,

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,999
did any other workers see Miss Xinruo?

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,559
Yes.

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,399
Everyone in the shop can testify

74
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,680
that she never left.

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,320
Xinruo,

76
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,959
you've had a long day.

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,280
Get some rest.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,679
Stop right there.

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
Lian Xinya.

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,999
I won't warn you again.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
You'd better learn your lesson.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
You...

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,639
What happened this afternoon?

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,159
A group of policemen attacked me.

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
Luckily, Jin Se showed up in time.

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,159
Good.

87
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,280
Wait here a moment.

88
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,479
After that, I had Jin Se
impersonate me and go to

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,679
the tailor shop
while I went to the Lian residence.

90
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
Pei Yuze.

91
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
What's wrong?

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,879
Pei Yuze!

93
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,639
Pei Yuze!

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,800
Pei Yuze!

95
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,560
Pei Yuze!

96
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,999
I'm fine.

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,518
Just low blood sugar.
Can you get me a glass of water?

98
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,479
Sure.

99
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Here.

100
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,039
Thank you.

101
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,479
You've had a long day.

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,038
Go get some rest.

103
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,039
I'm not tired.

104
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,199
I was just thinking
of grabbing some food in the kitchen.

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
Do you want to join me?

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,920
Sure.

107
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,279
Drink some water.

108
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,038
Hurry, the boat's almost here.

109
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,439
Move faster.

110
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,120
Careful.

111
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,838
If you break it, you can't even pay up!

112
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,879
Miss, bad news!

113
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,118
Several stewards just reported

114
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,399
that all the stored tea has gone damp.

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,680
How could that be?

116
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,598
Today is the shipping day.

117
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,838
Miss, what do we do now?

118
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,799
If we can't deliver on time,
we'll have to pay compensation.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,280
Pei Yuze.

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,879
Second Master, because of the tea,
Lian Xinya is in a panic.

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,558
She even went to ask Pei Yujie for help.

122
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,558
To keep the Lian family calm,

123
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,239
Pei Yujie had no choice
but to cover the loss.

124
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
He's taken plenty
from the Lian family over the years.

125
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,080
This is nothing in comparison.

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,418
This morning, Lian Xinya even
tried to move her private assets.

127
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:19,640
As soon as the boat was loaded,

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,880
I had someone switch them
and bring everything back.

129
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,879
Check the inventory.
Set some aside to reward the men.

130
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,840
Got it.

131
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,679
Second Master,
I still have things to do.

132
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
I'll head off.

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,440
What is it?

134
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,318
You look so pale.

135
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,119
Pei Yuze, are you
hiding something from me?

136
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,679
Why would you think that?

137
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,798
I've asked
several doctors about this pill.

138
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,959
None of them knows what it does.

139
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,558
I always thought
you were faking an illness.

140
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,838
Tell me the truth.

141
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,679
Are you really unwell?

142
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
So, you came here to question me.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,198
It's nothing more than a simple tonic.

144
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,199
A tonic?

145
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
What for?

146
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
It strengthens what's weak.

147
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,639
As for what's weak...

148
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,240
Do you want to check?

149
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
You...

150
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
What?

151
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
No need to check?

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
I still have work.

153
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,240
I'll tell you later tonight.

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,360
(I'll find out what this pill does.)

155
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,679
Who's there?

156
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,639
Who is it?

157
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,358
Miss, you're finally awake.

158
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,839
Did you have another nightmare?

159
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,079
Did I have a nightmare again?

160
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,919
Miss, you...

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,040
What are you...

162
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,678
Have you heard what happened

163
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,919
to the Lian family?

164
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes. Lian Xinya said she saw a ghost.

165
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,119
She is now out of her mind.

166
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,399
She shut herself
in the house to recover.

167
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:59,198
Strange how it all
happened right on cue.

168
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,959
Yao, do you really believe in ghosts?

169
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,079
I've never believed
in such superstition.

170
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,400
Someone likely pulled a trick on her.

171
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,719
Keep close watch on Du Youmeng.

172
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,479
If she has an alibi,

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,198
then someone must be helping her.

174
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,759
Find out who it is.

175
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,279
And tonight, go to the Lian Residence.

176
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,839
Understood.

177
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,158
How are things on your end?

178
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,079
Second Master and Miss Lian
went into the theater.

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,599
Second Master booked the whole place.

180
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Not sure when they'll be out.

181
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,879
Keep a close eye on them.

182
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,080
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

183
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,479
