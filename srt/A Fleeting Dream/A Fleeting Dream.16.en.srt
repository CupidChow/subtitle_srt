00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,919
Xinruo, hold me tight!

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,358
Pei Yuze, why am I here?

13
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,279
Stop talking and hold me tight.

14
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,279
Don't let go!

15
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:19,759
Yuze!

16
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,279
Xinruo!

17
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,719
Xinruo.

18
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,199
Second Master.

19
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,319
Xinruo.

20
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,999
Have some ginger soup.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,440
No thanks.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,320
I don't feel like eating.

23
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,719
Do you remember

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
what happened?

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,200
Come with me, okay?

26
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,879
Don't leave me alone.

27
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,879
Not at all.

28
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,279
I just remember I had a dream.

29
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:32,879
Then

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,360
when I came round,

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,400
I was in midair.

32
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,639
Could it be schizophrenia?

33
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,759
Xinruo suffers from schizophrenia?

34
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:45,359
But I hadn't had a relapse

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,360
ever since Pei Yujie's death.

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,760
Besides, I never had

37
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,959
such a serious relapse before.

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,720
I'm alright.

39
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,959
Xinruo.

40
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,359
That wasn't a relapse.
There's something wrong with this incense.

41
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,479
This isn't the mind-calming incense
that I usually use.

42
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,399
Though they smell similar,

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm sure they've been swapped.

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,160
I bet someone was in here

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
when you were asleep.

46
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,799
(Could it be Wu Peirong?)

47
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,479
I'll send someone to look into that.

48
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,039
Where have you been at this late hour?

49
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,038
I...

50
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,159
Jin Se

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,118
has gone missing.

52
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,879
Jin Se?

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,959
Calm down.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,360
I've asked Wen Yuan to look for her.

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,760
She fights well,

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,240
so she should be safe.

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
How crafty they are.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,879
They lured Jin Se away

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,039
and kidnapped you.

60
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,280
And now they pulled all this trick
in hospital without us knowing.

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
That should be Wu Peirong's doing.

62
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,598
But he's plotting something

63
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,679
behind our back.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,078
What do we do?

65
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
Unless...

66
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,519
we lure him out.

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,558
You can't blame for the failure. It was...

68
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,239
I told you to get rid of Pei Yuze,

69
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,600
not to hurt Xinruo!

70
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,160
They killed Mr. Pei.

71
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,879
I'm going to avenge him!

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,960
If you want
to leave Hu City in one piece,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
you'd better do as I say.

74
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,319
Following the failure,

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,959
I can't expose myself.

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,680
What can I do now?

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
What's this?

78
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,719
I want to see
Pei Yuze breathing his last.

79
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,060
(Pei Residence)

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,999
I've looked into all

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
who accessed the residence.

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,680
None of them is suspicious.

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,999
Haven't the police received any news
regarding Wu Peirong?

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,358
You suspect Wu Peirong
is behind all this?

85
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,118
Wu Peirong is the only one

86
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,719
who sees us as nemeses
and has tried to get rid of us.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,120
Xinruo, rest assured.

88
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,719
I'll have my men look into that.

89
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:40,719
Yuze!

90
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,558
Uncle Yuze!

91
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,879
Where's the medicine? Where...

92
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,039
Yuze!

93
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,318
Butler! Butler!

94
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,959
Quick, let's send him to hospital!

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,120
Traces of the venom were found
in his body.

96
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,920
Fortunately, it was nothing serious.
And he was sent here in no time.

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,039
He's out of danger now.

98
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
Venom?

99
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,639
Thank you, Doctor.

100
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,319
That's great! Uncle Yuze is all fine.

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Yao, what's the matter?

102
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,960
I was wondering why Uncle Yuze
was poisoned.

103
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,439
Jiang Yao. There have been misfortunes
in the Pei Residence.

104
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,079
As the head, you should look into it.

105
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,639
Xinruo, don't worry.

106
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,200
I won't let them get away with it.

107
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,359
I'm glad to hear that.

108
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Xinruo, we're off, then.

109
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,639
Yao, let's go.

110
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,300
(Pei Residence)

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,679
How can he be so lucky?

112
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,758
Even the poison failed to kill him.

113
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,038
Impossible.

114
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,119
He did take the soup!

115
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,118
How did he survive

116
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,119
such a big dosage?

117
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,038
I told you not to beat around the bush.

118
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,439
I'll head to hospital
and get rid of him now.

119
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,239
I'll kick him when he's down.

120
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,039
Could it be

121
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,919
he wasn't poisoned at all?

122
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,279
This is bad!

123
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't move! Put the knife down!

124
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,840
Put the knife down!

125
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,559
Pei Yuze.

126
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,239
Why weren't you poisoned?

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
Who said I was poisoned?

128
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,700
Was it someone from the Pei family
who has been in cahoots with you?

129
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,159
Someone from the Pei family?

130
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,679
I tried to kill you

131
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,719
to avenge Mr. Pei.

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,718
Come clean

133
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,799
and we'll consider sparing your life.

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,718
What do you want to know?

135
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,719
Who in the Pei family
is good at making poisons?

136
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,879
Making poisons?

137
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,599
How would I know that?

138
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,640
Who in the Pei family
has been in cahoots with you?

139
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,359
Him?

140
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,799
Wu Peirong? Why is he here?

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
Why are you here?

142
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,879
I got worried

143
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,960
because you weren't home yet.

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,680
We're asking Wu Peirong

145
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,279
who in the Pei family
he's in cahoots with.

146
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,679
Wu Peirong, speak!

147
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Is anyone from the Pei family
in cahoots with you?

148
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,919
I bought one of the bodyguards off.

149
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,559
I can tell you about him.

150
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,879
What about Jin Se? Where is she?

151
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,400
I don't know.

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
You're lying.

153
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,158
I just had my man lure her away.

154
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,079
And she ended up getting lost
in the woods.

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,758
You...

156
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,279
Since you refuse to cooperate with us...

157
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,919
Wen Yuan,
send him to the police station.

158
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,360
They have many tricks
to make him tell the truth.

159
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,640
Yes, Second Master.

160
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,239
Move!

161
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,400
Don't try anything funny!

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,820
(Pei Residence)

163
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
Thanks.

164
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,199
Are you really alright?

165
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,239
Don't worry.

166
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,920
Ordinary poisons don't work on me.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,599
By the right, what Wu Peirong said...

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,280
It was almost unbelievable.

169
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,079
Besides, Jiang Yao showed up
at a perfect timing.

170
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
So you mean

171
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,159
Wu Peirong has something
to do with Jiang Yao.

172
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,679
We can't be sure yet.

173
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,640
Let's see if Wu Peirong

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,280
can give us what we want.

175
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,638
How's it?

176
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,399
Master Jiang, Wu Peirong
said nothing yesterday.

177
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
However...

178
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,119
What?

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
He was taken away this early morning.

180
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,560
Got it.

181
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,159
What happened?

182
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,319
Wu Peirong has been taken away.

183
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,520
By whom?

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,160
We couldn't figure that out.

185
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
He must be

186
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,679
hiding something from us.

187
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:04,159
You almost ruined our plan
by trying to kill Pei Yuze on your own.

188
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:07,678
That useless Pei Yuze

189
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,079
thinks he can get the best of me.

190
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,218
I'll take the ferry to Japan tonight.

191
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,999
Once Hu City and the national chamber
of commerce are under your control,

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
I'll be back

193
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
to teach that shameless couple
a good lesson

194
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,719
and avenge Mr. Pei!

195
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,439
You haven't told anyone

196
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
about our deal, have you?

197
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,639
Rest assured.

198
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,798
You've saved me twice.

199
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,638
My lips are sealed.

200
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,639
Is that so?

201
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,320
If it hadn't been for me,

202
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm afraid
you'd have come clean to the police.

203
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,879
Because I believed

204
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,999
you'd get me out of there.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,840
I said those words to stall them.

206
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm glad to hear that.

207
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,919
The ferry is leaving soon.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,960
I need to go now.

209
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
You

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
actually...

211
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,200
