Who's that?

(Missing Person Notice)

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,720
A missing person notice?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,880
The Pei family posted
two notices at once.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,760
Something serious must have happened.

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,259
(Pei Xueshan, female, 23 years old,
generous rewards)

17

(Medical specialist wanted, family member
gravely ill, generous rewards)

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,100
(Pei Residence)

19
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,239
What do you think
Miss Lian is suffering from?

20
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,159
So many doctors have come
these past few days,

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,720
but none have been able to cure her.

22
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,719
Who knows?

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,840
Miss Xueshan is missing too.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,159
The Pei family has been having

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,720
nothing but trouble lately.

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,280
Miss Lian,
my medical skills aren't enough

27
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,719
to cure your illness.

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,200
You and Mr. Pei should seek
someone more competent.

29
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,719
Thank you.

30
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,559
See him out.

31
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,639
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,680
Any updates?

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,439
Our men have searched
the docks and bus stations

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,120
but haven't found Pei Xueshan yet.

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,758
Many saw the notices and claimed

36
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,038
they saw her around the city.

37
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,119
Seems like
she's still somewhere in Hu City.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,599
Looks like she's waiting
for me to die from poison.

39
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,919
We can't wait.
We're running out of time.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,639
Wen Yuan, I'm coming with you
this afternoon. We'll find her together.

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
No.

42
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,759
You're still weak.

43
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:32,999
You stay home.

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,358
Wen Yuan, let's go.

45
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,479
Yuze! Pei Yuze!

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,440
Second Master, what's wrong?

47
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,038
I'm fine. Let's continue the search.

48
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,239
No, Second Master.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
You must return and rest.

50
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,639
Search that area.

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
You two, follow me.

52
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:19,999
Pei Yuze! Pei Yuze! Wake up!

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,280
Someone! Anyone! Help!

54
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,119
Help!

55
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,060
(Pei Residence)

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Another funeral at the Pei Residence.

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,160
- What's going on with the Pei family?
- I wonder what's going on.

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,700
(Tablet of Beloved Husband Pei Yuze)

59
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,900
(Memorial)

60
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,840
Miss Lian, you haven't eaten all day.
You should inside and rest for a bit.

61
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,920
If the Second Master
saw you like this, he'd worry.

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,519
Envoy, I just received news.

63
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,759
Pei Yuze has died from poisoning.

64
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
Pei Xueshan.

65
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:17,759
You'd better reclaim control
of the Pei family this time.

66
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
Don't delay the general's plans.

67
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
Rest assured.

68
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,959
I won't let him down this time.

69
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,318
Remember your promise.

70
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,118
We plan to take action
one week from now.

71
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,159
Before that,

72
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,000
the Hu City Commander must die.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,359
And please keep your word

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,679
that once this is done,

75
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,680
you must help me become chairwoman
of the Southeast Chamber of Commerce.

76
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,020
(Pei Residence)

77
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,540
(Memorial)

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,880
Uncle Yuze,
you've always been frail and sickly.

79
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,280
Now, you're finally free.

80
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,679
I'm here to see you off.

81
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,639
Uncles.

82
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,719
Uncle Yuze passed before
he could officially become family head.

83
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,559
He left so suddenly.

84
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Have we chosen the new family head yet?

85
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,239
He left too soon.

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,079
The Pei family is now leaderless,

87
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
and we don't know what to do.

88
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,079
I think Miss Xueshan

89
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,319
would be a suitable candidate.

90
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,599
What did you say?

91
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,879
How could the Pei family
have a woman as head?

92
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,959
Times have changed.

93
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,198
What's wrong with a woman
leading the family?

94
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,199
That's right.

95
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,359
Third Granduncle, why don't you name

96
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,080
someone more capable than me?

97
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,079
The Pei family's...

98
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
No matter who you recommend,

99
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,318
I have ways to make them disappear.

100
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,399
You...

101
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,359
I, Pei Xueshan,
am capable and ambitious.

102
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,319
If I become the head of the Pei family,

103
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,759
I'll make the Pei family
a leading commercial empire

104
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,079
across the Southeast,
and even the whole country!

105
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,559
Uncles,

106
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,079
you should know

107
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,238
whom to choose by now.

108
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,399
I support Miss Xueshan.

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,439
I do too.

110
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,318
You...

111
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,839
Then, it's settled.

112
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,239
Not so fast.

113
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,079
Miss Xinruo.

114
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,519
Lian Xinruo, you're not even married
to Uncle Yuze yet.

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,999
What right does an outsider have
to interfere in the Pei family?

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,318
Ten years ago, you poisoned Yuze,

117
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,919
and now you collude with the Japanese

118
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,400
and used Jiang Yao to poison me.

119
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,680
There isn't a single thing you did
that wasn't unforgivable.

120
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,600
But it doesn't matter.

121
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,599
Since you dared come back,

122
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
you won't leave.

123
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,439
You've said a lot,
but do you have proof?

124
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,280
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,280
Give me the antidote.

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,839
What antidote?
I don't know what you're talking about.

127
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,599
Don't be fooled by Jiang Yao.

128
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,999
He was once devoted to you,

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,638
but you cast him aside.

130
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,559
Then, you got involved with Uncle Yuze

131
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,320
and made yourself his elder.

132
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,238
He poisoned you
out of love turned to hate.

133
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,119
It has nothing to do with me.

134
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,919
What do you want?

135
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,678
Answer my questions.

136
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,158
Don't try anything.

137
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,399
If you refuse,

138
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,680
I'll slash your face

139
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,198
until it's nothing but scars.

140
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,718
Lian Xinruo, if you dare hurt me
in front of all these people,

141
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,119
you won't get away with it!

142
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,159
So what if I hand it over?

143
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,879
Pei Yuze is already dead.

144
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,319
Who told you he's dead?

145
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,840
Wen Yuan, bring him out.

146
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,159
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,120
Lian Xinruo, you tricked me!

148
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,759
Wen Yuan!

149
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,359
Wen Yuan, are you all right?

150
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,759
Where is he?

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
Wen Yuan! Help!

152
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,039
Someone!

153
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:13,959
Miss Xinruo!

154
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
Miss Xinruo.

155
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,959
Get him to the hospital, now!

156
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,320
Call the doctor!

157
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:28,879
Did you see the Second Master?

158
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,198
Miss Lian, Mr. Jiang took
the Second Master away.

159
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,759
Which direction did they go?

160
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
That way.

161
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,940
(Rui'anxiang Ginseng & Herbs Shop)

162
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,759
Look at these hands.

163
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,520
They obviously belong to a spoiled
rich kid who's never done a day's work.

164
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,039
Now look at mine.

165
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,480
When I was born,

166
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,439
my father was just a poor bookkeeper.

167
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,080
We lived in a cramped attic

168
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,159
down a narrow lane.

169
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,160
For Chinese New Year,

170
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,319
we couldn't even afford new clothes.

171
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
The neighborhood kids laughed

172
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,120
and insulted us.

173
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,679
Later, my father earned
Mr. Lian's recognition

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,680
and we moved into the Lian Residence.

175
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,919
Our lives improved.

176
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,879
That was the happiest time of my life.

177
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,439
I never dreamed

178
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,720
Xinruo would agree to marry me.

179
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,520
After I graduated,

180
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,158
Xinruo was going to be my wife,

181
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,919
and I would become
the future head of the Lian family.

182
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,680
But then my father died.

183
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,759
Xinruo disappeared.

184
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,680
I lost everything again.

185
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,640
No.

186
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,999
I've already lost Xinruo.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,360
I won't go back to that dark,
damp, tiny attic ever again.

188
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,480
I'm going to climb higher.

189
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,359
I'm going to rise above them all.

190
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,679
Since I got engaged to Xueshan,

191
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,080
I've been walking on eggshells
around the Pei family,

192
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,879
enduring mockery and scorn.

193
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,520
I was on the verge of success.

194
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,120
But it's all because of you!

195
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,239
All of a sudden, you came back.

196
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,519
You didn't just steal Xinruo from me.

197
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,760
You took everything
that rightfully belonged to me.

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,960
The Pei family has all
deceived me, used me!

199
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,280
You all deserve to die!

200
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,079
If Xinruo saw you like this,

201
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,120
she'd be heartbroken.

202
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,559
You good-for-nothing fool.

203
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,039
Xinruo should only have feelings for me!

204
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,359
I'm the only one she should love!

205
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,959
Look.

206
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,300
(Tablet of Beloved Wife Lian Xinruo)

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,640
I've prepared everything.

208
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,160
Jiang Yao.

209
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,120
You've lost your mind.

210
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,319
Once Xinruo dies,

211
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,120
I'll join her.

212
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
We'll be buried together.

213
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,359
We'll never be apart again.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
And you...

215
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,300
(Tablets of Beloved Wife Lian Xinruo
and Beloved Husband Jiang Yao)

216
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,999
You filthy thing.

217
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
You don't deserve Xinruo.

218
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,479
I'll carve off every inch of your body

219
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,840
that touched her

220
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,839
and feed it

221
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,119
to the dogs.

222
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,479
Tell me, how should I kill you

223
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,080
so Xinruo hates me just a little more?

224
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,919
Coward, do it if you dare!

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yuze!

226
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm here to save you.

227
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,359
Xinruo, open your eyes!

228
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
He's our enemy!

229
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Let us go.

230
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,199
Xinruo,

231
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,318
the Pei family are all liars.

232
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,519
He'll hurt you.

233
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,880
Come with me. I'll take you away.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
We'll leave Hu City together, okay?

235
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:07,039
Come to your senses.

236
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,199
