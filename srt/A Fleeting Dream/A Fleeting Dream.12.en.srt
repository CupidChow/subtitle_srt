=Episode 12=

11
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,479
Du Youmeng.

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,838
Oh no, I should call you Lian Xinruo.

13
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:15,959
Pei Yujie.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,800
You asked me here.

15
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,639
Where are my father's remains?

16
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,479
The dying don't need to know that.

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,519
Get her.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,078
Second Master.

19
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,558
I'm worried Xinruo might be in trouble.

20
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,639
Let's hurry.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,520
Stop.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880
I'll shoot you dead.

23
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,838
Why are you here?

24
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,239
Pei Yujie took Wu Peirong's men

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,919
and headed for
the East Suburb Warehouse.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,719
Xinruo is in danger.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,639
Go save her.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,919
I'll clean up here.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,759
- Wen Yuan, take care of the tungsten.
- Got it.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,119
Trust me.
I'll get the tungsten to a safe place.

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,000
Lian Xinruo.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,879
Even after five years,

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,039
your skills have become so sharp.

34
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,719
I really underestimated you.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,520
Enough with the nonsense.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,679
Where did you hide my father's remains?

37
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,319
You must already know

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,118
what this is.

39
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:32,239
This is what's going to make me rich.

40
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,399
Back then, I kindly invited your father

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,879
to join the Jiang City business.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,160
But he flat-out refused me.

43
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,879
And once he learned my secret,

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,959
I couldn't let him live.

45
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,039
For your own selfish gain,

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,080
you didn't hesitate to take

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,439
another person's life?

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,159
You're truly vicious.

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,560
Did you kill Uncle Jiang too?

50
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,719
Him? He was just an accident.

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,079
He happened to be where he shouldn't

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,239
and heard what he shouldn't.

53
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,159
But there was one thing
I didn't lie about.

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Lian Chen's body is buried here.

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,479
And today, I'll bury you beside him.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,720
What a perfect ending, right?

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,120
You were waiting for her, weren't you?

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,598
Bring her in.

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,639
Move.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,839
Miss.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,200
Jin Se.

62
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,959
If not for the alert I got earlier,

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,600
I'd never have noticed this shadow.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,518
Now, who wins or loses

65
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,359
is anyone's guess.

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,399
Lian Xinruo, say your prayers.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,518
Miss!

68
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,559
Wait!

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
Xueshan.

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,118
Pei Yuze, how dare you.

71
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,799
She's your niece!

72
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,278
Father, save me!

73
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,439
Pei Yujie.

74
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,879
Let them go.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,959
You think I'd ruin my plans

76
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,920
for the sake of a girl?

77
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,319
Is that so?

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
If that's the case,

79
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,759
then I'll just have to be ruthless.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,159
Uncle, please don't kill me.

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,159
Father, save me!

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,320
Stop!

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,600
So, you aren't
as heartless as I thought.

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,400
Pei Yuze.

85
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,919
You and I are both Pei family.

86
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,399
Why let a woman

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,919
turn us against each other?

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,239
Release Xueshan

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,159
and I promise you

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,558
I'll let go of the past

91
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,758
and hand over the property
that belongs to you.

92
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,839
What do you say?

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,360
Enough with the nonsense.

94
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,079
Let her go.

95
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,679
Yujie, you can't!

96
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,640
Shut up.

97
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,719
You want me to let them go? Fine.

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,879
But you think you can trade one for two?

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,879
Dream on.

100
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,879
Free Jin Se first.

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,759
She's injured!

102
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,919
No, Second Master.

103
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,999
Save her first.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,080
Shut up.

105
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,760
Jin Se.

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,119
I have to save Youmeng first.

108
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,519
Pei Yuze!

109
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,280
It's alright, Second Master.
I understand.

110
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,399
Quiet.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,480
Pei Yujie.

112
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,318
How about I count to three,

113
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,239
and we release them together?

114
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,559
Fine.

115
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:08,519
One.

116
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,400
Two.

117
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,799
Three.

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,838
Pei Yuze, you really are cunning.

119
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,639
Takes one to know one.

120
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,319
But if you try any more tricks,

121
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,278
then I'll have no choice

122
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,399
but to cripple Xueshan's arm.

123
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,599
You...

124
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,080
One.

125
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,799
Two.

126
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,439
Three.

127
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400
Good.

128
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,999
Xueshan, come here!

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,080
Jin Se!

130
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,919
Pei Yujie!

131
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,399
Put the gun down.

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Hand over the antidote.

133
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,159
Antidote? What antidote?

134
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,039
Drop the act.

135
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,278
You know very well how you became

136
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,879
the family head.

137
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,038
So that's it.

138
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,719
Poisoned, are you?

139
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,360
Interesting.

140
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,760
Truly interesting.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,160
Pei Yujie.

142
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,919
Who else is involved
in the tungsten deal?

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,839
Stay out of this,

144
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,719
or you won't live to worry about it.

145
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,798
In that case, I'll kill you now

146
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,359
and avenge my father!

147
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,598
There's solid proof
of his murders and smuggling.

148
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,799
Hand him to the police.

149
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,999
No. I've waited long enough.

150
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,399
Pei Yuze.

151
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,199
Are you going to kill your brother?

152
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,558
Don't you fear heaven's wrath?

153
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,199
Miss Du.

154
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,078
Step aside.

155
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,839
Please, don't kill my father.

156
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,839
Shut up, woman! Die!

157
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
Yuze!

158
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,280
Yuze!

159
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Father!

160
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,639
Father!

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,880
Father!

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,680
Pei Yuze.

163
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,798
Hang in there.

164
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,519
I'll get you to the hospital.

165
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,199
It's alright.

166
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,639
I've known my time was ending.

167
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,519
I've been ready
to leave this world any moment.

168
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,999
Only...

169
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,879
After meeting you,

170
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,800
I started to cling to life.

171
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,919
Xinruo.

172
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,119
I realize now

173
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,000
that I've fallen for you.

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
I love you too.

175
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,838
Promise me,

176
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,279
for my sake,
you'll fight to live. Please?

177
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
I had planned

178
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,599
to place this on you at our wedding.

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
But I...

180
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,200
Xinruo.

181
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,879
Will you marry me?

182
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,919
I will.

183
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,719
Pei Yuze.

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Pei Yuze.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
Pei Yuze, wake up!

186
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,760
Pei Yuze!

187
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,399
Pei Yuze!

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
You're awake.

189
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
I'll get the doctor.

190
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,278
All his vitals are normal.

191
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,319
Luckily, the bullet
missed the vital organs.

192
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,039
A couple days' rest and he can leave.

193
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,400
Thank you, doctor.

194
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,120
See? Now you can relax.

195
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,798
The day they brought you in,

196
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,718
your wife cried her heart out.

197
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,399
She nearly
turned the hospital upside down.

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,718
She's been caring for you nonstop,

199
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,718
and lost so much weight.

200
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,798
Once you're better, go home.

201
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,879
Stop giving us trouble.

202
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,758
Since you're done checking him,

203
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,199
you should rest now.

204
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,240
I'll get out of your hair now.

205
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,879
I'll pour some water.

206
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,079
All that you said
that day at the warehouse,

207
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,440
does it still count?

208
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,519
What did I say?

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
I don't remember.

210
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,039
Trying to back out?

211
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,480
You didn't even put the ring on me,

212
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,719
and now you're blaming me
for backing out.

213
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,880
Then...

214
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,439
How about the wedding...

215
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh no.

216
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,560
I think I have sand in my eye.

217
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,319
Where? Let me see it.

218
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,360
Xinruo, can we talk?

219
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:12,439
