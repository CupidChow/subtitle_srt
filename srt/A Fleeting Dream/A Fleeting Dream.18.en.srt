11
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:16,679
Pei Yuze! Are you in there?

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Yuze!

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
What's wrong?

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,719
Take this, quickly!

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,600
What happened?

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,520
Yuze! Yuze!

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,038
Someone! Help! Help!

18
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,959
Anyone!

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,580
(Pei Residence)

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,200
Are you feeling better?

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm fine.

22
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,518
I'm sorry, Second Master.

23
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,038
If Miss Lian hadn't shown up
just in time,

24
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,679
I...

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
It's not your fault.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,720
Who was the one who drew you away?

27
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,959
I didn't get a good look.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,078
I only remember they moved
in a very unusual way.

29
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,399
I've never seen anyone like that.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
You've never seen them...

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,038
Didn't your poison act up not long ago?

32
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,479
Why did it happen again so soon?

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,720
The traveling doctor said the flare-ups
were getting more frequent, which means...

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,200
It's not the worst yet.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,920
Don't worry.

36
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,199
Where's your medicine?
Why didn't you have it on you?

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,320
Jiang Yao took it away.

38
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,639
Xinruo, I...

39
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,598
How could you do that, Jiang Yao?

40
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,639
We've spent so many years together.

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,118
You actually hit me because of Pei Yuze?

42
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,758
Look at the state you're in.

43
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,119
Are you still
the Jiang Yao I first knew?

44
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,639
I love you.

45
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,959
That hasn't changed.

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,520
I admit

47
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,758
I wanted Wu Peirong to kill Pei Yuze.

48
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,278
But I never intended to hurt you!

49
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,838
I don't want to hear any of this now.

50
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,078
I only have one question.

51
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,079
Where's Jin Se?

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,919
Jin Se? I don't know.

53
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,598
You're still denying it!

54
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,279
No, I really don't know.

55
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,318
Yuze never wanted to fight you
for the family head position.

56
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,199
It's your jealousy and hunger for power

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,159
that blinded you,

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,518
making him your imagined enemy.

59
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,639
You're pathetic.

60
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,919
I'm telling the truth.

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,080
Why won't you believe me?

62
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,199
You're not worthy.

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,278
Even sharing a roof with you right now

64
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,839
makes me sick.

65
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,500
(Pei Residence)

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,559
I had a doctor examine

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,879
the pills you gave me.

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,919
The doctor said
they're some sort of antidote.

69
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,758
An antidote?

70
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,879
For what kind of poison?

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,758
Not sure.

72
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,758
But those pills are incredibly strong.

73
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,639
It must be some deadly poison.

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,199
Got it. You may leave.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,240
Yes, sir.

76
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,440
So he was poisoned all along.

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,280
Then what was

78
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,239
all this for?

79
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
Miss Xueshan.

80
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,519
Dr. Fang, what brings you here?

81
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,078
I was foolish
and borrowed money for stocks.

82
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,838
The whole thing went underwater.

83
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,760
Can't you help me,
after all these years of doing favors for you?

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Help?

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,078
How?

86
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,239
Could you give me 50,000?

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,640
50,000?

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,040
Your appetite is a bit much, isn't it?

89
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,559
Miss Xueshan.

90
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,558
Don't forget

91
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,318
who covered for you in front
of the Second Master back then.

92
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,159
If you don't give me the money,

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
I'll have to go to him instead.

94
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,400
Fine.

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,960
I'll help you this once.

96
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,999
But only once.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,038
Thank you, Miss Xueshan.

98
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,319
Thank you.

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
For convenience,

100
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,639
I want that money as a check

101
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,319
plus a box of gold.

102
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
All right.

103
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,559
Thank you.

104
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:24,799
I'll take my leave now.

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,519
Second Master, I found a letter for you

106
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,879
in the mailbox.

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,679
We just returned
to the Lian Residence last night.

108
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
How did someone find out so quickly?

109
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,220
(Meet me at Leshan Hall, western woods)

110
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,300
(Meet me at Leshan Hall, western woods,
4PM, learn the truth of your poisoning.)

111
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,759
Here's what you wanted.

112
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,420
(Twenty-five thousand yuan only)

113
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,798
You're a lifesaver, Miss Xueshan.

114
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,199
I will keep this secret

115
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,558
and never tell anyone.

116
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,598
You better keep your word.

117
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:24,639
Rest assured.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,080
Not another soul will know about this.

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
Promises mean nothing.

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,240
Only the dead keep secrets.

121
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,719
Yuze, I can't shake this unease.

122
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,199
Do you think it might be a trap?

123
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,459
Don't worry. I've asked Wen Yuan
to set up an ambush nearby.

124
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,119
Whatever happens, we'll get out safe.

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:58,700
(Leshan Hall)

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Well?

127
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,279
The body still feels warm.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
He must have died recently.

129
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,719
If Dr. Fang sent us that letter,
then whoever killed him

130
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,559
is the real culprit

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,680
behind your poisoning.

132
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,599
Curses. After all this effort,
our lead is gone again.

133
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,520
Not a single reaction
after all this time. Boring.

134
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,199
You're as dull as Lian Xinruo.

135
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
I don't know what Jiang Yao sees in her.

136
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,319
Miss Xueshan.

137
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,239
Did you talk to anyone on the way?

138
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
No.

139
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,859
(Twenty-five thousand yuan only)

140
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,380
(Pei Xueshan)

141
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,639
Pei Xueshan?

142
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,520
Where's the check?

143
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,279
Where's the check? Where is it?

144
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:25,499
Find it and bring it back!

145
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:26,559
You bring back that check!

146
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,119
Yes.

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,600
And make sure to grind him to dust!

148
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,039
He dared to extort me!

149
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,759
They should all just die!

150
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
All of them!

151
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,879
He was already poisoned!
Why is he still alive?

152
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,278
And that Lian Xinruo!

153
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,999
She's always causing trouble!

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
She should die too!

155
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,999
You may not be fun,

156
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,280
but you're my last toy.

157
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

158
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,479
Once I control Hu City,

159
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Pei Yuze and Lian Xinruo
will keep you company.

160
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,559
Make sure she stays alive.

161
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,519
I was 17 when I was poisoned.

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,640
I barely spent any time
with Pei Xueshan.

163
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,719
That's why we never suspected her.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
But why would
she do something like this?

165
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,758
Of course,

166
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,198
just having a check

167
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,919
doesn't prove
she's linked to my poisoning.

168
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,639
I've already had someone watch her.

169
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,359
We'll know if she tries anything else.

170
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,320
We'll wait to hear from Wen Yuan too.

171
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,080
Pei Xueshan will definitely turn back
to look for the check

172
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,278
when she finds it missing.

173
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,439
We can follow that trail

174
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,160
to see if there's more to find.

175
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,199
Yes?

176
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,599
Got it.

177
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,880
Wen Yuan found something. Let's go.

178
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,680
This is bad. She can't die yet.

179
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,358
As you expected,

180
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,599
someone did turn back last night
looking for the check,

181
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
and I saw who it was.

182
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,879
It was the same man who lured me away

183
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,879
when Jiang Yao was trapped.

184
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,158
Have you found where he's hiding?

185
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,879
I followed him back to Hu City

186
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,399
but lost him nearby.

187
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,358
Oddly enough,

188
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,238
the guy following Pei Xueshan

189
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,238
said she was here
this afternoon as well.

190
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:54,079
He lost track of her
somewhere nearby too.

191
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,678
Their operations are secretive,

192
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,198
and all take place
somewhere around here.

193
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,759
There has to be something going on.

194
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,560
Jin Se! Jin Se!

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,120
Jin Se!

196
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,959
Are you sure you saw her?

197
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,838
I'm sure

198
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,519
it's her.

199
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,800
She even has a wound on her face.

200
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,800
- Let's split up and look for her.
- Okay.

201
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,700
(Restaurant)

202
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,759
Miss Xinruo!

203
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,759
Miss Xinruo! I'm here!

204
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,158
Jin Se!

205
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,199
I'm here, Miss Xinruo!

206
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,639
Jin Se, behind you!

207
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:58,879
