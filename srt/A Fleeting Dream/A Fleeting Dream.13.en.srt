=Episode 13=

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
I found this in Pei Yujie's study.

12
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:38,079
This might be
why he suddenly moved against us.

13
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,559
Xinruo.

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,200
I've known all along
it was Pei Yujie who killed my father.

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,080
The only reason
I stayed by his side for so many years

16
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,639
was to earn his trust,

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
and a chance to take revenge.

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,879
After learning who you really were,

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,759
I tried every way I could
to pass clues to you.

20
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,839
I treated you badly.

21
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,999
That was my fault.

22
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,639
I hope you can forgive me.

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,960
Don't say that.

24
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,079
If anything, we should be thanking you.

25
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,318
If it weren't for you,

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,239
we'd never have found the tungsten ore.

27
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,799
One more thing.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,358
When we cleaned up the scene,

29
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,439
we didn't find Wu Peirong's body.

30
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,199
You mean...

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,720
Wu Peirong might still be alive?

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm not sure.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,038
But don't worry.

34
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,319
Even if he is alive,

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
I'll keep you safe.

36
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,599
Jiang Yao.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,000
What happened between us...

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
is in the past.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,358
We were young then,

40
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,038
and didn't understand what love was.

41
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,399
Now that you have Xueshan,

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
you should cherish her.

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,280
Protect her.

44
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,598
I need to get some food for Yuze.

45
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,959
I'll go now.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,959
You've been sick for so long,

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,838
you shouldn't eat anything too heavy.

48
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:13,719
Start with some soup. Here.

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Just drink your soup.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,360
Why do you keep staring at me?

51
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,439
Pei Yuze, I'm warning you.

52
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,319
This is a hospital.

53
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,479
Stop with those messy thoughts
and behavior you always have.

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,439
And what do you think I'm thinking?

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,400
I...

56
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,119
Let's talk business.

57
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,879
I mentioned your poisoning
at the warehouse that day.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,560
But Pei Yujie's reacted
as if he knew nothing about it.

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
I noticed that too.

60
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,879
He admitted to every crime,

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
except that one.

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
If it really wasn't him,

63
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,999
then anyone who entered
the Pei family back then is a suspect.

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,159
But time is running out,

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,160
and we don't have the slightest lead.

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm at a loss here.

67
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,519
Don't worry.

68
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,598
Bad weeds live long.

69
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,319
I won't die that easily.

70
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,719
And I won't let you die, bad weed.

71
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,060
(Pei Residence)

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,720
(Memorial)

73
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,340
(In memory of Beloved Father Pei Yujie)

74
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,679
Move aside.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,719
Uncles.

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,000
Why are you here?

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,719
Pei Yujie committed treason for money.

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,318
He ruined the Pei family's name.

79
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,919
Now he's dead,

80
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,038
but the Pei family has become
rats everyone wants to kill.

81
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,118
I'm here today

82
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,838
to demand, on behalf of the family
and our branches, that we split up.

83
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,999
Third Uncle, this is a funeral hall.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,199
Show some restraint.

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,999
Shut your mouth. You're an outsider.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,399
Do not meddle in our family business.

87
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,879
You...

88
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,759
Yao!

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,840
Calm down.

90
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Uncles.

91
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,399
I'm not only my father's daughter.

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,960
I'm also part of the Pei family.

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,598
Of course I don't want us
to bring ruin to the family.

94
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,919
But the reason
we've had such prestige until now

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,919
is because
everyone in the family stood united,

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
supporting one another.

97
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,999
If we break apart
over a moment's hardship,

98
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,679
without the family's backing,

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,919
our shops will be swallowed up

100
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
sooner or later.

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,679
My father may have acted without honor,

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,199
but he ran
the Pei family for many years.

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,560
His ability spoke for itself.

104
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,078
Yao was the heir
my father trained with care.

105
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,359
His skill and courage are
no less than my father's.

106
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,880
I ask all of you to give us some time,

107
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,120
so Yao can prove he's able
to shoulder this family's duty.

108
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,719
Second Uncle, Xinruo.

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,280
My father did many wrongs in his life,

110
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
even bringing ruin to the Lian family.

111
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,960
I'm making this decision on my own.

112
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,118
I'll return
the Lian family's assets to Miss Lian.

113
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,799
And I'll gift her
several of my own properties

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,440
to atone for my father's sins.

115
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,159
Xinruo,

116
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:47,759
can you forgive us
for Second Uncle's sake?

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,959
What happened back then
wasn't your fault.

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Don't worry,
I won't hold it against you.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
What do you all think?

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,800
Then, we'll give you three months.

121
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,199
Let Jiang Yao act
as head of the family for now.

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,798
If he can't restored

123
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,079
the family's reputation
in three months,

124
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,040
then we'll have to choose another head.

125
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,479
Let's go.

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you, Third Granduncle.

127
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,180
(Pei Residence)

128
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,639
What's wrong?

129
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:50,999
Nothing.

130
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,759
Just this uneasy feeling I can't shake.

131
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,639
You've noticed something strange
about Pei Xueshan too, haven't you?

132
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,120
I have.

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,200
But I can't quite
put my finger on what it is.

134
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,600
Try looking at it another way.

135
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,559
If you were Pei Xueshan,

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,440
and your father

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,479
was killed right before your eyes,

138
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,718
even if it was revenge for a murder,

139
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,159
wouldn't you resent the killer?

140
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,639
I can understand her actions,

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,358
but I'd never easily forgive

142
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,079
someone who hurt my loved ones.

143
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,240
And yet, her kindness toward me
feels far too much.

144
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,360
With just a few words,

145
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,920
she sent the elders
demanding a split away.

146
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,999
She cleared the way
for Jiang Yao to become acting head,

147
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,319
and returned the Lian family's assets,

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,440
winning over the second branch.

149
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,959
She is nowhere near
as simple as she looks.

150
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,719
Second Uncle, you look much better.

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,039
Yao, did you
come to see me for something?

152
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes. I wanted to talk about Xinruo.

153
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,720
Xinruo?

154
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,520
You should be calling her Second Aunt.

155
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,999
No need to provoke me, Uncle.

156
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,638
I know you only pretended
to be engaged out of necessity.

157
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,358
Now that Xinruo has avenged her family,

158
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,759
you and she should both
return to your proper places.

159
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,359
You really are clever in your own mind.

160
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,239
Go on.

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,960
I hope you'll announce
the end of your engagement with her.

162
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,359
She shouldn't have to live

163
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,600
the rest of her life as your widow.

164
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:54,439
Yao,

165
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,280
tell me something.

166
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,600
In what capacity
are you discussing this with me?

167
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,599
Xinruo must have told you

168
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,599
my feud with Pei Yujie

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,718
and how Xinruo and I
were forced apart back then.

170
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,359
But I know neither of us
ever forgot the other.

171
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,319
Uncle, I can see you care for Xinruo.

172
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,959
But your days are numbered.

173
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,120
You can't give her a future.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,759
Instead of keeping her bound

175
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,359
for your own selfishness,

176
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,880
let her go free.

177
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,199
I see now.

178
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,200
You got engaged
to Xueshan for the headship.

179
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,599
Now that you're about to take power,

180
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,439
you want Xinruo too.

181
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,039
So, you're acting like the family head,

182
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
ordering me to end the engagement.

183
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,960
So when I'm gone,

184
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,919
you can enjoy both women.

185
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,798
Uncle,

186
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,559
that's not what I meant.

187
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,199
Isn't it?

188
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,519
You know the truth yourself.

189
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,279
Do you want to know

190
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
if Xinruo truly has me in her heart?

191
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,039
Yuze, what's wrong?

192
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,158
Are you feeling unwell?

193
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,879
I'm fine.

194
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,720
But you're coughing so hard!

195
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,239
Help me.

196
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,519
What are you waiting for?
Help me get him to his room.

197
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,600
Right.

198
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,559
Come on.

199
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Careful.

200
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,959
I'll get you some water.

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,080
Excuse me.

202
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,360
I told you.

203
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,479
You can't beat me.

204
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
You...

205
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,319
Here's your water.

206
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,638
Take your medicine.

207
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,959
Where do you keep it?

208
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,200
It's fine.

209
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,679
I just need to rest.

210
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,838
Xinruo, don't let him fool you!

211
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,359
He's faking it.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,320
Jiang Yao.

213
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,559
Get out.

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,359
Pei Yuze, you vile man.

215
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,199
Stand up!

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,399
Jiang Yao!

217
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,639
We'll talk outside.

218
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,159
Xinruo, don't believe him.

219
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,079
He's pretending

220
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,839
and alienating us.

221
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,039
He's not sick at all.

222
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,519
Yao, Yuze is weak.

223
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,439
Don't agitate him again.

224
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,919
Xinruo, no, he is...

225
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
Forget it.

226
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,679
Go handle your business.

227
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,999
Are you feeling better?

228
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,798
Much better. Don't worry.

229
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,039
If that's the case,

230
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,479
then I'll go talk with Yao a bit more.

231
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,519
You get some rest.

232
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,560
Wait.

233
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,519
Why did you stop acting?

234
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,838
Are you a child?

235
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,399
How could you pretend to be sick?

236
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,640
I was wrong.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Do you know how worried I was?

238
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,158
I thought your old injury flared up
or the poisoning set in.

239
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,798
My mind went blank.

240
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,559
I...

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,720
Why would you do that?

242
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
Why did I?

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,520
You really don't know?

244
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,599
Oh, right.

245
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,399
You distracted me so much that

246
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,200
I almost forgot the important matter.

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,079
I found a few folk remedies
for poisoning.

248
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,360
We can try them one by one.

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,678
No. I'm not going in.

250
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,119
No, I won't.

251
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,758
So,

252
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,318
what's the new treatment today?

253
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:19,559
This is a medicinal bath
prescribed by a renowned doctor.

254
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,120
It's supposed to cleanse toxins.

255
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,840
The water is just right.

256
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,720
Try it. I'll leave you to it.

257
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:31,278
It's a good bath here.

258
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,638
It'd be a shame if I enjoyed it alone.

259
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,359
Stop fooling around.
The water will get cold.

260
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
After all this trouble you caused me,

261
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,799
if you want my cooperation,

262
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:43,959
you'll have to pay some interest.

263
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
What interest?

264
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,759
Pei Yuze, you...

265
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,240
Where am I?

266
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,559
Where is this?

267
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,599
Somebody!

268
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,240
Somebody, help!

269
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,560
Help!

270
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,119
No! It can't be you!
