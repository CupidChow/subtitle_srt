11
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,078
Miss, a ticket sent by Madam Hou.

12
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,519
She said she wants you to attend.

13
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:17,799
Watch a movie?

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,360
Why is there only one ticket?

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,358
Where's Yuze's ticket?

16
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,399
Second Master...

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,399
Mainly, the audience is all ladies.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,119
It might be inconvenient for him to go.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,239
Wen Yuan.

(Yangpu Grand Theater)

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,000
It's okay, I got it.

22
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,439
Second Master.

23
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,519
Has the ticket been sent?

24
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,999
Yes.

25
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,039
Second Master.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,879
Since returning to Hu City,

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,919
you've been busy with Miss Du's matter.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,999
There's still no clue
about the antidote.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,439
Why don't we take advantage of Pei Yujie
going out and sneak into his room...

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
Alright.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,880
I can handle this.

32
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,679
Don't worry.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,960
The traveling doctor
asked me to remind you

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,118
there's only half a year left.

35
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,839
This time the dosage is increased.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,480
It might be a bit uncomfortable
to take it.

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
I got it.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
You go ahead.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,020
(Heroic Spirit Lasts Forever

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,360
Hey.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,519
What happened at home?

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,319
Miss Du, there's been a burglary.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,879
Go that way, you search over there.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay.

45
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,038
Wen Yuan, what are you doing here?

46
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,199
Go check over there!

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,120
Alright.

48
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,479
Someone! Something happened!

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,600
Over there!

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,680
Miss Du.

51
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,758
Someone just passed by there,

52
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,558
and scared me, go check quickly.

53
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,519
Chase!

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,640
Still not coming out?

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,959
Miss Du, you didn't go to the cinema?

56
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Do you take me for a fool?

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,038
What exactly happened?
How could you get hurt like this?

58
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,838
I sneaked into Pei Yujie's study room

59
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,479
and was accidentally discovered.

60
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,159
Why did you go to his study room?

61
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,239
His study room is heavily guarded
and there are many people on watch.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,959
Why did Yuze take the risk

63
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,479
and let you go there alone?

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
I acted without Second Master knowing.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,880
Miss Du, please don't tell him.

66
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,078
Why?

67
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,199
Tell the truth.

68
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,119
Not telling, huh?

69
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,479
I'll go ask him right now.

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
You can't go see him.

71
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,439
No, I mean, I...

72
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,959
I'm badly hurt.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,679
Could you please

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,118
help me get out?

75
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,479
You're hiding something from me.

76
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,439
Did something happen to Yuze?

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Tell me.

78
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,239
No, no way he...

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
Go check over there!

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
Leave through the back door.

81
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,640
Hurry!

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,800
Pei Yuze.

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
What's wrong?

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,358
Why are you back?

85
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,719
Are you feeling unwell?

86
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll call a doctor.

87
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
Don't!

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm fine.

89
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,119
You...

90
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,199
Just a little tired.

91
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,839
A nap will do.

92
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,240
Pei Yuze.

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
Pei Yuze.

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,280
How are you?

95
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,239
Don't worry, it's fine now.

96
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,199
Just a stomachache.
I'll be fine after taking some medicine.

97
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,160
How long are you planning
to keep deceiving me?

98
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,399
Or is it

99
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,479
that you don't trust me at all
in your heart?

100
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,798
Then what am I?

101
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,439
Am I just a pawn to you?

102
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,719
So I don't need to know anything, right?

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,520
If that's the case,

104
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,239
then I'll leave.

105
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,879
Don't go.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,520
I'll tell you everything.

107
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,120
I grew up in the ancestral house.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,280
When I was 16 years old,

109
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,559
my father fell gravely ill
and passed away.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,480
I then moved to Hu City
to live with Pei Yujie.

111
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,519
Before my father died, he left a will

112
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,239
that letting me inherit
the head of the family.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
But not long after,

114
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,399
I suddenly vomited blood and fainted.

115
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
So,

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,920
you were really sick.

117
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,199
At first, it was thought
to be an epidemic.

118
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,479
But after long investigation,

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
no treatment could be found.

120
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,560
The doctors even notified
the family to prepare my funeral.

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,598
Later, I happened to meet
a traveling doctor from Southwest China.

122
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,959
He suspected

123
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,919
that my food had been poisoned.

124
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,279
Did someone poison you?

125
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,758
Thanks to this traveling doctor making
medicine for me for over the years,

126
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,479
to suppress the toxin in my body.

127
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,599
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive today.

128
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,800
So the pills I discovered before

129
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,639
were medicines you used
to suppress the toxin.

130
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,558
When the toxin isn't active,

131
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,479
my body is like any normal person's.

132
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,439
I pretended to be sick

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,240
to make Pei Yujie lower his guard,

134
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,200
to make him think

135
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,798
I didn't know I was poisoned.

136
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,999
That's why you gave up
the family head position

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
and sought doctors everywhere,

138
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,279
while Pei Yujie naturally
became the new head of the family.

139
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,759
Truly wicked.

140
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,880
The traveling doctor's medicine

141
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,159
only suppresses the toxin in my body,

142
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,640
but cannot cure it completely.

143
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,559
But now my body

144
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,879
is increasingly resistant.

145
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,800
We must find the antidote
within six months.

146
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,039
Otherwise...

147
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
Otherwise...

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
You'll die?

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,598
This poison is strong,

150
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,519
but not entirely useless.

151
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,719
See, now ordinary poisons can't hurt me.

152
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,479
I can say

153
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
I'm immune to most toxins.

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,800
Pei Yuze.

155
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,040
We had a deal before.

156
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,199
You help me take revenge,

157
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,759
I'll help you achieve what you want.

158
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,040
We

159
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,559
can find the antidote together.

160
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,719
You'll be fine.

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,879
(Pei Residence)

162
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,400
The steward said there was a burglary
in the study room last night.

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,479
Though the thief wasn't caught,
fortunately nothing important was lost,

164
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,519
and no one was hurt.

165
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,519
What a relief.

166
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Yes, truly a foolish thief.

167
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,678
Why steal anywhere else, but the study room?

168
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,158
No wonder he returned empty-handed.

169
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,319
Yuze, don't you think so?

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,960
Indeed, a foolish thief.

171
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,680
The dishes are ready.

172
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,198
What a treat today.

173
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,079
Yao hasn't cooked in a long time.

174
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
Uncle Yuze, Miss Du, taste this.

175
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,439
Yao suddenly cooking,

176
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:23,278
is it some good news about Xueshan?

177
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,838
Uncle Yuze, don't joke.

178
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,238
I just felt like it.

179
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,719
No good news at all.

180
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
This is delicious.

181
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,159
How careless.
I'll take you to apply medicine.

182
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,199
It's fine, let's eat first.

183
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,599
Here.

184
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,840
There's so much scallion in this soup.

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,198
Yao hasn't cooked in a long time,
he really forgot I don't like scallions.

186
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:07,279
Someone else likes them.

187
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,999
Xueshan, what are you talking about?

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Nothing.

189
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,919
Uncle Yuze, Aunt Youmeng, you eat first.

190
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
I don't want to eat.

191
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,319
Xueshan seems angry.

192
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,880
Yao.

193
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
As her fiancé,

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
aren't you going to check on her?

195
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
Yuze.

196
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,600
Yao says this is delicious.

197
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
You love scallions.

198
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,999
Xueshan.

199
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,719
Stop messing around!

200
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,719
Messing around?

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,198
Jiang Yao, all these years,

202
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:03,358
you never forgot Lian Xinruo.

203
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,080
You think I didn't know?

204
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,158
I thought as long as I stayed
by your side,

205
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,039
one day,

206
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,360
I could replace her place in your heart.

207
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,919
But I never expected

208
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,840
even that frivolous woman Du Youmeng,

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,678
just because she has the same face
as Lian Xinruo,

210
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,559
she could occupy your heart.

211
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,238
Xueshan.

212
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,718
It's not what you think.

213
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,758
Wake up!

214
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,039
Lian Xinruo is already dead!

215
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
Shut up!

216
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,080
Sorry.

217
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,159
I shouldn't have lost
my temper with you.

218
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,799
Xueshan.

219
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,719
Just remember one thing.

220
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,678
We're about to get married.

221
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,039
This will not change.

222
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,040
Second Master,
I investigated this warehouse.

223
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,079
It was renovated five years ago,

224
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,358
and has mostly been empty.

225
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,358
Occasionally some goods
from Jiang City come in.

226
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,039
The most recent was yesterday.

227
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,719
Five years ago?

228
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,119
There was a small window at the back.

229
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,399
I pried it open a few days ago
when no one was guarding it.

230
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,040
We can enter from there.

231
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,759
The inside situation is still unclear.

232
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,119
We'll use a diversion.

233
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,079
I'll go with you.

234
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,440
No need, stay here, go.

235
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,439
Yuze.

236
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,640
Stop!

237
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,678
This is private property.

238
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,919
What are you doing?

239
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,720
Hello, sirs.

240
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:09,879
It's like this.

241
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,719
My car

242
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,959
broke down halfway,

243
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,080
and fell into a pit.

244
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,359
I wanted some help.

245
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,198
I wonder if you two

246
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,399
could help.

247
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,638
Don't worry,
I won't let you come for nothing.

248
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,519
Then I'll go with you and see.

249
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,399
What are you doing?

250
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,319
If anything happens to this batch,
don't think you can stay in Hu City.

251
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,158
Stop talking, get lost!

252
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,719
No, my car is right there.

253
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,198
It won't take long.

254
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:34,718
Please, two sirs, make it convenient.

255
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,679
More talk and I'll shoot you!

256
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,919
Out in the wilderness,

257
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,999
he suddenly appears.

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
Isn't that suspicious?

259
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,319
Stop!

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,720
