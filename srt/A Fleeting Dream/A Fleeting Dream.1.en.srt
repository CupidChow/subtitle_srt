=Episode 1=

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,530
(Lian Xinruo,
eldest daughter of the Lian family)

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,450
Why?

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,719
(Lian Zhong,
second branch of the Lian family)

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,450
Why?

15
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,289
My dear niece.

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,330
Go down and keep your father company.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,450
Father!

18
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,049
Father, save me!

19
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,529
No!

20
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,729
Bury her.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,319
(Lian Zhong)

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,769
(Lian Xinya, daughter of Lian Zhong)
Lian Xinya.

23
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,449
(If I make it out alive,)

24
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,489
(I'll make you pay in blood.)

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,650
(Five years later)

26
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,929
(It's been five years.)

27
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,889
(I've finally returned.)

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,959
(Pei Yuze)

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,440
(Second branch of the Pei family)
I heard Lian family only sent Lian Zhong.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,970
The business tycoon of Hu City
will fall tonight.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,210
That's amusing.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,290
Well?

33
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,889
Do I look good?

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,610
The tricks I taught you

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,370
aren't meant to be used on me.

36
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,689
What now?

37
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,449
Falling for me?

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,130
Don't worry.

39
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,889
Help me take my revenge,

40
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,849
and I'll make sure
you get your brother's life

41
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,089
and the position of
the Pei family's head.

42
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,249
Let's go.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,210
It's time for Hu City to liven up.

44
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,940
(Happiness)

45
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,798
(Jiang Yao,
godson to the Pei family's head)

46
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,169
Yao, why are you here?

47
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,159
(Pei Xueshan)

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,600
(Daughter of Pei Yujie)
Socializing is exhausting.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,329
I'm hiding here to laze around.

50
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,529
With Father away from Hu City,

51
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,809
so it's on you to manage
the Pei family affairs.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,969
You've worked hard.

53
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,689
I'm your fiancé.

54
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,959
We're family.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,530
These are my responsibilities.

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,210
Who knows what Du Youmeng is capable of,

57
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,289
but she's got Second Master Pei
rushing the engagement,

58
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,729
and the whole Pei family
hasn't even met her.

59
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,969
It's ridiculous.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,038
I heard that Second Master Pei can only
inherit some of the family's businesses

61
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,009
after getting married.

62
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,929
Everyone knows Pei Yuze
isn't going to live past thirty.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,839
I bet Du Youmeng's marrying him

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,798
just for the inheritance.

65
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,929
Please welcome the guest of honor.

66
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,489
Xin...

67
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:54,969
Xinruo!

68
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,679
(Happiness)

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,838
Welcome, everyone,
to my engagement banquet with Youmeng.

70
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,479
Today...

71
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,370
You...

72
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,249
I thought you were dead!

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,770
Mr. Lian, what do you mean?

74
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,358
Cursing my fiancée in public?

75
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,529
Lian Xinruo is still alive.

76
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,159
Wasn't she dating Jiang Yao before?

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,490
Why is she engaged to
Second Master Pei now?

78
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,920
- First love turns into Second Aunt.
- First love turns into Second Aunt.

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,409
This is going to be interesting.

80
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,318
Second Master, please forgive me.

81
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,239
It's just that

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,118
Miss Du looks so much like
my late niece.

83
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,249
I couldn't control myself.

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,530
My apologies.

85
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,850
Oh, I get it now.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,439
You've mistaken me for someone else.

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,879
Well, I grew up overseas.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,089
This is actually my first time
in Hu City.

89
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,290
But with how nervous this gentleman is,

90
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:52,569
could it be he did something
to wrong his niece?

91
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,329
Miss Du, you must be joking.

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,570
How could that be?

93
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,318
Dear guests,
before the ceremony kicks off,

94
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,199
we've got a concert for you.

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,850
Enjoy yourselves.

96
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,570
- All right.
- All right.

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,170
- Come on.
- This way, please.

98
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,710
(Shanghai, Xinxin Department Store)

99
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,210
Well.

100
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,609
Mr. Lian.

101
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,089
Miss Du.

102
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,809
To be honest with you.

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,318
You look very much like
my deceased niece.

104
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,729
It makes me wonder

105
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,569
if maybe you two
are actually the same person.

106
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,999
Why do you still think I'm your niece?

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,450
I mean no offense, Miss Du.

108
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,199
My late niece was truly unfortunate.

109
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,970
If she could really still be alive,

110
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,450
I could help my elder brother
take good care of her.

111
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:58,959
Oh, right.

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,410
My niece had a birthmark
on her lower back.

113
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,809
Miss Du, would you let me...

114
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,530
Help! Help!

115
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,169
You little rascal!

116
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,650
You really need a lesson!

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,050
You...

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,850
Lian Zhong, how dare you!

119
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,530
Don't get angry. Take care of yourself.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,970
I'm fine.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,810
Darling, are you okay?

122
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,889
My hand hurts so much!

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,010
For some reason, Boss Lian suddenly *
tried to take off my clothes.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,639
I guess being away so long has made
the people in Hu City forget

125
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,969
that I'm one of the Peis too.

126
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,210
Hence, you're acting so brazen.

127
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,959
Second Master, don't get me wrong.
It's not...

128
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,130
Forget it.

129
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,089
It's our engagement day today.

130
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,730
No need to argue
with someone irrelevant.

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,850
For Youmeng's sake,

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,930
I'll let it go today.

133
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,849
You're not welcome here.

134
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,969
Leave now.

135
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,969
Mr. Lian.

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,610
Do you know

137
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,729
what the smell of rain
mixed with soil is like?

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,530
(Rain and Soil.)

139
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,289
Whoever you are,

140
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,970
let's see how long
you can get away with this.

141
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,190
(Xinxin)

142
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,410
Yuze, give me a hand
with this zipper.

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,999
Jiang Yao, how dare you!

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,119
Who let you into my room?

145
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,370
Miss Du, what's your purpose
in getting close to Second Master Pei?

146
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,410
My purpose?

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,930
You barged into an elder's room
without permission.

148
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,490
And what's your purpose?

149
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,570
With that face, and so desperate
to marry into the Pei family,

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,158
is it for money or for revenge?

151
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,449
You really have some nerve.

152
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,198
What now? You and Lian Xinruo

153
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,238
got some dirty little secret?

154
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,689
Lian Xinruo's father killed my father.

155
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,010
But,

156
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,129
even if you're not Lian Xinruo,

157
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,770
with that face of yours,

158
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,129
I'm still very interested.

159
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,649
You...

160
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,879
What are you doing?

161
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,689
If Yuze saw us like this,

162
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,450
would he believe you, or me?

163
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,650
Yuze, he...

164
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,369
Yao.

165
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,690
Care to explain yourself?

166
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,410
Uncle Yuze, Miss Du,
don't get me wrong.

167
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,130
I am here to tell you both

168
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,370
that Master Pei knew nothing
about the engagement.

169
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,249
And now that it's fallen through,
with Master Pei returning soon,

170
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,010
if you two want to be together,

171
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,449
it won't be that easy.

172
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,930
Yao, remember who you are.

173
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,970
You're only Xueshan's fiancé.

174
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,170
That doesn't make you
part of the Pei family.

175
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,610
So when it comes to
the Pei elders' affairs,

176
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,690
you'd best not speak out of turn.

177
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,170
If that's the case,

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,850
I'll take my leave.

179
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,690
You've forgotten, haven't you?

180
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,689
Du Youmeng should hold
no hate toward Hu City.

181
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,929
Answer me again.

182
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:02,929
Du Youmeng should hold
no hate toward Hu City.

183
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,930
