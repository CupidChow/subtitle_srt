=Episode 15=

11
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,199
Mr. Jiang, since you reached out to me,

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,399
I guess you've come around

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,518
and decided to work with me.

14
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,509
I do have a task for you.

15
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,469
Once it's done,

16
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,159
apart from sending you away,

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,590
there are some other benefits for you.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,390
Considering how generous this offer is,

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,950
I'm afraid

20
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,629
it's nothing simple.

21
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,069
I want you

22
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,509
to get rid of Pei Yuze.

23
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,509
You'll stop pretending, huh?

24
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,709
You surrendered first last night.

25
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,469
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,798
I don't get it.

27
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,949
You don't get it?

28
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,629
If so...

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,230
Let's jot your memory.

30
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,239
Stop it!

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,270
I'll jot your memory.

32
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,349
Second Master,
you have a call from Mr. Wen.

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,639
Did you hear that?
Second Master, you have a call to answer.

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,870
"You have a call to answer."

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,118
Actually, Yuze and I can manage it.

36
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,920
You need not join us for the operation.

37
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,038
Wen Yuan isn't around,
so I don't feel at ease.

38
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,190
After sending you to the suburb
and meeting Wen Xuan, I'll leave.

39
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,440
Wen Xuan's investigation
has led to a cousin of mine,

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,149
who used to be a head candidate too.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,470
He studied medicine abroad.

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,469
He was at Pei Residence
not long before my poisoning.

43
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,709
I hope we can really find the lead
to the antidote.

44
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,118
Granny!

45
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,309
Are you alright?

46
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,518
I'm sorry

47
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,959
for having blocked your way.

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,270
Not at all.

49
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,879
Jin Se, send the old lady home first.

50
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,149
We'll wait for you here.

51
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,679
Sure.

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,630
Slowly.

53
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,070
Let's get some rest
while waiting for her here.

54
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,750
Yuze!

55
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:25,989
Where's the medicine?

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,630
How do you feel?

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,550
It's alright.
I'll be fine after some rest.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,430
Cold... I'm feeling so cold.

59
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,469
Cold?

60
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,949
I'll get you a jacket.

61
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,149
Xinruo!

Pei Yuze! Pei Yuze!

65
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,358
Sir, have you seen this young man

66
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,318
sitting at the tea stall?

67
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,229
No.

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,999
Jiang Yao! Jiang Yao, this is bad!

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,099
- Xinruo, what's it with you?
- This is bad. I went to buy Yuze a jacket.

70
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,919
- When I came down and turned around,
- Calm down.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,159
- Yuze was gone. I...
- Calm down.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,439
Calm down. I'll have my men
search for him in the city.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,439
Stay at home. I'll let you know
at once if there's any news.

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,590
No, that's not enough. The suburb...

75
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,358
That's right.
I'll look for him in the suburb.

76
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,869
Xinruo. Xinruo!

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,759
You heard that, butler.

78
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,518
Go look for him!

79
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,919
Sure...

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,790
- Second Master!
- Second Master!

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,750
Have you seen this man?

82
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,558
Have you seen this man?

83
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,629
No.

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,079
Miss, excuse me.
May I know if you've seen this man?

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,919
He's about this tall.

86
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,190
- No.
- I haven't seen him.

87
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,479
Excuse me, miss.

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,679
Have you seen this man?

89
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,399
No.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,359
Please try to recall it.

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,709
No, I truly haven't seen him.

92
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,189
Sir, may I know
if you've seen this man?

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,030
No.

94

95
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,078
The night is falling.

96
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,838
Head home now.

97
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,029
I'll keep looking for him.

98
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,639
You may head back if you want to.

99
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,750
I'll look for him.

100
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,469

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,520
Miss Xinruo has had a cold.

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,240
Also, she's physically
and mentally exhausted.

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,640
I'll get her a prescription.
She'll be fine after a few days of rest.

106
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,029
Thank you, Dr. Fang.

107
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,309
Xinruo, be patient

108
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,679
and rest well.

109
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,750
Just leave the rest to me.

110
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,309
Master Jiang!

111
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:29,358
Master Jiang. Master Jiang, this is bad!

112
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,758
Miss Lian insists on going out

113
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,469
and we can't stop her!

114
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,000
Xinruo, you're still sick.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,598
Go back to your room
and get some rest.

116
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,598
Please leave me alone.

117
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,469
Xinruo, where are you going
at this late hour?

118
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,719
I beg of you, please leave me alone.

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,559
I'll feel on edge

120
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,199
until Yuze is found.

121
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,078
Xinruo.

122
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,669
Pei Yuze might be...

123
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,149
Xinruo.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,278
Where have you been?

125
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,919
I thought I...

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,558
Don't worry. See, I'm all fine.

127
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,518
It was all my fault.

128
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,798
I was to blame for it.

129
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,078
When I turned around,

130
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,558
I found out that you were gone.

131
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,278
And I couldn't find you anywhere.

132
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,430
Don't blame yourself for that.
Then I'll always stay by your side, okay?

133
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,029
Yuze, I...

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,870
Xinruo.

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,950
Xinruo!

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,830
Xinruo!

137
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,149
Go away.

138
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,189
Yuze...

139
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,829
What exactly happened?

140
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,629
After you left,

141
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,749
I was kidnapped
by the two tea stall servers.

142
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,318
They tried to take me out of the city

143
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:51,549
and get rid of me.

144
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,070
I got out of the car
when they let their guard down.

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,790
Luckily, Wen Yuan found me.

146
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,718
I'm sorry. I...

147
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,109
What are you blaming yourself for?

148
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,109
Get some rest first.

149
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,549
Have a good sleep.

150
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,669
Jin Se has gone missing.

151
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,919
Looks like that old lady
we met this afternoon

152
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,670
was in cahoots
with those tea stall servers.

153
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,638
Come with me.

154
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,590
- But Second Master, you're still...
- I'm alright.

155
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,389
Father...

156
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,630
Father...

157
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,630
Jiao Jiao.

158
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,789
Jiao Jiao.

159
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,269
Jiao Jiao.

160
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:18,349
Father?

161
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,709
I've finally seen you again.

162
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,120
You're already an 18-year-old lady.
Still acting like a little girl, huh?

163
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,910
Oh, right.

164
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,590
Today's your birthday.

165
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,790
Quick, get yourself ready.

166
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,229
But aren't you...

167
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,629
What's it?

168
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,509
I think I had a nightmare.

169
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,229
I dreamed about your passing.

170
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,950
Silly girl.

171
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,158
Go ahead now.

172
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,549
Yao is waiting for you.

173
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,030
Go on.

174
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,550
What a lovely strawberry cake!

175
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,238
Where's Mr. Jiang?

176
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,399
My father is busy.

177
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,829
Let's not wait for him.
Xinruo, blow out the candles now.

178
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,310
Sooner or later,

179
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,510
you'll have to start calling Mr. Jiang Father.

180
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,399
You're unbelievable, Father!

181
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,830
Blow out the candles already.

182
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,590
You only get to unwrap your gift
after making a wish.

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,790
You don't deserve Second Master!
Get lost already!

184
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,390
What a shameless liar!

185
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,230
No...

186
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,509
No!

187
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,870
No!

188
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,269
- You're that murderer's daughter!
- You're that murderer's daughter!

189
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,590
Xinruo.

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,030
Xinruo.

191
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,869
Yuze.

192
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,549
Great! You're finally here!

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,390
Without the antidote,

194
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,669
I can't hold on much longer.

195
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,109
I'm leaving.

196
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,670
Where are you going?

197
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,510
Yuze!

198
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,630
Xinruo.

199
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,550
I can't get rid of the poison in me.

200
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,229
I'm leaving.

201
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,110
Where are you going?

202
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,350
My days are numbered.

203
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,190
Xinruo.

204
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,629
Will you still be with me?

205
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,829
I will.

206
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,389
No matter what your fate is,

207
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,150
I'll be with you.

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,550
Come with me, okay?

209
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,429
Don't leave me alone.

210
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,589
Come on.

211
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,510
Here.

212
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,030
Come.

213
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,270
Yuze.

214
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,509
I'll stay by your side.
