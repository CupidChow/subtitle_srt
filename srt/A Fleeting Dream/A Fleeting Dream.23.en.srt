11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,278
Xinruo.

12
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,679
The Pei family are all liars!

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,719
He'll only hurt you.

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,838
Come with me, I'll take you away.

15
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:16,278
Let's leave Hu City, alright?

16
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,569
Get a hold of yourself.

17
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:23,009
Pei Yuze, I'll kill you!

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,250
Watch out!

19
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,449
What a fine show.

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,210
Pei Xueshan, I'll kill you!

21
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,689
Why did you lie to me, Pei Xueshan?

22
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,609
Because you're a fool.

23
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,529
If you never loved me,

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,330
why did you get engaged to me?

25
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,399
Yao, you chose me.

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,210
I never chose you.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,558
How dare you
disrespect the family head!

28
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,479
Guards!

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,038
Drag her to the ancestral hall.

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,329
Punish her by family law.

31
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,639
He's lost his mind. Take him out!

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,530
Yes!

33
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,000
Move!

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,558
- Useless fool, what a waste.
- Keep still!

35
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,289
Let go of me! Where's Xinruo?

36
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,609
I'm marrying Xinruo!

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,450
I'm about to become family head!

38
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:27,009
Now, it's your turn.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,250
Pei Xueshan.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,010
I know what you want.

41
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,009
I'll pass the position to you.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,319
But you must let Xinruo go.

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,209
Yuze!

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,810
I've already made my will.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,798
If I go missing for more than three days,
all of the Pei family's assets

46
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,929
will automatically
be managed by an overseas trust.

47
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,649
Unless I personally write

48
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,889
and sign a letter before that happens,

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,130
passing the title
of family head to you.

50
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,049
If you're willing to write it now,

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,890
then I might consider it.

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,959
We can't trust her.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,839
If you write it down,

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,729
she'll kill us on the spot.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,798
Do you think sparing you now

56
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,649
means you'll live a few more days?

57
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:14,809
It doesn't matter.

58
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,929
If she doesn't want
the key to the family head's position,

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,838
she can always test me.

60
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,969
The key?

61
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,089
That's right.

62
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,598
Only the heads of the Pei family

63
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,558
know of this key's existence.

64
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,639
It holds the Pei family's
most treasured collection

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,690
from the past hundred years.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,330
Pei Yujie surely never told Jiang Yao,

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,970
let alone you.

68
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,689
As long as you promise
to give us the antidote afterward,

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,770
I'll hand you the key.

70
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,049
Deal.

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,779
(Pei Residence)

72
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,529
You, come here.

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,690
Miss.

74
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,889
Wrong.

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,650
From now on, I am the family head!

76
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,009
Yes, Madam.

77
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,990
(Two days later)

78
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,439
Yuze, how bad is your injury?

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,679
Are you feeling better?

80
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,930
It's nothing, just a flesh wound.

81
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,598
What you told Xueshan

82
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,639
about the overseas trust company

83
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,530
and the family head's key
were all lies, weren't they?

84
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,479
That way,

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,890
she'd have no reason
to kill us right away.

86
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,849
I knew I couldn't fool you.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,850
Besides, I came prepared.

88
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,278
I have a blade in the necklace.

89
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,929
We can use it to break free.

90
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,358
It's an honor
to have you here, Commander.

91
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,969
I am truly grateful.

92
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,919
Miss Pei, don't take offense.

93
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,210
He's never comfortable
at these gatherings.

94
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,598
I understand.
The Pei family are merely merchants.

95
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,439
For the Commander
to grace us with his presence

96
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,399
is already our greatest honor.

97
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,810
This way, please.

98
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,249
Please, sit.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,570
Do you know
where Miss Lian and Second Master are?

100
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,639
Second Uncle took Miss Lian overseas.

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,838
They left in a hurry

102
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,838
and had no time to say goodbye.

103
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,649
I apologize to you on their behalf.

104
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,329
Please excuse me.

105
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,000
(Tablets of Beloved Wife Lian Xinruo
and Late Husband Jiang Yao)

106
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,890
Wen Yuan.

107
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,118
How's your injury?

108
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,118
Why are you here?

109
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,889
This isn't the time for that.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,450
Second Master, something big is
about to happen to the Pei family.

111
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,999
I welcome you all, honored guests,

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,959
to my banquet of gratitude.

113
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,879
All of you here today

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,410
are the leading figures in Hu City's
political and business circles.

115
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,679
The Pei family has been able
to take root and prosper in Hu City

116
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
thanks to your trust and support.

117
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,439
So tonight's banquet

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,890
is not only to celebrate
my succession as family head.

119
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,290
I've also prepared a gift

120
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,690
for each of you.

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,090
Pei Xueshan, what are you doing?

122
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,530
Everyone, don't panic.

123
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,210
I have good news to share with you all.

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,449
General Matsumoto has
a deep interest in Hu City's culture.

125
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,610
He'd like to befriend everyone here.

126
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,959
If you are willing,

127
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,759
once General Matsumoto
arrives in Hu City,

128
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,649
he will treat you all kindly.

129
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,718
Your lives in Hu City will
remain unchanged.

130
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,158
Pei Xueshan, so you really
did collude with the Japanese!

131
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,169
You betrayed your country
for personal gain!

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,798
Your actions are vile
and against the Pei family rules.

133
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:33,329
You deserve to be
cast out of the family.

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,929
You talk too much.

135
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,439
Commander, if you
agrees to open the gates

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,479
and welcome General Matsumoto in,

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,919
then I promise

138
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,650
you will still govern
the city in the General's place.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,770
And if I refuse?

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,130
Then, that's a pity.

141
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,570
Because you won't be
leaving the Pei residence alive.

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,399
Quickly, put down your guns!

143
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,079
Put them down, don't move!

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,370
Stay where you are!

145
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,970
Madam.

146
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,009
Miss Lian.

147
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,170
How did you get in here?

148
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,170
Pei Xueshan, your people outside
are already subdued.

149
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,889
Surrender now.

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,690
Commander Zhang.

151
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,009
This was all Pei Xueshan's doing.

152
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,160
It has nothing to do with the rest
of Pei family.

153
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,718
I hope you'll show mercy

154
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,489
and not hold the family accountable.

155
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,050
If that's the case,

156
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,010
I won't pursue the Pei family further.

157
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,049
But these Japanese

158
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,809
must not stay.

159
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,929
Wait!

160
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,718
Commander Zhang, I believe
this is all just a misunderstanding.

161
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:14,009
General Matsumoto never
intended to be your enemy.

162
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,609
This was all Pei Xueshan
acting on her own.

163
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,969
It has nothing to do with us.

164
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,158
If you want to punish her,

165
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,718
we will not stand in your way.

166
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,599
No!

167
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,158
How can you betray me now?

168
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,999
You promised...

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,170
Silence!

170
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,610
You are shameless.

171
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,289
How dare you ruin
the friendship between our nations!

172
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,638
Commander Zhang,
I've heard the Chinese saying,

173
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,678
"The fewer troubles, the better."

174
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,049
To show my sincerity,

175
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,250
I will take my men
and leave Hu City tonight.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,650
But if they suffer heavy losses,

177
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,969
I believe

178
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:53,449
you wouldn't want this to spark
a war with General Matsumoto.

179
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,650
In that case,

180
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,209
please go.

181
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,929
It's over now.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,970
What happened today must be kept quiet.

183
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,770
Pei Xueshan colluded with the Japanese

184
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,689
and even killed someone in public.

185
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,049
For now,
confine her to the Pei residence.

186
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,489
I'll leave guards here to watch her.

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,290
Once the storm has passed,

188
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,370
she will be tried

189
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,290
as an example to all.

190
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,170
Understood, Commander.

191
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,559
Take her away.

192
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,530
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,089
Move.

194
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,410
Let go!

195
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,009
Let go of me! Release me!

196
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,810
It's my fault for being too late.

197
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,889
Otherwise, Third Granduncle
wouldn't have died.

198
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,769
Yuze.

199
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,650
This isn't your fault.

200
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,249
I believe Granduncle's spirit in heaven

201
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,089
wouldn't blame you either.

202
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,250
Now the Commander has
put the city under martial law.

203
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,370
Hopefully Hu City will
soon be at peace again.

204
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,970
Second Master!

205
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,760
Pei Xueshan knocked out the guards.

206
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,500
The servants tried to stop her,
but she's hiding in the ancestral hall.

207
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,950
(Pei Family Ancestral Hall)

208
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,090
Family Head, Miss Lian.

209
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,439
What's happening inside?

210
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,079
Miss Xueshan has filled
the hall with oil and fire.

211
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,090
We don't dare get close.

212
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:47,009
Pei Yuze, Lian Xinruo!

213
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,410
The antidote formula is in my hands.

214
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,170
If you want to live,
come in and face me.

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,250
It's alright.

216
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,569
If we go, we go together.

217
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,209
Which of you can measure up to me?

218
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,770
Just because I'm a woman,
you all looked down on me.

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
You'd rather favor
the lowborn son of a secretary

220
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,569
than give me a glance.

221
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,758
The Pei family

222
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,849
is a bunch of disgusting hypocrites!

223
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,150
(Tablet of Beloved Father, Pei Yujie)

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,610
Pei Yujie, you must think
you're so brilliant.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,330
Yet, you'll die by my hands!

226
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,809
You men...

227
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,409
Every last one of you is a fool.

228
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
I bested all of you!

229
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,760
(Tablet of Pei Yujie)

230
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,930
Pei Yuze.

231
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,649
And you.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,450
Do you know why I poisoned you?

233
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,569
Because from
the very first moment I saw you,

234
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,609
I knew you would be
my greatest obstacle.

235
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,249
If I don't get rid of you,

236
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,410
I can never become family head.

237
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,610
You want
the antidote formula, don't you?

238
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,169
Why don't we play a little game?

239
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,758
On this table are two cups of wine.

240
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,039
One of them is laced with deadly poison.

241
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,170
Drink it, and you'll die instantly.

242
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:55,399
Each of you will pick a cup

243
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,170
and drink it.

244
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,930
Whoever survives gets the antidote.

245
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,690
The other can serve as my burial gift.

246
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,330
We won't play your childish game.

247
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,690
Wait.

248
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,330
Drink!

249
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,650
Drink it!

250
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,409
Now!

251
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,209
No!

252
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,730
Drink it!

253
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,929
Yuze!

254
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,289
These two cups...

255
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,330
They both have poison.

256
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,090
As expected, I couldn't fool you.

257
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,249
But even so,

258
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,570
don't think either of you
will leave here alive.

259
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,129
Xinruo!

260
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,170
Xinruo!

261
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,449
Xinruo!

262
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,049
It's the incense.

263
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,810
The formula!

264
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,050
Pei Yuze, aren't you supposed
to be smarter than this?

265
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,650
Then, let's play another game.

266
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,889
Guess. How will you die today?

267
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,770
Yuze!

268
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,970
Lian Xinruo, I'll kill you!

269
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,210
Xinruo!
