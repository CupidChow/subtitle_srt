Father!

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,940
Father!

13
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,539
Father, please help me!

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,180
Why?

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,580
Uncle Zhong.

16
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,699
Xinya.

17
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,518
(Wu Peirong, Chief of Police)

18
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,299
Why?

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,459
My dear niece.

20
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,499
Go down and keep your father company.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,220
I'll burn more offerings for you both.

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,420
Father!

23
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,379
No!

24
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,579
Bury her.

25
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,639
Youmeng, Youmeng, wake up!

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,518
Don't come near me!

27
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:01,838
Let go of me!

28
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,078
- Stay away from me!
- Youmeng, it's me!

29
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,258
Let me go! Don't come near me!

30
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,038
- It's alright, don't be afraid.
- Let go of me!

31
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,619
- Don't be scared, Jiao Jiao.
- Don't come closer!

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,460
Don't be afraid, Jiao Jiao, it's over.

33
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,620
I'm here, you're safe now.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,780
I'm here, Jiao Jiao, it's alright.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,860
It's okay now.

36
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,779
Uncle Yuze.

37
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,959
Uncle Yuze, Miss Du.

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,140
Are you both alright?

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,900
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,399
Sorry, Uncle Yuze, Miss Du.

41
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,278
We heard screams from the room and
we thought something happened, so we...

42
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,619
Get out now.

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,180
Sure, we're leaving!

44
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,259
Not getting down yet?

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,340
We'll be married soon,

46
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,179
it's normal to be a bit close.

47
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,859
I was wrong.

48
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,459
Here.

49
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,060
Yuze.

50
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,139
Hey, look at Second Master's neck.

51
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,879
Those just back from overseas
really go all out,

52
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,019
partying hard.

53
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,798
No sense of shame.

54
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,219
Look at Miss Xueshan.

55
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,118
That's what a real lady should be like.

56
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,939
Exactly. Let's go.

57
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,518
You're a long way off,

58
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,059
no need to put on an act.

59
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,379
A performance's gotta be the full set.

60
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,659
But your dissociative fits...

61
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,939
You need to find a way to control them.

62
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,499
Ever since five years ago,

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,700
when Uncle Zhong's family tried to
seize the Lian family fortune,

64
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,259
they buried me alive,

65
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,459
and told everyone
I drowned myself at sea.

66
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,339
If you hadn't saved me,

67
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,979
I would've been long dead.

68
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,358
But since then, I developed
these dissociative spells.

69
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,899
Every thunderstorm
triggers them uncontrollably.

70
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,100
Only when I avenge myself and my father,

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,340
will this illness finally heal.

72
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,619
A wounded heart needs the right remedy.

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,020
Now Lian Zhong is paralyzed and mute,

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,460
and Lian Xinya
hasn't made it back in time.

75
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,758
This is the perfect chance to
reclaim the Lian family seal.

76
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,699
Exactly.

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,919
Once we get that seal,

78
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,180
I can take back
control of the Lian family,

79
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,819
and uncover the truth of
my father's disappearance.

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,100
But we can't be careless.

81
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,939
Our foothold in Hu City is still weak.

82
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,420
Someone else may be pulling strings
behind the Lian family.

83
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,318
Miss Du, you still have some luggage
in the storeroom.

84
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,979
The butler asked you to take a look.

85
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,579
Alright.

86
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:52,278
Yuze, I'll go pack up my things first.

87
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,459
See you later.

88
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,340
(The situation is uncertain.)

89
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,379
(I can't let her know about my illness yet.)

90
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,259
My lady, this is the place.

91
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,080
(The Pei family ancestral hall)

92
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,440
(Ancestral virtue lives on)

93
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,960
(Tablets of Ancestors: Pei Jiansheng,
Pei Rangshao)

94
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,719
A man is stopped by paper,

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,199
a spirit by a mountain apart.

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,758
With dog's blood splashed,

97
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,819
all evil spirits are expelled.

98
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,179
I am the Pei family's steward.

99
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,118
By seniority,

100
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:05,019
even the Master must call me Aunt.

101
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,679
Miss Du, you've acted shamelessly

102
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,980
and recklessly.

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,078
You've violated the Pei family rules.

104
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,838
Here before our ancestors,

105
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,059
I will punish you under family law!

106
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,659
Sorry, I couldn't hold it in.

107
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,519
The Qing Dynasty is long gone.

108
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,119
Did no one bother
telling the Pei family?

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,740
How dare you, Du Youmeng!

110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,039
You vile courtesan!

111
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,519
Seducing Second Master
with your dirty tricks,

112
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,580
scheming to marry into the Pei family.

113
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,999
Today, I'll make you understand

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,439
you can't just waltz into a family
like ours!

115
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,740
Get her now!

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,859
You... How dare you to...

117
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,678
Since you talk to me
about rules and morals,

118
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,638
let me tell you this, a servant

119
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,299
shouting at their master,

120
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,798
that's pure insolence!

121
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,519
Get up and hit her!

122
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,718
Hit her hard!

123
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,838
Beat her to death!

124
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,419
Who dares to make trouble here?

125
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,399
Master Pei!

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,158
Look at what this wicked woman

127
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,358
has done to our ancestral hall!

128
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,940
Master!

129
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,559
Seize her now!

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,660
Who even dares?

131
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,600
Master Pei, my wedding with Yuze
may be ruined,

132
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,079
but I'm still staying here.

133
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,798
(Pei Yujie, head of the Pei Family)
I'm still a guest of your family.

134
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,838
Is this really how you
treat your guests?

135
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,318
Miss Du, whoever damages

136
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,699
the Pei family ancestral hall

137
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,659
will have to answer to the Pei family!

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,959
What are you waiting for?

139
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,798
Seize her, 20 strikes with the rod.

140
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,659
Yes!

141
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,678
Master, doing this behind
the Second Master's back,

142
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,619
he won't let it slide!

143
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,318
Yuze is inexperienced

144
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:54,919
and has been bewitched
by this courtesan,

145
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,479
tarnishing the Pei family's reputation.

146
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,980
As his elder brother, it's my duty
to discipline her for him.

147
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,638
Beat her!

148
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,939
Yes, move!

149
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,340
Beat her!

150
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,119
(Ledger)

151
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,260
Stop it!

152
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,299
Brother.

153
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,219
It's been years since we last met.

154
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,559
You've become even harsher.

155
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,620
Yuze, I'm doing this for your own good.

156
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,158
You're a direct descendant
of the Pei family.

157
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,439
Your future wife

158
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,100
should be well-matched
in family and status.

159
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,740
Why don't you take a look
at the gift I've prepared for you?

160
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,660
(Ledger)

161
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,219
Where did you get this?

162
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,660
It's an engagement gift,
though I don't know from whom.

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm handing it to you

164
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,620
because I have no interest
in the Pei family's business.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,220
And I hope you won't make things hard
for Youmeng from now on.

166
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,479
Second Master, this is outrageous!

167
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,678
For this wretched woman,

168
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,079
how dare you even threaten the Master!

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,718
Brother, using such foul language,

170
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,459
by the family rules,
what should be done?

171
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,540
Caning.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,140
Ten strikes.

173
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,718
Master!

174
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,318
Do it!

175
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:13,838
Yes.

176
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,019
Master! Master!

177
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,499
Thank you, brother,
for handling this fairly.

178
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,779
Master!

179
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,139
Master!

180
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,419
It'll hurt a bit.

181
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,198
Compared to the injuries from training,
this is nothing.

182
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,379
I'll apply medicine first.

183
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,019
I want to take a bath.

184
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,779
Don't make trouble.

185
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,900
No.

186
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,638
The hall
reeks of black dog's blood today.

187
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,059
It stank terribly.

188
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,980
I want to take a bath.

189
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,980
I want to...

190
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,980
I want to take a bath.

191
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,499
I need a bath.

192
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,379
I'll have someone prepare hot water.

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,420
After bathing,
apply medicine immediately.

194
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,899
Miss Du, I brought medicine for you.

195
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,580
Miss Du.

196
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,980
Xueshan.

197
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,060
Why are you here?

198
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,979
I bring Miss Du some medicine
for her injuries.

199
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,460
That's thoughtful of you.

200
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,599
(Blessed by Heaven and Earth)

201
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,140
Jiang Yao, my father was framed.

202
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,820
There's no way he would,
or could killed Uncle Jiang.

203
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,638
Why won't you believe me?

204
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,959
And why won't you help me?

205
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,980
That's enough!

206
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,439
How could you expect me to trust
the daughter of my father's killer?

207
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,740
You're being unreasonable.

208
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,100
All you want is for me
to change my mind.

209
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,399
I'm about to get engaged to Xueshan.

210
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,718
Please leave now

211
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,939
or I won't spare you out of old ties!

212
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,020
Jiang Yao!

213
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:20,179
Thank you for attending
my engagement banquet with Xueshan.

214
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,539
May you soon be blessed with a child.

215
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,660
Something's wrong! Move aside!

216
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,619
Xinruo has thrown herself into the sea!

217
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,659
Who exactly are you?

218
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,339
Yao!

219
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,340
Xueshan, what's wrong?

220
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,419
Du Youmeng... Du Youmeng is Lian Xinruo!
