Jiang Yao! Jiang Yao!

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,680
Even after he lost his mind,
Jiang Yao still couldn't forget you.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,320
Lian Xinruo,
you truly have a hold on him.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,920
But it's a pity.

23
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,239
You and Pei Yuze will never be together.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
Surrender now.

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,360

31
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,319
I just didn't expect

32
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,919
that in the end,
Jiang Yao would be the one to save us.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,639
Yuze,

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
the formula was burned.

35
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,159
Don't lose hope.

36
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,078
Today, Wen Yuan found a small vial

37
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,719
in Pei Xueshan's room.

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
We still have a chance.

The traveling doctor says several ingredients
match the ones in his pills.

42
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:14,039
This must be the antidote.

43
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,879
I knew it!

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,399
On my way out this morning,
I heard magpies chirping.

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,919
I just knew good news was coming!

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,318
See? Here it is.

47
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,558
To be honest,

48
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,719
I was worried sick earlier.

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,919
My heart was racing.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,919
Don't worry. Things are looking up now.

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,798
Xinruo.

52
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,759
Come.

53
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,159
Think you can handle this?

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,919
Why not?

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,239
It looks fine to me.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
Isn't this how it's roasted?

57
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
Trust me.

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Are you sure?

59
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,799
It's catching fire!

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,480
All done!

61
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:08,999
Taste it.

62
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
Just trust me this once.

63
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,560
It doesn't look great,
but it tastes good.

64
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,839
You tricked me again!

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560

66
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,200
Six bamboos.

67
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,118
Alright.

68
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,679
A little longer won't hurt.

69
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,639
Can you really do this?

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,920
Don't move. You have to trust me.

71
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,999
Something feels off.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,038
No, it's not finished yet.

73
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,439
Just wait a little longer.

74
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,160
See?

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,640
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

76
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,839
Fine then.

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,919
I'll draw one for you too.

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
No thanks, I'm good.

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Don't cheat. Come back here!

82
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,840
Tired?

83
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,080
Not at all.

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
Look at Pigsy carrying his bride.

85
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,879
You're the Pigsy.

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,960
Yuze.

87
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,199
The power's out.

88
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,439
Yuze?

89
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,640
Yuze? Yuze!

90
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:53,879
A red thread ties our fates together.

91
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,599
A perfect match.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,080
May we grow old together with love
as fragrant as cassia and orchids.

93
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,759
A bond sealed for life, a union blessed.

94
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,119
Like blossoms in spring,
may our home be filled with harmony.

95
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,799
With this vow of lifelong devotion,
I write it upon this red paper.

96
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,039
Great.

97
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
Let our vow of marriage...

98
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,080
be written in the registry.

99

100
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,039
Will you marry me?

101
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,960
I will.

102
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:08,679
I want to wait
until our wedding to put it on.

103
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Alright.

104
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,199
On our wedding day,

105
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
I will put it on you.

106
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,319
Well,

107
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,959
I planned this surprise for so long.

108
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Shouldn't there be a little reward?

109
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,799
Not enough.

The next couple is about to come in.

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,238
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,559
He was held up by something last minute.

121

Please give us a little more time.

122
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,239
Honestly, how can he be late
for something this important?

123
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,239
You finally made it.

Why is this happening?

Xinruo.

130
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm sorry.

131
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,879
We took the antidote.

132
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,279
We took it.

133
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,999
How is this happening?

134
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,920
Why hasn't the poison cleared?

135

Xinruo, come here.

136
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,560
There was only one antidote pill, right?

137
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,280
Why did you lie to me?

138
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,439
What about the suppressant?

139
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Where is the medicine now?

140
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,718
We should take it right now,

141
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,879
then think of another way.

142
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,359
It won't help.

143
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,040
Why did you lie to me?

144

You promised
you would stay with me forever.

Don't be sad.

(You are one
of the few blessings I have known.)

189
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,559
(Though I hate to leave you like this,)

190
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,799
(I believe)

191
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,160
(even if I am not by your side,)

192
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,600
(you can stand on your own.)

193
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,800
(I only hope
we meet sometimes in dreams)

194
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,080
(so I will know you are safe.)

195
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,280
(There are no words
to express my longing.)

196
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,919
(I wish you a life of joy, my love.)

197
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,720
(Pei Yuze, final letter.)

198
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,840
(The Nineties)

199
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,080
(Old Lian Xinruo)
