Are your hands okay?

12
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,038
I'm fine.

13
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,859
You have to...

14
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,859
Youmeng.

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,400
(Pei Residence)

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,940
So cool.

17
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,819
So comfortable.

18
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,040
(Jin Se, Lian Xinruo's assistant)

19
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,980
Awake?

20
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,779
Yes, I'll go wash my face.

21
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,459
What are you doing?

22
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,259
Nothing.

23
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,758
What's going on?

24
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,999
Did the wound split open?

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,980
No.

26
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,860
It was me. I just tried to shave

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,140
and accidentally hurt my hand.

28
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,838
Since you took care of me
so well last night,

29
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,779
I'll help you. Let's go.

30
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,339
Let's go.

31
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,619
I'll do it myself.

32
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,518
Don't move.

33
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,598
If such a beautiful face got scratched,

34
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,059
I would be irresponsible.

35
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,260
Second Master.

36
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,899
Second Master, I'm back.

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,979
(Wen Yuan, Pei Yuze's assistant)
I've already caught the person

38
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:27,679
who attacked Miss Du.

39
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,420
It was ordered by Lian Xinya, I'm done.

40
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,240
Also, Lian family will elect
a new family head tomorrow.

41
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,220
I'm really done now.

42
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,779
I didn't expect things
to develop so fast.

43
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,719
Luckily, Jin Se got the seal in advance.

44
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,758
Tomorrow,

45
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,659
I can return to the Lian family
as Lian Xinruo,

46
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,780
and become the new family head
of the Lian family.

47
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,340
For Lian Xinya to call
the stewards so quickly,

48
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,820
there must be backing.

49
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,460
Don't act rashly.

50
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,860
The Lian family stewards
are all my father's elders.

51
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,099
If they know I'm alive,

52
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,980
they will surely support me.

53
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,300
Uncles and elders,

54
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,199
my Father is bedridden now.

55
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,399
The Lian family cannot be
without a head even for a day.

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,239
That's why I invited you all today

57
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,860
to discuss the head of the Lian family.

58
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,798
Ever since Mr. Lian had an accident,

59
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:34,199
Xinya has handled everything thoroughly.

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,060
Everyone has seen it.

61
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,118
So the candidate for
the head of Lian family

62
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,779
must be Xinya.

63
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,558
Thank you, Uncle Pei.

64
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:45,379
(If you ask me,
who holds the Lian family seal)

65
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,419
(should be the head of the Lian family.)

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,439
(Isn't it relying on Pei Yujie
behind the scenes?)

67
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,660
(I think the Lian family
will soon change to Pei.)

68
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,900
(I wish the family head were here.)

69
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,999
Since everyone has no objection,

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
then the candidate
for Lian family head is...

71
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,940
Wait.

72
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,380
This is... Isn't this...

73
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,939
Sorry, I'm late.

74
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,598
Isn't this Miss Xinruo?

75
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,019
You're not dead, great!

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,420
Du Youmeng,

77
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,300
why are you here?

78
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,439
Today the Lian family is choosing
a new head,

79
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,879
of course I have to come back.

80
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,518
You're not even a Lian family member,

81
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,399
what right do you have
to choose the family head?

82
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,500
Xinya.

83
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,859
You don't know whether
I'm a Lian family member?

84
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,318
I am Lian Xinruo.

85
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:41,959
You...

86
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,620
I brought back the Lian family seal.

87
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,838
How is this possible?

88
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,979
Impossible.

89
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,199
Really?

90
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,180
Yes, it really is the Lian family seal.

91
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,580
Impossible.

92
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,199
The Lian family seal disappeared
five years ago.

93
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,700
This must be fake.

94
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,919
Great, Xinruo.

95
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,340
You're finally back.

96
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,758
This seal is real,

97
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,299
but the person may not be.

98
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,679
Stewards.

99
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,959
Today's situation is sudden.

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,180
The election of family head
is very important,

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,660
but Miss Du cannot prove her identity,

102
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,220
then we will discuss it another day.

103
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,699
Discuss another day.

104
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,699
Steward.

105
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,019
Du Youmeng.

106
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,520
(Pei Residence)

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,980
Maybe you're right.

108
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:49,099
I thought reclaiming
the Lian family would be too simple.

109
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,599
Don't rush.

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,140
After all, Pei Yujie has operated
in Hu City for so many years.

111
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,700
The Lian family has long been
infiltrated by his influence.

112
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,819
The Lian father and daughter

113
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,419
are nothing but his puppets.

114
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,499
I know.

115
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,758
But now all the Lian family stewards

116
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,659
dare not oppose Pei Yujie openly.

117
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,399
I'm worried that if this continues,

118
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,859
the foundation of the Lian family
will be completely exhausted.

119
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,100
Compared to the position of family head,

120
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,260
there's an even more serious matter now.

121
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,220
I suspect your Father's death
is related to Pei Yujie.

122
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,540
What?

123
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,499
Back then,
everything was done flawlessly.

124
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,420
The person behind it was not simple.

125
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,939
Looking at the current state
of the Lian family,

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,780
this possibility is very high.

127
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,059
So you must be careful.

128
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,179
Yao, what do you think?

129
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,499
Godfather,
Du Youmeng's words cannot be trusted.

130
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,999
You grew up with Lian Xinruo,

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,500
you know best what is true and false.

132
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,019
Have someone keep an eye
on Du Youmeng and Pei Yuze.

133
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,739
Report to me immediately
if anything unusual happens.

134
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,820
Understood.

135
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,959
Go confirm again

136
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,380
whether Lian Xinruo really died.

137
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:34,158
Since you brought up
the old matters of the Lian family,

138
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,459
then whether you are Lian Xinruo or not,

139
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,339
you cannot stay.

140
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,260
Hurry up, you all.

141
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,699
Miss, we've dug it up.

142
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,180
You brat.

143
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,219
How dare you lie to me.

144
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,959
Fine, dig out the body.

145
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,980
Yes.

146
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,798
Du Youmeng, what are you doing?
Let me go!

147
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,399
Didn't you follow me all the way

148
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,399
to kill me?

149
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,399
Why ask me instead?

150
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,519
Stop pretending.

151
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,399
You are not Lian Xinruo at all.

152
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,399
Really? I remember
at the Lian Residence,

153
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,999
the first time you saw me,

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,519
you called me Xinruo.

155
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,119
You're not Lian Xinruo,

156
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,479
who exactly are you?

157
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,660
Let me tell you.

158
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,860
Even if the Lian family is given to you,

159
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,500
you won't be able to hold it.

160
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,540
I'll kill you!

161
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,619
Good luck.

162
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,259
(Such skills, definitely not Xinruo.)

163
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,700
Yao.

164
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,060
Why are you here, Miss Du?

165
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:48,399
Weren't you following me all along?

166
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,060
You are really sharp.

167
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:54,180
What? You still doesn't believe
I am Lian Xinruo?

168
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,820
Well, I've turned into this now.

169
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,620
It's normal if you don't believe me.

170
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,298
A few days ago,
I questioned you thoroughly,

171
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:03,580
and you wouldn't admit it.

172
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,740
Why now suddenly reveal your identity?

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,380
My Father did such a wrong thing,

174
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,299
how could I admit it?

175
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,259
But now,
seeing the Lian family like this,

176
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,019
I have to return.

177
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,619
I cannot watch the Lian family
fall by my hands.

178
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,959
You must have suffered
a lot over these years.

179
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,260
Whether it was hard or not,
it's all past now.

180
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,179
Yao, I must reclaim the Lian family now.

181
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,619
For the sake of our past bond,

182
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,980
Yao, please help me.

183
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,219
Okay.

184
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,500
