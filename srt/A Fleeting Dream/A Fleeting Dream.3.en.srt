11
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:20,259
I'll do it myself.

12
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,518
Don't be stubborn.
If you don't treat it right,

13
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,219
it'll leave a scar.

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,499
Close your eyes.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,620
Close my eyes?

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,440
How am I supposed
to put on the medicine?

17
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:34,899
Or...

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,060
Just turn your face away.

19
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,659
This time,

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,340
I was careless.

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,140
It's not your fault.

22
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,459
None of us expected

23
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,740
Pei Yujie to strike out like that.

24
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,419
Good thing they see me
as a sickly weakling,

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,180
or things would've been much worse
for us in the Pei family.

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,139
But with your back like this,

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,299
the plan with the Lian family
might have to be postponed.

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,580
No.

29
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,379
I've waited five years for this day.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,300
Far too long.

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,780
I don't want to wait
even a single day more.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,180
I never expected you
would come to play chess with me.

33
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,579
Father said you're an excellent player.

34
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,220
I would like to learn from you.

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,340
But you're clearly not focused.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,820
Xueshan.

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,140
Are you keeping something from me?

38
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,460
No.

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,660
Of course no.

40
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,639
Jiang Yao, why are you here again?

41
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,620
Still putting on a show in front of me,

42
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,779
Xinruo?

43
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,299
I've told you many times.

44
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,700
I'm not Lian Xinruo.

45
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,919
Stop pestering me.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,719
Xinruo, you don't have
to be so guarded with me.

47
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,558
The Pei family isn't
as simple as you think.

48
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:35,100
You want to use Pei Yuze's power
to take back the Lian family, that's impossible.

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,959
If you really want to reclaim
the Lian family, I can help,

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,660
but now is not the right time.

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,679
Trust me.

52
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,620
I...

53
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,919
Jiang Yao, it seems my warning

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,479
meant nothing to you.

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,679
Uncle Yuze, don't blame Yao.

56
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,879
It was my idea.

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,299
I recognized Du...

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,518
I recognized Du Xinruo

59
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,099
by her birthmark.

60
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,038
Xinruo, we mean no harm.

61
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,758
Yao just wants to talk to you,

62
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,299
that's why I drew Uncle Yuze away.

63
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,459
Birthmark?

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,278
What birthmark?

65
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,340
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

66
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,819
How could that be?

67
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,999
I clearly saw the birthmark
on your lower back.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,220
Lower back?

69
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,499
Everyone abroad
knows the singer Meng Die,

70
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,439
but here in Hu City,

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,860
nobody does.

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,500
And you compare me to some courtesans?
What a bunch of bumpkins.

73
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,059
This farce is over.

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,399
Uncle Yuze, Miss Du.

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,380
Sorry, I got you wrong.

76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,380
Wait.

77
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,379
Apologize.

78
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,179
I'm sorry, Uncle Yuze.

79
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,259
Miss Du.

80
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,879
I didn't mean to offend.

81
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,100
Miss Du?

82
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,820
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,579
Aunt Youmeng.

84
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,899
I didn't mean to offend.

85
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,100
Uncle Yuze, Aunt Youmeng, I'm sorry.

86
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,219
Pei Yuze.

87
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,439
It's about time.

88
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,540
Get ready.

89
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,899
Master, here, take your medicine.

90
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,358
The Lian Manor is so big.

91
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,758
And no one's here to greet guests?

92
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,038
Second Master, Miss Du.

93
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,979
Here.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,479
Life, huh...

95
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,660
Just a few days ago,
Mr. Lian was full of vigor.

96
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,118
And now he's like this.

97
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,939
Truly, life is unpredictable.

98
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,019
The Lian Manor is so desolate.

99
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,699
No one's come to visit Mr. Lian
all these days.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,260
Seems like
Mr. Lian's not that well-liked.

101
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,419
Yuze, you may not know yet.

102
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,499
After what happened to Mr. Lian,

103
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,539
several of his concubines
ran off overnight with their wealth.

104
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,500
Not a trace of loyalty.

105
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,259
I heard they still haven't caught
the attacker.

106
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,118
Mr. Lian has too many enemies.

107
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,900
There are no leads even now.

108
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,220
I guess this matter

109
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,479
will likely just fade away.

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,798
So, you see.

111
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,358
People like Mr. Lian,
who've caused so much harm,

112
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,239
deserve it.

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,220
The entire Hu City is applauding.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,140
Mr. Lian.

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,860
Here, take your medicine.

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,220
Butler.

117
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,060
Yes, Master.

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,340
Mr. Lian spat out the medicine.

119
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,660
Come on, help me change his clothes.

120
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,959
How could I trouble you with this?

121
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,359
It's okay. Just a small favor.

122
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,179
Master.

123
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,299
Master.

124
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,339
Lian...

125
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,979
Lian Xinruo?

126
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:48,318
You must be Miss Xinya.

127
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,838
You've mistaken me for someone else.
My name is Du Youmeng.

128
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,539
I am Pei Yuze's fiancée.

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,660
Du Youmeng?

130
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,260
My father collapsed
at your engagement ceremony.

131
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,180
No, you are Lian Xinruo.

132
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,798
You came back for revenge.

133
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,198
Revenge? What do you mean?

134
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,079
Is Lian Xinruo's death
connected to you and your father?

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,740
What does it have to do with me?

136
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,439
That girl jumped into the sea herself.
It has nothing to do with me.

137
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,100
Miss Xinya, you don't need to explain.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,580
It's none of my business either.

139
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,580
Stop right there.

140
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,379
And what advice do you have for me,
Miss Xinya?

141
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,358
My father's paralyzed,

142
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,699
yet you sneak into my room.

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,758
You're here to steal
our family treasure, aren't you?

144
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,519
I don't even know the way
around your house.

145
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,980
I was looking for the restroom
and took a wrong turn.

146
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,820
Why make such a fuss?

147
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,358
I've seen plenty of shallow courtesans
like you.

148
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,299
Don't think being tied to the Pei family
will protect you.

149
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,020
Guards!

150
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:51,838
Miss.

151
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,819
Search her.

152
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,820
Wait.

153
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,259
At the very least, today I am still
a guest of the Lian family.

154
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,999
If you search me and find nothing
belonging to your family,

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,380
how will you explain yourself?

156
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,299
Here in the Lian Manor, I am the law.

157
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,838
If you refuse to be searched today,

158
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,699
you will not leave this manor.

159
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,459
Fine.

160
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,339
Search me if you want.

161
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,719
Then you do it yourself.

162
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,739
All right.

163
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,579
You're hiding it in there.

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,580
What are you standing around for? Do it.

165
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,940
Miss Lian.

166
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,060
We came out of kindness to visit,
yet you deliberately make things difficult.

167
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,179
Are you trying to make an enemy
of the Pei family?

168
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,419
Pei Yuze.

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,119
Just because your family's influential
in Hu City

170
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,020
doesn't mean you can run wild
in the Lian Manor.

171
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,820
You're nothing more
than a powerless heir.

172
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,659
You really think I'm afraid of you?

173
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,099
I'll remember what happened today.

174
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,179
One day, I'll return the favor
with a big gift.

175
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,979
Useless!

176
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,819
Go.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,940
Don't touch the one named Pei.

178
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,500
Teach this woman a lesson.

179
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,419
You've got a fever.

180
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,060
Is your wound infected?

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,839
I just had a bit of a headache
this morning.

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,079
I'll be fine after some rest.

183
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,300
