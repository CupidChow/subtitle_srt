11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,080
Thank you for supporting me,
Third Granduncle.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,359
Even if I die, I will make sure
the Pei family has a worthy head.

13
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,278
Fate can be cruel.

14
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,359
Pei Yuze!

15
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,359
Jiang Yao, what do you want now?

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,838
Pei Yuze, you're despicable!

17
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:26,720
You waited until now to make your move
and snatch the position from me!

18
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,078
You made me a laughingstock!

19
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,159
That calm, indifferent act you put on

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
all this time was all a disguise.

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,078
It's all because of you
that my big plan was ruined!

22
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,038
My five years of hard work wasted!

23
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,358
Yao, don't do this.

24
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,719
It's not over yet.

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,599
I still have a way!

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,879
Let me go!

27
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,879
Pei Yuze is the head of the family now.

28
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,119
What else can I do?

29
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,479
Yao,

30
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,118
he's been poisoned.

31
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,999
He has at most a month left.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,558
You don't have to worry.

33
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,199
How do you know he was poisoned?

34
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,439
Because I was the one who did it.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,800
What? You did it?

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
Yao, we just need him to die
before he officially takes over.

37
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,479
I have ways to convince the elders

38
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
to reinstate you as head.

39
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:39,038
But Pei Yuze is
at the Lian Residence now.

40
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,719
He's heavily guarded.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,278
How do we get to him?

42
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,799
I already have a plan for that.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
I only need your cooperation.

44
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,598
Yao,

45
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,439
I committed patricide for you.

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,080
There's no turning back now.

47
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,479
This time, we must succeed.

48
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,118
Xueshan, don't worry.

49
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:02,159
You've done so much for me
over the years.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,720
I won't let you down.

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,200
Xinruo, help me.

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
All done.

53
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,559
Thank you, Xinruo.

54
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,599
How did you get hurt so badly?

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,440
It was Pei Xueshan.
She tried to kill me.

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,399
Why would she do such a thing?

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,159
She wanted me to side with the Japanese

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,720
and poison Pei Yuze.

59
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,078
I haven't lost my mind to that extent.

60
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,358
When she couldn't convince me,

61
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:44,839
she decided to silence me.

62
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,199
What exactly is she plotting?

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,078
I don't know.

64
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,599
All I know is that a few Japanese
are under her command.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
She refuses to tell me anything else.

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,160
So what's your next move?

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
What else can I do?

68
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,880
I have nothing left here.

69
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,278
I'm leaving Hu City

70
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,719
and starting over.

71
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,999
Get some rest.

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,040
Don't worry. Once he's better,

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,360
I'll make him leave.

74
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,540
(Many days later)

75
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,239
Xinruo.

76
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,200
Have some breakfast.

77
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,318
You're recovering.

78
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,039
Why aren't you resting?

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
I've been troubling you all these days.

80
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,679
I plan to leave Hu City today.

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,760
Before I go,
I want to say a proper goodbye.

82
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,960
(Is Jiang Yao really leaving?)

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,520
I have nothing left now.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,360
I might as well
start fresh somewhere new.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,800
Pei Yuze, what happened
between us was my fault.

86
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,759
You're the family head now.

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,520
We're even.

88
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
Leave the past in the past.

89
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
Have a seat.

90
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,038
You always loved
my eight-treasure porridge.

91
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,919
I wanted to make it
for you one last time.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
But I don't have enough ingredients.

93
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,959
Mr. Pei, sorry,

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
there's none for you.

95
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,399
It's all right. I don't like sweets.

96
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,358
I haven't had this in years.

97
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,399
I almost forgot what it tasted like.

98
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,320
Eat up.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Pei Yuze, do you really think
I'd ever hurt Xinruo?

100
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,200
Before lighting the poison incense,

101
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,719
find a way to get Lian Xinruo
to take the antidote

102
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,079
to ensure your and her safety.

103
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,759
How does it taste?

104
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,799
Just like I remembered.

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,560
When are you leaving?

106
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,959
I want to pay respects to Mr. Lian
before I leave.

107
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,460
(Tablets of Beloved Father Lian Chen
and Beloved Mother Shuhua)

108
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,799
Yuze!

109
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,880
Xinruo!

110
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,919
- Xinruo!
- Xinruo!

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm so cold...

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,520
My chest hurts...

113
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,639
What's wrong?

114
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,679
Was I poisoned?

115
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,359
How could this be?

116
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,360
Why would Xinruo be the one poisoned?

117
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
Jiang Yao,

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,640
why would you hurt Xinruo?

119
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,999
No! It wasn't me! I would never!

120
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:57,319
Xinruo? Xinruo!

121
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,100
(Pei Residence)

122
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,358
Pei Xueshan, where are you?

123
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,919
Pei Xueshan, get out here!

124
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,079
Pei Xueshan, why did you lie to me?

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,240
Mr. Jiang.

126
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,278
Where's Pei Xueshan?

127
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,679
Where is she?

128
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,678
She went out last night
and hasn't come back.

129
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,198
Get out! Pei Xueshan, show yourself!

130
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,399
Pei Xueshan, get out here!

131
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,400
Give me the antidote.

132
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,758
I don't have it.

133
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,879
Pei Xueshan lied to me.

134
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,838
I gave Xinruo the antidote.

135
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,239
I don't know why she was poisoned.

136
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,639
You idiot.

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,678
You better pray I find the antidote.

138
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,239
Or I'll skin you alive!

139
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,199
Wen Yuan.

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,560
(Pei Family Ancestral Hall)
Stop! Don't run!

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
Jiang Yao, you can't escape.

142
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,519
If you're a man,

143
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,720
come out and take responsibility.

144
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,200
He's gone.

145
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,199
How could this happen?

146
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,720
There must be a secret passage
in the ancestral hall.

147
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:29,719
Go find it.

148
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,919
And seal off all information.

149
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,439
No word of this can get out.

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Understood.

151
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,199
I was careless.

153
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,399
This isn't your fault.

154
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,999
You were poisoned because you inhaled

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,560
that poison incense earlier.

156
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,400
I just wish
I'd known how much you suffered sooner.

157
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,679
All these years must have been hard.

158
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,040
I'd rather endure double the pain

159
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,720
than watch you suffer.

160
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,400
Yuze.

161
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not scared at all.

162
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,679
If you hadn't saved me five years ago,

163
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,679
I wouldn't be alive today.

164
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,719
Even if we don't find the antidote,

165
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,839
dying together wouldn't be

166
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
something I regret.

167
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,239
I won't let you die.

168
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,759
I believe in you.

169
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
Jiang Yao inhaled the poison incense
but wasn't poisoned,

170
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,640
which means
he must have taken the antidote.

171
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,119
Pei Xueshan lied when she said

172
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,280
there was no antidote.

173
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,599
You're right.

174
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,840
As long as we find Pei Xueshan,

175
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,039
we still have a chance.

176
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,760
Why can't

177
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,039
I find her?

178
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,159
Why?

179
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,199
It's all fake.

180
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,119
They've been using me.

181
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,599
It's all a lie!

182
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,719
Xinruo,

183
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,200
I didn't mean to...

184
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,600
If you die,

185
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,119
