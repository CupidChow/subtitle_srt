(Ledger)

12
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,799
The ledger looks fine.

13
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,399
Mr. Jiang, shouldn't this ledger

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
be shown to Second Master?

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,000
Did you forget who the family head is?

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Yes, of course.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,680
Why did you come in without knocking?

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,959
No need to be nervous, Mr. Jiang.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
I mean no harm.

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,800
I just want to discuss a deal.

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,318
The fact that I didn't call for help

22
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,038
already shows I'm letting you off easy.

23
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,078
As for a deal,

24
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,598
I have nothing to say to you.

25
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,199
Leave the Pei residence!

26
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,679
Jiang Yao.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Let's not beat around the bush.

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,679
You were involved in those shady deals

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,719
my brother ran before.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,440
So who are you trying
to fool with this act of innocence?

31
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,159
Now that I'm wanted,

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
I just want you
to help me leave Hu City.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,400
In return,

34
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,239
I can do something for you.

35
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,359
If you change your mind,

36
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,558
you know where to find me.

37
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,780
(No. 8, Beizongbu Alley, 3542)

(Memorial Tablet

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,119
After we found my father's remains
at the warehouse,

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
we buried him next to my mother's grave.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,720
Later, when you fell unconscious,

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,720
I kept praying to my parents.

44
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,598
I asked them to bless you

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,798
and help you

46
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,239
pull through.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,320
Looks like your parents really like me.

48
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,039
They made sure I woke up.

49
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,319
You brag whenever you get the chance.

50
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,679
Your parents need not worry.

51
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,719
I'll take good care of you.

52
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
I've asked Wen Yuan
to investigate who was

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,479
at the Pei residence
the day I was poisoned.

54
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,439
We should get a lead soon.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,320
Alright.

56
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,719
One more thing.

57
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,199
Jiang Yao asked
to meet me this afternoon.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
Are you reporting to me?

59
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,439
What if you start coughing blood again?

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Don't take too long.

61
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,519
Xinruo, do you
still remember this place?

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,999
I used to eat strawberry cake
alone every time.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
You weren't upset, were you?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,839
Alright then,
I won't let you have it this time.

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,239
No way!

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,719
Jiang Yao, it's over between us.

67
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,280
But I can't let go.

68
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,759
I can't lie to myself.

69
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,919
Whether it was five years ago or today,

70
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,400
my feelings for you have never changed.

71
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,558
I know Pei Yuze saved your life,

72
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,759
and you're grateful.

73
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,318
But you can't throw away your happiness

74
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,038
just to repay him.

75
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,119
Jiang Yao,
it's impossible between us now.

76
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,639
Besides, you're already
engaged to Xueshan.

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,838
You should devote yourself to her.

78
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,559
Don't let her down.

79
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,679
If it's because of her
that you're holding back,

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,639
don't worry.

81
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,959
I have no romantic feelings
for Xueshan at all.

82
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,079
But she just lost her father

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,199
and has no one else.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,439
I can't ask her for a divorce right now.

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,038
I'll leave her in good time.

86
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,879
Jiang Yao, I truly love Yuze.

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,000
I really want to be with him.

88
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,959
This is the last time
I'll explain it to you.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
From now on,
I won't meet you alone again.

90
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,400
Xinruo...

91
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,860
(Pei Residence)

92
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,598
I thought after the Master died,

93
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,358
Second Master would take over as head.

94
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,118
Who knew it would be Mr. Jiang instead?

95
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,038
Though the master
groomed him as his successor,

96
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,758
he's still an outsider by blood.

97
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,598
Can he really put
the Pei family above all else?

98
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,399
Second Master may be weak in health,

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,518
but if he and Miss Lian had a child now,

100
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,838
the family head position
would still pass down to him.

101
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,879
Exactly.

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,879
Master.

103
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,318
Dr. Fang, what brings you here?

104
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,439
Is Xueshan not feeling well?

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,078
Miss Xueshan caught a chill.

106
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,999
It might affect
tomorrow's Mid-Autumn banquet.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,399
So they asked me to check on her.

108
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, Dr. Fang.

109
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,558
Second Uncle just got discharged.

110
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,959
If you have time,
you should also check on him.

111
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,280
Second Uncle?

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,960
Dr. Fang, what's wrong?

113
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,999
Why don't you just say it?

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,639
There's something
I'm not sure if I should mention.

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,680
When Second Master
was hospitalized after being shot,

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,838
I happened to see his medical report.

117
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,838
It looked like his body
was perfectly fine.

118
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,039
Fine?

119
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,279
Everyone says he won't live past thirty.

120
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,199
But from that report,

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,598
his health seemed
no different from an ordinary man's.

122
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,439
There were no signs
of a serious illness.

123
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,199
Are you saying Pei Yuze
has been faking it?

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,758
Not exactly. He really did
fall ill when he was younger.

125
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,278
I was the one who treated him.

126
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,479
I can't be mistaken.

127
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,558
Maybe while he was overseas,
he found a good doctor

128
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,078
and has already recovered.

129
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,439
That'd be a blessing.

130
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,399
Master, I still have patients waiting.
I'll take my leave.

131
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,140
(Longevity with Grace)

132
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Faking illness?

133
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
(Blessed by Heaven and Earth)

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,120
Xueshan?

135
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,799
What's the matter?

136
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:06,838
No...

137
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,919
It's nothing.

138
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,840
What happened?

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival today.

140
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,039
Every year on this day,

141
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,999
no matter how busy Father was,

142
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,399
he'd always come home to have
dinner with me and watch the moon.

143
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
But now,

144
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't have any family left

145
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,480
on this day of reunion.

146
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,119
Xinruo...

147
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
I know I shouldn't blame or hate you.

148
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,719
But he was still my father.

149
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,359
My grief is too much to bear.

150
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,078
These grudges had
nothing to do with you.

151
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,558
It's natural you'd feel this way.

152
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,519
From now on, you don't have to hide it.

153
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
Xinruo.

154
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,040
I know Yao has always loved you.

155
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,679
If you still care about him,

156
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,039
I'm willing to step aside
and let you two be together.

157
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,479
Jiang Yao and I
were over a long time ago.

158
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,759
That's all in the past.

159
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,038
I won't dwell on it.

160
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,358
If you truly love him,

161
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,079
then be with him wholeheartedly.

162
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,599
Second Master,
should I serve the mooncakes now

163
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,638
or wait until we enjoy
the moon in the garden?

164
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,198
Wait until we're outside.

165
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,119
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,879
And the gifts from each household?

167
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,638
Should I hand them out to the stewards?

168
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,238
Pick out some treats for the children

169
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,879
and send them
to the orphanage in Hu City.

170
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,080
Yes, sir.

171
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,479
Yao, eat up.

172
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,119
Are you full?

173
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,278
Then, let's take a walk outside.

174
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,239
Alright.

175
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,119
Yao, you're the family head now,

176
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,040
yet they only listen to Second Uncle.

177
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,040
Yao?

178
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,679
Yao!

179
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,540
(Spider Dispels Wind and Poison)

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,519
What are you doing?

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,559
You look serious.

182
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,439
The remedies we tried
these past few days barely worked.

183
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,678
So I'm wondering which one

184
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,079
we should try tomorrow.

185
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,559
Stop it.

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,760
It's useless.

187
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,240
You think I don't know anything?

188
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,879
Tell me.

189
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,000
What should I do?

190
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,519
Do nothing?

191
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Just watch you die before my eyes?

192
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,319
I can't do it.

193
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,079
I feel like the most useless person.

194
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,360
You really don't need to do all this.

195
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,560
As long as you're with me,

196
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,800
that is

197
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,360
the greatest comfort I'll ever need.

198
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,319
Besides,

199
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,238
I'm not exactly

200
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,039
a sickly man with one foot in the grave.

201
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,160
If we really sparred,

202
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,199
you might not even be my match.

203
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,238
I don't care.

204
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,799
You're such a big head.

205
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,879
You don't believe me?

206
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,400
Try me.

207
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,119
Pei Yuze, stop messing around.

208
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,160
You always...

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm not messing around.

210
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,359
Pei Yuze.

211
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,559
You...

212
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,480
You...

213
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
What's wrong this time?

214
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,439
Pei Yuze?

215
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm not feeling well.

216
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,638
Put me down.

217
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,079
You tricked me again.

218
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,120
Put me down!

219
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,439
Yao, you've had enough.

220
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,760
It's bad for your health.

221
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,999
Leave me alone.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,080
Get out.

223
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,400
Yao.

224
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,599
Please take good care of yourself.

225
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
(Do you want to know)

226
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,679
(if Xinruo truly has me in her heart?)

227
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,360
I told you,

228
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,879
you can't beat me.

229
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,838
Jiang Yao.

230
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,678
It's over between us.

231
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,399
(Though the master
groomed him as his successor,)

232
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,119
he's still an outsider by blood.

233
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,959
Can he really put
the Pei family above all else?

234
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,678
(Maybe while he was overseas,
he found a good doctor)

235
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,919
and has already recovered.

236
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,678
Jiang Yao, I truly love Yuze.

237
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,599
I really want to be with him.

238
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,919
Yao, you're the family head now,

239
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,720
yet they only listen to Second Uncle.

240
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,480
I worked so hard to climb my way up

241
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
from a secretary's son to this.

242
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,599
I worked so hard
to bring down Pei Yujie.

243
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,198
Why are you fighting me for it?

244
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,079
You have no right!

245
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,400
I will be the family head.

246
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,960
Xinruo will be mine!

247
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,640
Yuze.

248
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,039
It's so hot.

249
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320
I want some ice.

250
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,959
Jiang Yao.

251
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,758
Why are you here? Where's Yuze?

252
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,358
Pei Yuze is no match for me now.

253
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,359
I'm the family head now.

254
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:56,039
The Pei family is mine.

255
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,399
And you're mine too.

256
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
Are you out of your mind?
I'm your Second Aunt now.

257
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,119
You're the one who needs to wake up.

258
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,439
We used to love each other so much.

259
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,758
Did you forget all of it?

260
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,639
Besides, that sickly Pei Yuze
is about to die.

261
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,639
I'm your only choice.

262
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,479
Oh, really?

263
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,358
Jiang Yao, as long as I'm here,

264
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,239
neither the head position nor Xinruo

265
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,400
will ever belong to you.

266
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,960
Pei Yuze, I'll kill you!

267
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,719
Xinruo!

268
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,119
You...

269
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,638
Do you have no shame?

270
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,319
This is called a sound tactic.

271
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:56,999
This is called turning the tables.

272
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,000
Fine, I admit defeat. Happy?

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,640
How about we keep competing?

274
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,839
Compete in what?

275
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,160
Let's see

276
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,360
which of us

277
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,319
