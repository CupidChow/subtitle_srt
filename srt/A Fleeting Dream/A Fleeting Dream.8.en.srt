=Episode 8=

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,919
Everyone must have already
heard about Xinya's situation.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,798
This is a turbulent time
for the Lian family.

13
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,239
So we must choose who will take
the lead of the Lian family.

14
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,879
No one is more qualified to be
the head of the Lian family

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,000
than Miss Xinruo.

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,838
Yes, I choose Miss Xinruo.

17
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:28,598
Agreed.

18
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,559
Thank you for your support.
I will do my best for the Lian family...

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,558
Not so fast. She's not qualified to be
the head of the Lian family.

20
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,479
She's not even one of the Lian family.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,759
You're nothing but a fraud!

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,559
You're not the real Miss Xinruo!

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,919
Yao uncovered evidence

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,840
proving Miss Du's identity is fake.

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,758
To protect the Lian family's assets,

26
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,999
I have no choice
but to reveal this will.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,919
Everyone knows Mr. Lian had
only one daughter, Xinya.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,879
Mr. Lian feared that
if something happened to him,

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,278
Xinya wouldn't be able to manage
the entire family,

30
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,038
so he prepared this will for me

31
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,599
to temporarily oversee the Lian family.

32
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,318
I didn't want
to present this will either,

33
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,439
but the Lian family

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,118
cannot fall
into the hands of an outsider.

35
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:39,199
I must honor Mr. Lian's last wishes.

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,240
Any objections?

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,380
(Pei Residence)

38
00:02:58,799 --> 00:02:59,799
Stop right there.

39
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,078
We had a deal.

40
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,599
You betrayed me.

41
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,838
Miss Du, you're far too naive.

42
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,838
As the next head of the Pei family,

43
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,798
all of its assets belong to me.

44
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,399
Why would I ever abandon the Pei family

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,880
to work with you?

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,479
I've heard all about you.

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,758
Your father was only the secretary
to the Lian family head back then.

48
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,118
Shortly after the head died,

49
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,479
you abandoned Lian Xinruo

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
and quickly went after Pei Xueshan.

51
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,558
You don't love anyone.

52
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,879
Everyone around you is just
a stepping stone to climb higher...

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Lian family and I share
a blood feud over my father's death!

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,318
How could I possibly stay with Xinruo?

55
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,399
My feelings for Xinruo
have never changed.

56
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,240
You don't deserve to even say her name.

57
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,999
That proves you never
cared about Pei Xueshan.

58
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,318
You're free to mock me all you want.

59
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,758
But after today,

60
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,599
I doubt you can even stay in Hu City.

61
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,759
We'll see

62
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,239
about that.

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,639
Since you returned

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,479
to the country,

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,879
all you've done is rest at home

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,159
or make merry with Miss Du.

67
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,078
I almost forgot

68
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,118
when you were young,

69
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:20,360
our father and the elder clan members
praised you as clever beyond your years,

70
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,999
the perfect candidate to be family head.

71
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,519
What do you mean by that?

72
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:33,679
I never doubted you were smart.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,879
You must have seen through

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,800
Miss Du's identity all along.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,760
So all this time you've been
supporting her behind the scenes.

76
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,239
If Youmeng wants something,

77
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,399
I'll help her get it.

78
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,278
What Du Youmeng wants?

79
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,038
Or what you want?

80
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,999
Why beat around the bush?

81
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,559
That's a strange thing to say.

82
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,479
You acquired the Lian family's assets

83
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,199
through less than honest methods.

84
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,839
Everyone's just using their own skills.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,999
The blood running through the Pei family

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,040
is that of acquisitors.

87
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,439
I might let this slide this time,

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,758
but Du Youmeng must leave the Pei family

89
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,119
and Hu City.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,080
That's not happening.

91
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,200
Yuze, don't test my patience.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't worry.

93
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,959
I don't intend to make an enemy of you.

94
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
My time is limited.

95
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,239
I just want to be with the one I love.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,760
Now that you have the Lian family,

97
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,759
please stop making things hard
for Youmeng.

98
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,038
I didn't expect Lian Xinya
would be silenced so quickly.

99
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,079
They act without any scruples.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,000
Because they've never had
to pay for their crimes.

101
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
Now is not the right time

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
to reclaim the Lian family.

103
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,639
Don't be hasty.

104
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,399
I've come to realize,

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,598
whether I am Lian Xinruo or not,

106
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,118
Pei Yujie is determined
to seize the Lian family.

107
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,479
You stopped me from continuing
to oppose him today

108
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
because you're worried about me.

109
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,479
You're worried he might target me

110
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,240
and make it harder for me to track down
leads about my father's disappearance.

111
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,439
Lian Xinya didn't know
the truth about your father.

112
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,080
You'll need to find an opportunity
to meet with Lian Zhong.

113
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,679
The problem is,

114
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,758
I've confronted Pei Yujie many times.

115
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,559
Won't he come after me too?

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Then let him hesitate to make a move

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640
and think twice
before acting against you.

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
It's time to make use

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,760
of your identity as a singer, Meng Die.

120
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,460

captivating, stunning red lips)

121

he's made Du Youmeng
Hu City's top celebrity.

131
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,040
She's just a lowly performer,
nothing more.

132
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,919
Don't pay her any mind.

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,680
Master Pei!

134
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,479
There are a lot of reporters outside
blocking the front gate.

135
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,199
They're all here to interview Miss Du.

136
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,839
This is unacceptable.

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,758
Send them all away.

138
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,839
Yes, sir.

139
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,319
Master Pei.

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,439
What now?

141
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,239
The Commanding Officer's wife

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,800
just sent a formal visit request.

143
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,399
Tell the butler to prepare for her visit.
She must be received with the highest honor.

144
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,480
Yes, sir.

145
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,879
The Hu City Commander is always aloof.

146
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,838
He never mingles with merchants.

147
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,999
For his wife
to visit us all of a sudden,

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,639
could they want to foster ties with us?

149
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,598
Yao, go change.

150
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,879
We'll greet them together.

151
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,920
Understood.

152
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,999
Madam.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
Welcome, welcome...

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
Miss Du.

155
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,919
We meet at least.

156
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,799
My daughter and I

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,359
are both your fans.

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,758
I heard you're releasing a new single.

159
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,519
When will the album come out?

160
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,399
Yes, when's the release date?

161
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,999
Ladies, be patient.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,158
Let's go inside and talk.

163
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,238
- Of course.
- All right.

164
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,119
Please.

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,759
My daughter knew

166
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,198
I was coming today.

167
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,239
She insisted I bring along

168
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,039
a case of "Keke Cola."

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,399
She said since you returned from abroad,

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,599
you must love this drink.

171
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,879
Young folks are the only ones
who like these newfangled things.

172
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,479
I'm not used to drinking that.

173
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,999
That's very thoughtful of you.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,919
Next time

175
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,638
I'll bring my new album over
to visit you.

176
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,999
That would be wonderful.

177
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,199
Here.

178
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,879
Oh, my.

179
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,040
Second Master and Miss Du
are such a loving couple.

180
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,198
This is the first time I've seen a woman
playing mahjong with a man

181
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,999
waiting on her hand and foot.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Madam Hou, you tease us.

183
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,879
I'm just a carefree soul

184
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,758
who can only
take care of my lover at home.

185
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,399
I can't compare
to the well-known Mr. Hou.

186
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,838
No matter how much praise
he gets outside,

187
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,639
at home he's still a clueless,
unsentimental blockhead.

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,280
He hasn't a single romantic bone.

189
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
Take it from someone who's been around.

190
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:43,919
You two are young.
Get married soon and have a child.

191
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,239
That's what really matters.

192
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,278
Eight bamboo.

193
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,599
That's right.

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,840
Ever since my husband took a concubine,

195
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,838
he hasn't even touched me.

196
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:53,799
Red.

197
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,039
I'll take that.

198
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,759
I'll go get some more soda.

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,999
Ladies, you don't know this.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,678
Yuze's health

201
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,238
hasn't been great lately,

202
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,838
and he's on medicine.

203
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,919
Men and their pride.

204
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,600
Please don't tease him too much.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,999
No laughing.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,278
Look at me.

207
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,638
I really should mind my tongue.

208
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,519
Enough of that.

209
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,680
Let's get back to the game.

210
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,919
I win!

211
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,318
Oh, my.

212
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,318
Look at her tiles.

213
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:26,758
She's so lucky.

214
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,678
My luck's good today.

215
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,278
Butler, get the car ready!

216
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,599
I'm heading out!

217
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
Uncle Zhong, it's me.

218
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,798
You must know who I am by now.

219
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,198
I'll ask you a few questions.

220
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,999
Blink once for yes.

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,520
Twice for no.

222
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,520
Is my father dead?

223
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,439
Did you kill him?

224
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:38,959
Then who did it?

225
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,520
Was it Pei Yujie?

226
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,520
Yujie. Yujie!

227
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
All right, Peirong.

228
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Talk.

229
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,399
I was going to have my men
quietly take care of Lian Zhong.

230
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,638
But a woman showed up.

231
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,198
My men didn't know their limits

232
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,039
and used a knife.

233
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,640
We'll have to come up with a story

234
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,718
to explain Lian Zhong's cause of death.

235
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,079
A woman?

236
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,638
She had her face covered,

237
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,319
and the room was pitch black.

238
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,000
But my men said

239
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,439
her silhouette resembled Du Youmeng.

240
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,800
Du Youmeng?

241
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,239
(Du Youmeng?)

242
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,158
Du Youmeng wouldn't be interested

243
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,359
in Lian Zhong who's lost value to them.

244
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,720
But Lian Xinruo

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,920
is a different matter.

246
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,198
Yujie, you mean Du Youmeng

247
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,119
is Lian Xinruo?

248
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,720
I can't be certain yet.

249
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,278
Don't worry.

250
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,879
That woman was stabbed on her right arm.

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,999
Even if we don't catch anyone today,

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,120
we need only examine her arm tomorrow.

253
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
If it really was Lian Xinruo,

254
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,719
then she must have come
looking for Lian Zhong

255
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,678
about Lian Chen's death.

256
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,399
Lian Zhong can't speak anymore.

257
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,280
What could she even find out?

258
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,920
No one but you and me

259
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,480
knows Lian Chen is dead,

260
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,360
and no one knows it was us who killed
Lian Chen and Jiang Mingcheng.

261
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,980
(Pei Residence)

262
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
What happened?

263
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,239
Lian Zhong confessed.

264
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,999
Pei Yujie killed my father.

265
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,759
I stopped hoping a long time ago.

266
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,640
But when I heard him admit it,

267
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,040
I just couldn't help it...

268
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,199
Cry it out.

269
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,920
You'll feel better.

270
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,759
No.

271
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,040
The most important thing now

272
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,960
is to find my father's body.

273
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
I must avenge him.

274
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,800
Don't worry.

275
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,199
I'll help you.

276
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,238
(Pei Residence)

277
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,959
Master! Master!

278
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,880
Look who's here!

279
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,160
Police investigation.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,599
Chief Wu, what's with the big operation

281
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,240
this early in the morning?

282
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,999
(Police)
Mr. Lian Zhong was murdered last night.

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
According to eyewitness accounts,

284
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,959
the attacker resembled Miss Du.

285
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,358
Chief Wu, do you have any evidence?

286
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,520
Of course.

287
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,840
The killer was wounded
on the right arm last night.

288
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,079
If Miss Du allows us to examine her arm,

289
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,960
the truth will come out.

290
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,758
Miss Du, I believe you're innocent.

291
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,238
But Chief Wu is just doing his job.

292
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,599
Please cooperate.

293
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,960
Absolutely not.

294
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,840
You don't even have any evidence and
you're dragging her name through the mud.

295
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,599
Yuze is right.

296
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,880
I have a reputation in Hu City.

297
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,479
If I let you check my arm,

298
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,238
how can I face anyone if this leaks out?

299
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,879
If you don't cooperate,

300
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
I'll have no choice
but to use more violent means.
