13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,960
Qian's had quite a scare.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,160
Quick, take her back
to her room to rest.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
Send more guards
and tighten her protection.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,840
Your Majesty, perhaps it's better
to leave her with me.

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,960
Qianqian.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,640
Qian.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
Let's go to get some rest.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,880
Go on.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't be scared.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,680
- You're safe now.
- Here.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Come here, Qianqian.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
Let's go get some rest.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,790
- Don't be scared, Qianqian.
- Help her!

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
There, there.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's head back now.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
Hua Qingming.

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,440
You've actually dared
to come to the City Lord's Manor?

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,960
You've certainly got guts.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Guards!

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,200
Your Majesty, it was thanks
to Hua Qingming and Yue Qianxue

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,320
that we were able
to locate Her Highness.

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,460
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
He's right, Father.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,560
Even though I came up with and executed

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,760
the rescue plan,

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,400
Hua Qingming and Yue Qianxue
also played a big role

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,080
in it.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,760
Also, based on my investigation,

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Lu Li's matter has nothing
to do with Hua Qingming.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,320
Silence!

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,360
Ping.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,320
You think
I don't know your capabilities?

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm your father after all.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Whether I'm capable or not,

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,720
I've got to weigh in
at least 180 catties.

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Humph!

49
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm willing
to stake the City Lord's Token.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,780
Please give us
a bit more time, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,720
I swear I'll help Lord Zhenbei
uncover the truth behind Lu Li's treason.

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
Ye Weiming.

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
Are you treating the City Lord's Token

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,680
like it's a toy?

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
I wouldn't dare.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,000
It's just my way of showing my resolve.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,710
Please show some mercy, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,320
Please show some mercy, Father!

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Fine.

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
You have three days.

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,880
I won't pursue
Lord Zhenbei's crimes for now.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,040
But after three days,

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,560
if the truth isn't found,

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,240
every single one of you

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
will be sacrificed to the heavens!

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,760
Father!

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,440
You...

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
You're going to sacrifice your own son?

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
Yue.

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
We haven't been back here in ages.

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,920
Indeed. Luckily, things are starting
to come together now.

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,680
That's true.

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,200
How dare you!

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
Surrender now!

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
Fugitives Hua Qingming and Yue Qianxue,

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,040
I've finally caught you!

78
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,040
Come with me to the City Lord's Manor
and face justice!

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Stop right there!

80
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,880
Yao Wei.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
It's the middle of the night.

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
Instead of tending to the City Lord
in the manor,

83
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
you're here making a scene, huh?

84
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
You've crossed the line, no?

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
The City Lord's Manor?

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,080
I haven't been there in days
as I've tried to catch these criminals.

87
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Ye Weiming,

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
don't you dare act out.

89
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
I outrank you, you know.

90
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,840
Oh, really?

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,240
How domineering you are!

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Your Highness.

93
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,760
What's wrong?

94
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
Lost your seal?

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,880
Your words don't carry
much weight anymore, huh?

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,880
Looks like only I,
the Crown Prince, still hold sway.

97
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,880
You.

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Get over here.

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Scram.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,840
Well...

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
My father already gave in,

102
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
and you're still nagging here?

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,640
Get lost already!

104
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,760
Let's go.

105
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
How is she doing?

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,400
Her Highness isn't seriously hurt.

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,040
She just caught some damp-cold.

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,560
A bath with a bit of evodia and mugwort
should get rid of it.

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,600
You two, go prepare it.

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
Qianqian.

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,440
Don't be afraid.

113
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm here.

114
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,640
You're safe now.

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

116
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
You may all leave.

117
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
Qianqian.

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,640
Don't be afraid.

120
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm right here.

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,600
No way.

122
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,640
Darn it.

123
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,080
It's just a piece of wood!

124
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,488
Master ordered you
to take the Earth Seal Scroll

125
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,760
to Changping Capital.

126
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,400
From there, push things forward slowly.

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,200
There's a six-pointed star birthmark
on Lu Qianqian's back shoulder,

128
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
which is a mark
of the Overlord Star reborn.

129
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,440
A six-pointed star?

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,080
A six-pointed star.

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,040
The Earth Seal Scroll.

132
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,840
That's right.

133
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,560
The Earth Seal Scroll.

134
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
Given the situation now,

135
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,080
unless we ask Her Highness directly,

136
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
we won't get any answers.

137
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,760
She's been lying low
in Changping Capital

138
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,040
for over ten years.

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,880
Getting any intel out of her

140
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,500
is like asking a tiger for its skin.

141
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,320
Besides...

142
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,640
What is it?

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
She's incredibly cunning.

144
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
When I was interrogating
that black-robed intruder

145
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,013
caught in the City Lord's Manor,

146
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,520
Her Highness pretended to question him.

147
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,600
But she got herself taken hostage
at the critical moment.

148
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,120
But the rope that tied him up

149
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,920
was clearly slashed with a blade.

150
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,800
And she was
the only one there at the time.

151
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,600
Looking back now,

152
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,720
she used me to silence him

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
to destroy the evidence

154
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,440
and cover her tracks.

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,040
She's extremely meticulous.

156
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,000
Getting any intel out of her
is nearly impossible.

157
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
If only we could find that mysterious
person Yue Yong mentioned.

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,280
Donghuang Bell.

159
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,840
Since the Donghuang Bell
brought Yue and me back,

160
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,000
maybe it could help us

161
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,400
go back
to the 45th year of the Mingdu era.

162
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Well...

163
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
That seems impossible.

164
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Who's there?

165
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
It's me, Your Majesty.

166
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Ah, it's you, honey.

167
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,760
Come on in.

168
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,200
It's late. What brings you here, honey?

169
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
You've been working so hard lately,

170
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,040
so I brewed
some deer antler tea just for you.

171
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Also...

172
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,560
I wonder

173
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,320
if the Earth Seal Scroll
has been safely kept.

174
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,080
Well...

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,960
I just checked on it earlier.

176
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,280
And somehow, it's gone.

177
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
Gone?

178
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,760
I entrusted you with a divine artifact
meant to protect our nation

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
and you lost it?

180
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
Well, it's not entirely impossible.

181
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,720
How strange.

182
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
Why has the Donghuang Bell's power

183
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,880
turned from gold to red?

184
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,720
One incense stick's worth of time.

185
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,520
What do you mean, sir?

186
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,000
The Donghuang Bell's power
to go back in time

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
can indeed send you
to Year 45 of Mingdu.

188
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,080
But in its current state,

189
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,320
it can only hold for one incense's time.

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,040
If you don't make it back

191
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
when time's up...

192
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,480
What happens?

193
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,560
Your souls will be destroyed.

194
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,480
Sir.

195
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
Why can't I go with them?

196
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,560
They've lost their inner strength.

197
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
With me there, I could protect them.

198
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
It's not that we won't send you.

199
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,680
It's that the Donghuang Bell
doesn't have the power to send you.

200
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,920
Ye Weiming.

201
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,200
The ten great ancient divine artifacts

202
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,640
can carry everything under heaven.

203
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,040
But they...

204
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,560
can't carry themselves.
