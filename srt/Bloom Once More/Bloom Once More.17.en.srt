13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,920
Later on,

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,400
I started having doubts too.

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Well...

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,040
She started
acting stranger and stranger.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,920
It was like...

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,560
She had completely
forgotten everything about the city.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,480
And...

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,400
Her temper and personality
changed drastically too.

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
She is not Her Highness at all.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,393
She's just an impostor
disguised as Her Highness

23
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,440
to infiltrate Changping Capital.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
In fact,

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,960
I'd been suspecting it for a long time.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
But...

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,680
But since I was young,

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Ping's mother and I
had been childhood sweethearts.

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,040
We truly loved each other.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,400
Without absolute certainty,

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,200
I...

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I didn't dare pierce
that final veil of doubt.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
That day, His Majesty brought me
to the City Lord's Manor.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,120
I thought I was going to die there.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
But I never imagined he and I
were the same kind of people.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Hah, so it was Hongyue!

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Speak!

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Did you and Hongyue collude
and do something to my wife?

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,240
Hongyue is such a kind girl.

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,500
There's no way she would've
harmed Her Highness with me.

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Besides,

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,320
I've been searching
for Hongyue's whereabouts all these years.

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,920
It's me who should be asking you.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,400
Where did you people hide Hongyue?

45
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:27,873
Why have I never seen her

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,440
again?

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,400
You're as short-tempered as me.

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,120
What's your name?

49
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Weichen.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,880
Weichen of the Tianji Pavilion?

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,000
The Tianji Pavilion has protected

52
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,795
Changping Capital's
national divine artifact,

53
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:00,800
the Donghuang Bell,
for a thousand years.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
Besides,

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
those of Tianji Pavilion
are bound by sacred oath.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,760
They would never do anything
to harm Changping Capital.

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,920
Weichen and Hongyue's bond
was just like mine with her.

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,400
We understood each other
deeply from the start.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
His Majesty respected that I was
a descendant of the shaman clan,

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,720
so he told me
about the Earth Seal Scroll.

61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,360
When I saw the Earth Seal Scroll,

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,480
I could feel it
held extraordinary power.

63
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,240
Unfortunately,
my cultivation was too shallow

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
to decipher its mysteries.

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,480
So I stayed hidden in the secret chamber

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
to investigate alongside His Majesty

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,240
the truth behind Her Highness
and the Earth Seal Scroll.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,680
I believed
that once we uncovered the truth,

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,520
I'd definitely see you again.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,520
Later on,

71
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,920
I don't even know what happened,

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,280
but my health just kept declining.

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Eventually,
I couldn't even get out of bed.

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
But...

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
But...

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,560
Changping Capital cannot go a day
without a ruler.

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,280
After much thought...

78
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,480
I asked Weichen
to disguise himself as me

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,000
to be my eyes, my mouth,

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,360
to maintain peace
in Changping Capital for me.

81
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
At the same time,

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,960
he was to continue the investigation.

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
Over the years,

84
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,050
I've searched

85
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,750
for documents that could unlock
the secret of the Earth Seal Scroll.

86
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
But to no avail.

87
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,680
Once, I went to the storage pavilion

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,680
to study the structure
of the Earth Seal Scroll.

89
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,200
But I didn't expect
Lu Li was guarding the pavilion.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,520
I feared my presence would be exposed,

91
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,040
so from that day on,

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,840
every time I went
to the storage pavilion,

93
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
I disguised myself as Her Highness.

94
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
So no one would grow suspicious of me.

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
I see.

96
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
The City Lord was poisoned gradually.

97
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,240
It was likely Hailing Incense.

98
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,720
Hailing Incense?

99
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,960
It comes from Western Niuhe Plain.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Its subtle scent excites the senses,

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,960
but over time,

102
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,560
it drains your life.

103
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,900
You waste away like a dying flame.

104
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,000
No wonder I too
have been sluggish these past years.

105
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,920
I always lose my temper,

106
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,800
and I'm even hallucinating at times.

107
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,360
Her Highness always lit incense herself

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
in our room every day.

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,560
That must've been Hailing Incense.

110
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Qianqian.

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,120
Feeling good?

112
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,560
Breathe it in deeply.
You'll feel even better.

113
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,400
Lass.

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,720
I saved your life back then.

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,800
This pitiful life of yours

116
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
has always belonged to me.

117
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Now...

118
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,680
it's time to give it back.

119
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,880
Who's there?

120
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm Yao Wei. A physician from Western Plain
seeks audience outside.

121
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,490
That's a divine healer
I hired from Western Plain

122
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,470
to prepare a calming prescription
for His Majesty.

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Bring him in now.

124
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,560
Yes.

125
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,520
Why did that fool
come through the main gate?

126
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,320
I, Hua Qingming, am willing
to arrest the fake Her Highness.

127
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,240
I shall investigate all the cases thoroughly,

128
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
including Her Highness's attack,

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
the injustice against Hongyue,

130
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
the Princess's replacement,

131
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,600
Lu Li's treason,

132
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
the impersonation of Her Majesty,

133
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
(Earth Seal Scroll)
and the plot to destroy the kingdom.

134
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,960
I ask for Majesty's permission

135
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
to look into these cases.

136
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,400
You brought me here
to swap your face with that girl's?

137
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,560
What happened 18 years ago
is already exposed.

138
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,640
I can no longer stay here
in Changping Capital.

139
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,120
It was you
who changed my face back then.

140
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
Now...

141
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
you have to help me again.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,440
Help you?

143
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,280
Master gave you a death order.

144
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,840
If you fail the mission,

145
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,680
you won't need to return to Ximu at all.

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,960
Now that the plot has been revealed,

147
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,960
do you think Master will spare you?

148
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,720
Why not help me instead?

149
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,080
I've saved up a fortune
in Changping Capital over the years.

150
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,080
I'll give you half of that.

151
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,720
Let's disappear
from this world completely.

152
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,400
That would be the best option

153
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,160
for us both.

154
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,360
How much?

155
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
Enough to buy half the city.

156
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,720
I want it in silver.

157
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
Go.

158
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,600
I want her alive.

159
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,280
There are things I need to ask her.

160
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,960
Yes.

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
It hurts, Mother!

162
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,680
Mother, I'm Qianqian!

163
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
You're Qianqian?

164
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,200
You fool!

165
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
You're just a fake I picked up

166
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,800
eighteen years ago at a mass grave!

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,160
Get in!

168
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,520
What did you say?

169
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,560
Listen here.

170
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,680
Your life

171
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,600
is no different from a stray dog's.

172
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,880
I gave you eighteen years of life

173
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,120
and luxury you never deserved!

174
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
You can return it to me now.

175
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,400
Right? That's not too much to ask, no?

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,040
Mother!

177
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
My child...

178
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,280
Don't blame me.

179
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,160
Every man for himself,

180
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,400
and devil take the hindmost.

181
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,280
The plan

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,320
has failed.

183
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,200
If it had succeeded,

184
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,600
perhaps I

185
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
could've made you

186
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,480
a noble lady ruling a region.

187
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,840
In

188
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,000
another

189
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,520
life,

190
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,160
then.

♪In the misty mortal world,
my teary eyes brim with unspoken words♪

192
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,250
♪Longing weaves
through the night wind like thread♪

193
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,580
♪Who can unravel old dreams
and tangled grudges of the past?♪

194
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,480
♪A lone lamp burns through the night,
stained by endless zephyr♪

195
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,460
♪Half a life adrift and swaying,
where does a fleeting soul belong?♪

196
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,690
♪Love and hate vanish in a blink,
leaving only emptiness♪

197
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,690
♪With flowers fallen and the moon gone,
a season together turns to sorrow♪

198
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,250
♪Fate begins and ends,
but who was I meant to live for?♪

199
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,910
♪Time rushes by,
leaving parting songs with eternity♪

200
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,650
♪Love stays foolish,
and farewells never end♪

201
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,050
♪With a parting song, I take your hand♪

202
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,950
♪Together, even worlds apart,
we live as one♪

203
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,790

into ailing dreams♪
