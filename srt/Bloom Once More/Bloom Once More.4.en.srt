Say something, Yue.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,300
Yue!

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
Yue.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm here.

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,480
Yue.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,320
Silly.

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,640
What are you doing?

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,580
It's time for our wedding ceremony.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Qingming, help me...

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,240
Qingming...

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,880
Help me...

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Yue!

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Yue!

Please let go!

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Your Lordship!

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
Your Lordship, you're awake!

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,950
You're awake, Your Lordship!!

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,160
Lord Zhennan!

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
His Lordship is awake!

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
How long was I out?

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
About four hours.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Four hours.

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Four hours.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
Yue...

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,120
Yue!

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Where's Yue?

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
She was taken right before your eyes!

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,160
I should be asking you that!

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,640
From now on, you'll be Yue Qianxue.

45
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,880
Can you manage?

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,840
I'm fine.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,160
There must still be
traces of snake venom in my body.

48
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,990
There are no bamboo groves
in Changping Capital.

49
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
Where did these bamboo leaves come from?

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Mount Zhubi.

51
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
The only bamboo forest

52
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,190
near Changping Capital
grows on Mount Zhubi.

53
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,520
Mount Zhubi.

54
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,920
Where is Mount Zhubi located?

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,960
About five li southwest
from the west city gate.

56
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,800
I used to go there often
when I was in the city garrison.

57
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
Wait.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,390
Mount Zhubi is 800 zhang tall,
and stretches over 3,000 zhang.

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,550
The bamboo forest covers hundreds of mu.

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,690
Even if we searched for ten days,
we would not finish.

61
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,520
But we cannot just give up.

62
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,320
Only in mountain caves
that face away from the sun and have

63
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,910
long-term wind currents
can plants develop

64
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
the kind of damp,
yellow-veined pattern seen here.

65
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,830
Based on my past experience
as a city garrison guard,

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
there are a few caves

67
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,980
on the northwest side of Mount Zhubi
that fit those characteristics.

68
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,190
You still have not recovered
from the snake venom.

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,080
Let me go instead.

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
Have you lost your mind?

71
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,000
If you try to circulate your energy now,

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
it will rupture your meridians.

73
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
You will die!

74
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,240
Why don't you come home with me?

75
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,680
From now on, my home is your home.

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800

tell me.

89
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,690
If I have to stay behind alone
in Luori City,

90
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,640
and Changping Capital can no longer
send any help,

91
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,760
would you come to save me?

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,240
I would.

You're not getting out of here alive.

99
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,080
But before you die,
I'll let you indulge in some pleasure.

100
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,720
Yue,

101
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm here.

102
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh!

103
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,720
Lord Zhenbei!

104
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
I was wrong!

105
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,120
Spare me,

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Oh?

109
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,000
So you've been poisoned.

110
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Even poisoned,

111
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
I can still kill you.

112
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,080
Changping Capital is rotten to the core.

113
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
Once Yue Qianxue dies,

114
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,640
Changping Capital will belong to Ximu.

115
