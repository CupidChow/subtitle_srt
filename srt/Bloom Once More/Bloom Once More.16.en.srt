What?

My mother is a fake?

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,840
Lu Buping.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,440
Do you really believe what I'm saying?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,200
I do. Of course I believe you.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Look.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,040
This is the result
of me practicing lightness skill

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,840
based on the cultivation manual
you gave me.

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,000
I've gone lame!

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,880
That shouldn't have happened.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I followed this manual exactly.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,200
Doesn't it say right here that one
should jump from a height of three zhang?

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Lu Buping.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Look closely.

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,200
You're holding the book upside down, no?

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
My goodness.

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,000
It's all right.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,120
It's fine. Let's get back to business.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,840
Lu Buping,
I have an important secret to tell you.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,840
Now is the time
you should know about it.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,000
What secret?

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,920
Yue Qianxue
is your real biological sister.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,440
As for Lu Qianqian...

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
She's a fake.

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,840
You're my sister?

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,040
Mhm.

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,080
That's right.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Yue Yong?

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Greeting, Your Highness.
My name is Hongyue.

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,560
You...

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,440
I remember now.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
You're that traitorous Hongyue.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,720
You're the one who knocked me out
the other day, right?

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,040
I...

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,400
She's not a traitor.

49
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,160
She was framed!

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,600
Why should I believe you?

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,920
This is way too much.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,840
Now you're telling me
my mother isn't really my mother

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,280
and my sister isn't my sister.

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,920
And now Hongyue is here too.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,380
How do you expect me to believe you?

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
If you truly want to know,

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
do a blood test.

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,600
If the drops merge, you're related.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
Blood test?

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,940
Wait...

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
They merged!

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,840
Oh my!

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,240
My poor sister!

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,760
Come here, let me give you a hug.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,680
How dare you, Yue Qianxue!

66
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,160
How could you slap your brother
the moment you met him?

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Do you know how much emotional trauma

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,240
that slap caused me?

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,080
Stop messing around, Yue.

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,760
Let's get down to business.

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
Buping.

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,240
You'd better get up now.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
Do I really have to help you up myself?

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,400
No...

75
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
I'm getting up...

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
I'm up.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
Now, what we need to do next

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,560
is this...

79
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,260
(City Lord's Manor)

80
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Speak.

81
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,920
How's the investigation
of Lu Li's treason

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,120
coming along?

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,760
There are less than twelve hours left.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,800
Lu Li is indeed
not a traitor, Your Majesty.

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,240
What do you mean?

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Because Lu Li was never
from Changping Capital to begin with.

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
From the very start,

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,000
he was a spy sent by Ximu.

89
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,840
A spy?

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,280
Eighteen years ago,

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,120
in the 45th year of the Mingdu era,

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,160
he came to Changping Capital
with an important figure,

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,510
and he has been hiding ever since.

94
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
His goal

95
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
was to destroy our national fate

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
and bring chaos to our land.

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,520
Who exactly are you talking about?

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Her Highness.

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
You mean

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,640
my wife?

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,040
Father.

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Well...

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,480
Well...

104
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,480
After the recent investigation,

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,040
the whole incident
has proved to be peculiar.

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,600
However...

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
However...

108
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Spit it out!

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,040
Finish your sentence.

110
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,800
Yue Qianxue and I have had a blood test.

111
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,720
She's certainly my biological sister.

112
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,400
Nonsense! You're outrageous than ever!

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,440
You're the Crown Prince, Ping.

114
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,240
How could you do a blood test
just like that?

115
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,320
What are you doing?

116
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
For the sake of the truth,
please bear with it, Father.

117
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,080
Let go of me!

118
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,360
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,040
Let go of me. What are you doing?

120
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,600
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,640
You will regret this.

122
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Guards!

123
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,360
Why aren't they merged?

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
How dare you!

125
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,000
Let go of His Majesty now!

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,160
Let go of me!

127
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,800
Hongyue?

128
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Yao Wei.

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
You may leave.

131
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
Your Majesty...

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,400
Leave.

133
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
Are you...

134
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
Hongyue?

135
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I'm the Left Guard Commander, Hongyue.

136
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Hongyue.

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
I've been looking
for you all these years.

138
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,680
You, come with me.

139
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,480
How come I have two fathers?

140
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Weichen?

141
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
Father.

142
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,080
Father.

143
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,080
Ping.

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,600
Ping.

145
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,640
You're all grown-up.

146
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Ping.

147
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Ping.

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,760
Father.

149
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,000
Well... That man has been
impersonating you all this time.

150
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
And I had no idea about that.

151
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Why...

152
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Why did you keep all this from me?

153
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,240
I've tried to locate you
all these years.

154
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
Why?

155
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,840
Why did I fail to do so?

156
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,960
I was looking for you too.

157
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,720
Word came from Changping Capital

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,720
said you attacked Her Highness

159
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,600
and disappeared ever since.

160
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,520
I didn't believe it.

161
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,160
Later on...

162
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
Well,

163
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,520
I then left the Tianji Pavilion

164
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
and went searching for you.

165
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,980
I searched everywhere
but couldn't find you.

166
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,800
In the first year of Tianyuan,

167
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,440
I ended up in Luori City

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,920
and disguised as a fortune teller

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,960
just to get news about you.

170
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,640
Thank you so much, sir!

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
(Tianyan Divine Seer)
Your predictions are spot on!

172
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,440
You're too kind, old man.

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
Have you ever heard of

174
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,680
a young lady named Hongyue?

175
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,320
Uh...

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,760
No, not at all.

177
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
Sorry about that, sir.

178
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,080
Apologies.

179
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,440
Hey,

180
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
did you hear?

181
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
That Tianyan Divine Seer guy

182
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,360
is scarily accurate.

183
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,720
He said

184
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,000
there'd be rain tomorrow at noon

185
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,840
with three inches of it inside the city
and four outside.

186
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,080
How precise.

187
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,080
So, do you want to go test him out?

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,450
Come on, if he were really that good,

189
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,240
would he still need
to ask everyone he meets

190
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,440
if they know a girl named Hongyue?

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
Shouldn't he just divine it?

192
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,640
Why ask around?

193
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,640
At the time,
I was on a secret inspection.

194
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,080
I saw Weichen asking everywhere
about Hongyue.

195
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,960
So I...

196
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,040
I had him quietly
brought back to the manor.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,760
I wanted to ask him...

198
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,680
about your mother's assassination.

199
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
Because...

200
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,960
Because...

201
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,640
Because I felt that

202
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,560
ever since she was attacked
and Hongyue's disappearance,

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
she

204
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
has been acting strangely.

205
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,760
Report!

206
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
Your Majesty.

207
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,640
The city garrison spotted Her Highness
fifteen li outside the city.

208
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,590
She has been escorted
back to Changping Capital.

209
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,720
They found her?

210
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,800
Is she alright?

211
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,520
She has some scrapes,

212
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,400
but nothing serious.

213
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,440
Quick, take me to her!

214
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
Honey.

215
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,200
I personally made
this millet porridge for you.

216
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Honey.

217
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
Give it a taste.

218
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,880
How thoughtful of you, Your Majesty.

219
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,200
Honey.

220
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Why do we sound
so formal all of a sudden?

221
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Here.

222
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,960
Your Majesty.

223
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
Well...

224
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,600
This is a holy relic I obtained
during my prayers.

225
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,440
As long as it's placed
on the manor's dragon vein,

226
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
it can bring prosperity
to Changping Capital

227
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
and peace to the people.

228
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,720
Honey.

229
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,000
When no one else is around,

230
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,320
you always call me

231
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,280
"Dear" or "My love."

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
Why do you sound so distant today?

233
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,000
You keep calling me "Your Majesty."

234
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
Why? Are you still mad at me

235
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,960
for not going to Mount Wanfu
with you for the prayers?

236
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,480
Well, it's not that case.

237
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,200
I...

238
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,760
I was just caught off guard

239
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,280
by Hongyue's attack.

240
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,760
Calling you "Your Majesty"

241
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,040
has simply made me feel safer.

242
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,360
That Hongyue is unbelievable.

243
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,400
I wonder which country bribed her.

244
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,480
How dare she commit
such a treasonous act!

245
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,640
If it weren't for that chivalrous man
who came to my rescue,

246
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,000
I wouldn't have made it out alive.

247
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,600
Who are you talking about?

248
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Lu Li.

249
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
My name is Lu Li. Greetings, Your Majesty

250
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,160
and Your Highness.
