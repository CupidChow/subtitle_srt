13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Inside there.

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
It's Her Highness.

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Her Highness?

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,920
She's dead.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,240
Dead?

18
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,700
(Changping Capital)

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,960
Lu Qianqian?

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
Ah, that's not it.

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,960
Her Highness.

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
How should I address you?

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
It doesn't matter.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
Why are you in such a rush?

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
Where are you even going?

26
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,520
What... What are you talking about?

27
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I don't get it.

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,160
Buping!

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey,

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Buping!

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,520
That's the one, Buping!

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,480
That woman

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
kidnapped me!

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,280
And now they've joined hands

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,080
to usurp the throne! Please save me!

36
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,800
Who... Who exactly are you?

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,800
Are you really my sister?

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm Qianqian,

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
Buping!

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,520
Look at me, I'm Qianqian!

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,680
Do you think we might've got it wrong?

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
That the one who died
was actually the fake mother?

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
She...

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
She looks exactly like my sister.

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,000
Even if she's fake,

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,600
that makes her a victim too, no?

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,640
Buping.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
Seriously,
I know nothing about all this.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm a victim too!

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,320
She's not Qianqian!

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,560
Father.

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm well aware of
that red mole on her chest.

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Back then,
after the attack on Her Highness,

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
a red mole
mysteriously appeared on her chest.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,160
I even asked her about it myself.

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Honey.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Do you still remember that?

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Do you believe it now?

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,040
You were the one who killed me
before I was reborn.

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Yes.

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,920
I was the one who killed you

62
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,680
before you were reborn.

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,320
But I never expected
to return with my memories

64
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,560
and still fail to get rid of you.

65
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
Brilliant!

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
Let's put her head on the city wall
and trade for food!

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
That way, we can survive!

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,680
We'll survive!

69
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
We'll finally have food again!

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
How did you know Yue Qianxue
was the true Princess?

71
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,320
Before I set out,

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
we bathed together.

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,120
I saw the birthmark on her back.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,560
To my surprise,
after waiting over twenty years,

75
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
she'd walk right into my hands.

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,440
Then why did you change your face
to Lu Qianqian's?

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Why?

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
If I didn't wear her face,

79
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,720
how else could I make the Barbarian King
fall for me and let me enter Luori City?

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
Changping Capital's dragon vein
lies beneath Luori City.

81
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Today marks the downfall
of Changping Capital.

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,640
Don't worry.

83
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
Master said,

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
as long as you finish the task,

85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,040
he'll end your life.

86
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,720
Lu Li…

87
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,640
Why?

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,480
Master said you're filthy.

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,760
I never thought when I opened my eyes,

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,960
I'd returned
to the sixth year of Tianyuan.

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Since I knew how I'd end,

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
I decided to save myself.

93
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,200
First, I had the man in black frame you.

94
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
I wanted him to target Lu Li.

95
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,080
But who knew Hua Qingming
would end up catching him?

96
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,040
Quick, take me hostage.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,520
That way, you can escape!

98
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,160
Hurry!

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,040
Quickly!

100
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
Guards!

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,960
Help me!

102
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Hurry!

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Guards, please!

104
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Help me!

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,880
I then arranged for Lu Li to kidnap you.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,520
I wanted to use Hua Qingming
to get rid of him too.

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Who would've thought?

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
Lu Li was out of the picture.

109
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,640
But unexpectedly,

110
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,920
it got harder and harder
to complete my mission.

111
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Later, I realized

112
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
you

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
were reborn too.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Since your goal
was to destroy Changping Capital,

115
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,600
why did you ask me to save His Majesty

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,110
when the man in black
tried to poison him?

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
Why not just let him die, then?

118
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,920
It's been over 20 years.

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,600
Even if it was
all for a ridiculous mission,

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,200
how could I
not develop feelings for him?

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,520
Well, forget it.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,160
It's all over anyway.

123
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,720
Your Majesty.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,680
My love.

125
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,520
Tell me.

126
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,400
If I died,

127
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
would you miss me?

128
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,360
Did you ever feel anything for me?

129
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,440
Even just the tiniest bit?

130
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,680
The one I love

131
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
has always been my wife.

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,640
My true wife.

133
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,480
It's not that face you're wearing now!

134
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,700
Your Majesty!

135
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,680
- Father!
- Your Majesty!

136
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Ping.

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,880
You must grow up now.

138
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,520
From now on…

139
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,080
From now on,

140
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,800
Changping Capital

141
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,880
is in your hands.

142
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,200
Honey...

143
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,600
Honey...

144
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,080
Honey...

145
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Your Majesty!

146
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,080
Father!

147
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,220
- Your Majesty!
- Father!

148
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,780
Your Majesty!

149
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,400
Father!

150
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,980
(Ten years later)

151
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Your Majesty.

152
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,960
Speak.

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,040
The Weiyuan Army has dealt a crushing blow
to the barbarians in the North.

154
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
Their leader has been captured.

155
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,280
Ximu has officially submitted
to Changping Capital!

156
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Excellent.

157
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,320
If there's nothing else, you may go.

158
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
There's one more thing.

159
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
The city garrison reports
that two people have arrived.

160
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,440
They seem to be Lord Zhenbei
and Ms. Yue Qianxue.

161
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
What did you say?

162
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,840
Lord Zhenbei and Ms. Yue?

163
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,440
Where? Take me to them now!

164
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,840
They're finally back

165
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,200
after all these years!

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,040
Qingming.

167
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,400
Changping Capital's Mid-Autumn Festival
is as lively as ever.

168
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,340
Our ten years of wandering
passed in the blink of an eye.

169
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,110
Who'd have thought

170
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,360
Lu Buping actually managed
to govern Changping Capital this well?

171
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,280
Look. Don't these lanterns look
just like what we had back then?

172
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
And you're just as beautiful as before.

173
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,360
Come on!

174
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
Slow down!

175
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,560
Hey!

176
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,600
Careful!

181

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,720
Sorry about that.

183
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,700
That was reckless of her.

184
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,400
But she definitely meant no harm.

185
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm sorry for scaring you two.
Here, these are for you.

186
