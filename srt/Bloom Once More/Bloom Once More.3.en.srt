I knew you could do it.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,320
You really did cure my father's ailment.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,680
Yue Qianxue, not bad at all.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,360
Why don't you stick with me from now on?

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,680
Yue, come on.

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,920
Let's go home.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,560
I actually think
His Highness makes a fair point.

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,960
Lord Zhenbei, take a look.

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,840
It's not that I won't let her go.

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
She doesn't want to leave.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,840
Yue...

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,440
You've made enough of a scene today.

Come.

00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,520
Hey!

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,080
Fine, fly off!

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
All you lot do is fly!

Speak.

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Why travel so far to Changping Capital

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,160
just to frame Yue Qianxue?

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,240
Do you really think I'd tell you?

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
Your Majesty.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,200
General Ye, you've done well.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,480
Let me handle the interrogation myself.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,520
Help!

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,480
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,280
Are you all right?

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm fine.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
The moment you stepped out,

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,280
he broke free of his restraints

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,400
and attacked me.

Wake up!

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,600
Ms. Yue, wake up!

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
Today is your birthday.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560

Chan, where's my Yueying?

Yueying?

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,440
I saw Lord Zhenbei
sneaking around this morning.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
He swapped Yueying with Huaxuan.

His Lordship says no one is to enter.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,120
Move aside.

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,920
Lord Zhenbei, Ms. Yue just...

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Qi, leave us.

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Yes.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,080
Where is Yueying?

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Yue.

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
I know today is your birthday.

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
I embroidered a piece
called "Blooming in Moonlight".

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not very good at it.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,960
Here you go.

81
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,880
I hope you don't mind.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,280
I don't want some embroidered gown.

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,600
I just want my sword.

Ms. Yue has acted like
a different person ever since her return

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,640
from the Tianji Pavilion.

91
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880
Did something happen to her?

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Qi.

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Get ready.

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
We're going to the Tianji Pavilion.

95
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,220
(Tianji Pavilion)

96
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Master, the Donghuang Bell has rung.

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Master.

98
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720
The bell...

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,280
Master, your hair!

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
When the Donghuang rings,
a past life ends.

101
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Yue Qianxue...

102
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,880
You really did come back.

103
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
Master.

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,200
It's only been twelve hours
since Ms. Yue left.

105
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,520
What do you mean she's already returned?

106
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,400
(How exactly did I come back
to the sixth year of Tianyuan?)

107
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,000
(Did Hua Qingming
really try to kill me?)

108
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,920
Ms. Yue!

109
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,600
You're back.

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
Oh, right.

111
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,800
I noticed the string
on this bell broke,

112
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,400
so I re-threaded it for you.

113
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,960
This is called the Donghuang Chime.

114
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,280
It was forged from
fragments of the Donghuang Bell.

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,410
Master, you're giving this to me?

116
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,240
But why?

117
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,720
This is way too precious.

118
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,240
Ms. Yue,

119
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,240
one day you'll use the Donghuang Chime.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,000
When that day comes, you'll understand.

121
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,480
Master, I can come back anytime.

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,760
I don't need some bell for that.

123
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
Why bother with the Donghuang Chime?

124
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,840
Everything is bound by fate.

125
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,880
Chan, come with me
to the Tianji Pavilion.

126
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Alright.

127
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,060
(Tianji Pavilion)

128
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
Hongyi.

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,800
Yes, Master.

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,640
Go meet General Yue.

131
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,600
General Yue?

132
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,520
Who's General Yue?

133
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
Yue Qianxue,
from Lord Zhenbei's Mansion.

134
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,160
When did Ms. Yue become a general?

135
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
Stop asking.

136
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,560
Understood.

137
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,120
You've been through
a lot these years, General Yue.

138
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Master, how did you know
I'm General Yue?

139
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,320
If I didn't know,

140
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,600
you wouldn't have come to me today.

141
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,520
When the Donghuang Bell rings,
the past life ends.

142
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
Do you remember

143
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,960
when you were studying
at Tianji Pavilion in your last life?

144
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,000
The Donghuang Bell rang once then.

145
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,680
I, Yue Qianxue, greet Master Zhuge.

146
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,200
The Donghuang Bell
was born of the heavens,

147
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,280
shaping all things,
silent for a thousand years.

148
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,440
When it rings,
it means a cycle begins again.

149
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,120
A cycle?

150
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
You were chosen
by the Donghuang Bell, General Yue.

151
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,480
Your fate is tied to the lives
of everyone in this world.

152
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,520
Me?

153
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,440
General Yue,

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,380
you've been given a second chance.

155
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,600
Don't let hatred cloud your mind.

156
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,160
The weight you carry
is to save all of humanity.

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Now I understand what you meant

158
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,680
by me coming back.

159
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,720
But what does my death
link to the fate of the world?

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
What happens in this life

161
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,040
is beyond my full understanding.

162
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
You'll have to find
the answer yourself, General Yue.

163
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,640
But I believe one day
you'll understand everything.

164
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,640
My Lord.

165
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,080
What did Master Zhuge say to you?

166
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,040
This whole time,

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
you've looked so down.

168
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,480
(Three months ago,)

169
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,600
(when Ms. Yue came
to Tianji Pavilion to study,)

170
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
(I observed the stars at night.)

171
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,560
(I saw the fall of the Tianshu Star,)

172
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,800
(and the Donghuang Bell
stirred with it.)

173
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,800
A great catastrophe is
bound to strike this world.

174
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,520
And Ms. Yue happens
to be the key to it all.

175
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,480
Master,

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,800
is there any way
to stop all this from happening?

177
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,840
Keep the Donghuang Chime close.

178
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,920
You'll understand everything in time.

179
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey!

180
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
Isn't that Qingming's carriage?

181
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,800
Qingming!

182
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,920
Move aside!

183
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,280
Qingming!

184
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,480
Where are you going?

185
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,880
Qingming!

186
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
Come on, hurry!

187
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,840
Come here!

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,400
I heard someone say
there's a snake charmer up ahead.

189
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,280
It's super fun!

190
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Come watch with me!

191
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,280
Come on, this way!

192
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,320
Qingming!

193
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,240
Come here!

194
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,960
Come on, just here, just here!

195
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,920
Look, look!

196
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Isn't it cool?

197
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,640
Hahaha!

198
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Look, look!

199
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:54,920
The snake is coming out!

200
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,360
It's coming out, look!

201
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,240
Hey.

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,800
Where is my snake?

203
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
It was just here a moment ago.

204
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,320
This is no fun.

205
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,000
The fool is clumsy enough

206
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,840
to lose the snake.

207
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
Qingming, come on.

208
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,160
Ah!

209
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,120
Qingming!

210
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
It's on your hand!

211
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,280
Qingming!

212
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Miss.

213
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,260
Yue.

214
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,120
Now this is a real misunderstanding.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,720
Why do I keep running into her?

216
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,160
This is annoying.

217
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,200
Stop following me, seriously.

218
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,920
Yue!

219
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,360
Yue!

220
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,040
(This is Yue's shoe.)

221
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,880
Yue Qianxue!

222
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,840
Yue Qianxue!

223
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,440
Yue Qianxue!

224
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,680
Oh no, the snake venom is taking effect.
