Yue!

Yue!

15
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,350
You're awake.

16
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,310
Don't get up! Don't move.

17
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,870
Donkey-hide gelatin, red dates, and black
chicken soup simmered for four hours.

18
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,430
You've lost too much blood.

19
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,590
You need to rest for a while.

20
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,390
I told you not to move.

21
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,110
You're disobedient.

22
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,670
Here.

23
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,150
I can't let

24
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,070
a woman feed me.

25
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,470
I'll do it myself.

26
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,070
Behave.

27
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,070
I forgot it was still hot.

28
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,670
Are you all right?

29
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,470
Was it so hot that it got you teary?

30
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,310
I'm glad it's hot.

31
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,710
The burn

32
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,030
gives me pain.

33
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,990
The pain lets me know
this isn't a dream.

34
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,990
It tells me

35
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,990
you really did come back alive.

36
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,430
I dreamed
of this moment countless nights.

37
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,350
Countless nights full of regret.

38
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,790
And now

39
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,350
it has actually come true.

40
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,910
Since Heaven has given us
a second chance,

41
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,750
we must uncover the truth
behind the war against the barbarians

42
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,310
so we can stop this senseless bloodshed.

43
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,550
Once everything is over,

44
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,630
I want to be with you forever.

45
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,950
Somewhere peaceful

46
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,470
and untouched by the world.

47
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,990
All right?

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,270
All right.

49
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,150
I promise you.

50
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,310
But first we need to find out

51
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,910
why Lu Li turned traitor.

52
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,150
And Lu Qianqian…

53
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,270
What about Lu Qianqian?

54
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,070
You two got cozy fast.

55
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,070
Lass,

56
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,910
have you forgotten
how this guy treated you just days ago?

57
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,950
Cut it out. Just get to the point.

58
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,710
Why are you here?

59
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,220
Hurry. His Majesty has just recovered
from his illness.

60
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,340
Bring clean clothes
and wait outside the bath chamber.

61
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,070
His Majesty is summoning Lord Zhenbei
and Yue Qianxue shortly.

62
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,390
Lu Li's body has already been brought
to the mortuary.

63
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,590
I just came to let you know.

64
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,030
I'll go investigate,
see if there are any new leads.

65
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,190
Wait.

66
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,550
I'll go with you.

67
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,350
I don't think so.

68
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,270
Your Highness,

69
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,350
what do you mean?

70
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,030
My father

71
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,270
has recovered.

72
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,390
He asked me

73
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,070
to personally invite Yue Qianxue.

74
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,150
He says she is to be rewarded

75
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,150
for saving his life.

76
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,990
And you too, Lord Zhenbei.

77
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,990
You're

78
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,430
Yue Qianxue's guardian,

79
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,870
so you need to go as well.

80
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,350
Then I won't delay.

81
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,190
I'll go on ahead.

82
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,270
Hold on.

83
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,350
I hate it when my father praises others
right in front of me.

84
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,110
It's suffocating.

85
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,550
I'll go

86
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,550
with you to investigate this case.

87
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,350
You?

88
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,270
Uh-huh.

89
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,230
What's the meaning of this?

90
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,070
You lot are always flying around

91
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,270
like you've got wings.

92
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,990
If I don't tie you down,
you'll leave me behind.

93
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,670
Both of you get cleaned up
and head to the City Lord's Manor.

94
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,350
Don't keep my father waiting,

95
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,550
you hear?

96
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,740
Let's go.

97
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,780
(City Lord's Manor)

98
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
Ms. Yue.

99
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,030
If not
for your remarkable medical skills,

100
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,350
I might have died in bed.

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,110
I am unworthy of such high praise.

102
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,070
If Her Majesty had not trusted me,

103
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,790
Your Majesty's treatment
would have been delayed.

104
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,510
Then you certainly deserve

105
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,590
a share of today's reward.

106
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,950
I always thought Ms. Yue was clever,

107
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,230
so I agreed to let her treat you.

108
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,630
I hope you will not blame me
for that decision.

109
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,510
Why would I blame you?

110
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,190
If you did the right thing,

111
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,030
then it is right.

112
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,150
There is no fault in that.

113
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,390
However,

114
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,990
with reward

115
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,710
also comes

116
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,630
punishment.

117
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,430
That day,

118
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,510
you two were on duty at the door

119
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,070
to my bedchamber.

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,430
All right.

122
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,350
Tell me.

123
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,670
Should you

124
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,350
be punished or not?

125
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,310
- Mercy, Your Majesty.
- Mercy, Your Majesty.

126
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,470
Get up.

127
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,390
Get up!

128
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,710
Look how scared you are.

129
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,430
Am I really that frightening?

130
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,150
Still,

131
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,910
punishment

132
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,830
must be dealt.

133
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,830
Right.

134
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,150
I heard our Qianqian
has admired Lord Zhenbei for years,

135
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,990
and she loves to be
involved in everything.

136
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,030
Let her take charge of arranging
the rewards.

137
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,470
What's the matter, Lu Buping?

138
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,350
It's "Your Highness" to you.

139
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,670
Let me get ready.

140
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,310
Here. I'll give you one.

141
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,350
I don't need it.

142
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,670
You…

143
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,070
(Suppressing Talisman)
I was being kind! You ingrate!

144
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,230
You're such a coward.

145
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,730
Why did you insist on coming with me?

146
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,670
Nonsense!

147
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,630
Coward?

148
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,470
I'm not afraid of anyone!

149
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,950
Oh, goodness!

150
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,550
Oh, woe is me!

151
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,270
Spare me!

152
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,150
I'm going to be
the ruler of this city one day!

153
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,310
Tch.

154
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,870
And here I thought
it was something serious.

155
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,390
Qian is missing?

156
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,710
We… We haven't seen Her Highness
the past few days.

157
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,870
Past few days?

158
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,430
Ever…

159
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,160
Ever since the last time Her Highness
watched the snake performance

160
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,990
with Lord Zhenbei, she hasn't been seen.

161
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,830
Your Majesty.

162
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,270
Father,

163
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,230
I've made an important discovery.

164
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,230
Let's hear it.

165
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,550
Ping.

166
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,150
Take a look. Is this the symbol?

167
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,270
Yes.

168
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,510
Dear,

169
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,230
how did you find out about this?

170
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,910
I…

171
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,550
Just say it.

172
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,030
That day, the black-clad assassin
who tried to kill His Majesty

173
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,270
had this tattoo on his neck.

174
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,070
And the assassin had
a Ximu token on him.

175
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,470
Lord Zhenbei.

176
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,070
Lu Li was your deputy.

177
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,310
How do you explain this?

178
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,030
Your Majesty.

179
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,350
I do not know.

180
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,110
"You don't know"?

181
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,910
Lord Zhenbei.

182
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,910
Do you think that is enough

183
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,910
to brush this aside?

184
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,790
Is that acceptable?

185
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,510
It appears that today's reward
will be rescinded.

186
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,670
As for punishment…

187
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,950
Ye Weiming.

188
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,710
