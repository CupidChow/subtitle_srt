84
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,760
is not going to Luori City

people like that.

109
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,320
His Highness wet himself!

110
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't worry, Your Highness.

111
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,400
I already surrounded you

112
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960

127
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,040
has reincarnated from the great disaster
two years from now.

128
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,160
Reincarnation?

129
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,600
No wonder

130
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,840
she has been saying
so many strange things lately.

131
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
That means

132
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,800
she died in the eighth year of Tianyuan.

133
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,560
Young Lady,

134
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
the medicinal bath is ready.

135
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
- I...
- You...

136
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,080
You go first.

137
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,600
You came back too.

138
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
In the eighth year of Tianyuan,

139
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,200
I never once thought
of giving up on you,

140
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,280
let alone

141
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,280
giving up Luori City.

142
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
It really is you.

143
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,840
But...

144
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,040
Lu Qianqian came to me
with your Yueying,

145
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,640
saying you wanted
to cut off my supplies.

146
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,200
She even claimed you had ordered her
to use Yueying to claim my head.

147
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,800
Yue.

148
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,720
Will you believe me?

149
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
Yes.

150
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,360
In the eighth year of Tianyuan,

151
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,920
I was fighting the barbarians
in the northwest.

152
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,840
We never expected Ximu
to form an alliance with them

153
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
to invade us.

154
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,990
The northwest
was in a state of emergency.

155
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,760
I had no way of pulling back
to support Luori City.

156
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
So I mobilized all the supplies

157
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,760
and entrusted Yueying to Lu Qianqian.

158
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,200
I ordered her and Lu Li
to go ahead and support the city.

159
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,480
But...

160
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,720
But in the end,

161
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,160
they brought back news
of your death in battle.

162
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,440
Yue.

163
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,280
I... I missed you so much.

164
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
In my last life,

165
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,120
the one thing I never told you

166
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,240
was that I've loved you

167
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,520
