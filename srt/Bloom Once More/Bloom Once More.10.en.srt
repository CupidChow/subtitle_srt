13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,680
We can't just

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,320
start raising pigs as a family now.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
How about I tell you something

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,520
about the Three Thousand Ways?

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,840
The Three Thousand Ways?

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,920
That's right.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,280
Lately, I've been really into

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,440
studying the Book of Changes
and how all things in the world

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,800
are connected in a cycle.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,040
Well,

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,600
the pig feed formulas

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,760
are just something I read
for fun on the side.

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Then go on, let's hear it.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,120
Well...

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,400
Well...

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,760
You see,

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,400
I've come to a remarkable conclusion

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
about the cause and effect
behind everything in existence.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,640
A remarkable conclusion?

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,840
One that no living creature can escape,

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,880
no matter who or what you are.

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,720
Go on, tell me.

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,040
After all my research, I discovered

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,120
that everything in the world

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,160
will

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,800
eventually

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
live till it dies.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,320
Ping, my boy.

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,280
You really don't have to
study that hard.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
Your health matters most.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Get back to your chambers
and rest soon.

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
I'll return to my chambers.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,640
Mother,

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,920
be careful on your way back!

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Coast is clear.

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,520
You can come down now.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,960
Lu Buping.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,160
Tell us where you got this talisman.

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,120
I got it from...

52
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
I got it from...

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,120
Oh!

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,440
I went to greet my father

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,640
in his chambers, but he wasn't there.

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,080
And the floor tiles were broken,

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,560
so I tripped hard.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,840
When I looked under the bed,
I found a pile of talismans.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
I figured, if Father was hiding them,

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,640
they must be something good.

61
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,560
So I took a few with me.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
My guess is right.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,600
That wasn't the real
Her Majesty just now.

64
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,220
What?That wasn't my mother?

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,600
That wasn't my mother?

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,840
Then, who was it?

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
My father?

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,160
My mother is my father?

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,880
Does that mean my father

70
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,280
is my grandfather?

71
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,040
Lu Buping.

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Did you fall on your head
when you were a kid?

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
Quite a few times, actually.

74
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,600
What I meant was,

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,080
the City Lord disguised himself
as Her Majesty

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,840
and came to the storage pavilion
looking for something.

77
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,360
He just happened to
run into you and got interrupted.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
That was why

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
he left in such a hurry.

80
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,800
How can you be so sure it was my father?

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,360
Back when Her Majesty went
to Wanfusi Temple to pray,

82
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,520
she was ambushed by the spy Hongyue.

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
Her left hand was badly injured.

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
She still can't
move it properly to this day.

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,080
But just now,

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
she took the booklet from your hand,

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
she used her left hand.

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,720
And I remember
the City Lord is left-handed.

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,280
Right, I thought something was off too

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,880
when Mother grabbed that book.

91
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,880
Right.

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,840
Lu Buping.

93
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
Take a look

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,520
at the talisman you snuck out
from the City Lord's Manor.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,840
These characters...

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
Can you tell?

97
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
The handwriting is awful.

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,160
The characters at the bottom.

99
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,840
It's

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,920
"Suppressing Talisman."

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
I thought

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,920
the City Lord already
knew about the Earth Seal Scroll.

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
But for some reason,

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,080
he tried to seal it away with talismans.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,160
As for why he came
to the storage pavilion,

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
I believe it was to...

107
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
To search for
the sealed Earth Seal Scroll.

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
Wait, hold on.

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,040
This is giving me a headache.

110
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,000
Why would my father
disguise himself as my mother?

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
If he wanted the Earth Seal Scroll,

112
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,720
couldn't he just send me away
with any excuse?

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
Why bother leaving on his own?

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
That I can't say for sure.

115
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
But since he left,

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,920
he must've had his reasons.

117
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,480
It's about the timing.

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,440
When the City Lord disguised
as Her Majesty came in,

119
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
he seemed to be chatting
with His Highness,

120
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,120
but his eyes
kept watching that direction.

121
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
He was likely using
the moonlight to track the time.

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,520
Maybe he realized
you were stalling him for too long,

123
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,470
and he couldn't trigger
whatever mechanism it was.

124
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,960
So, he turned around and left.

125
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Time?

126
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,560
Time?

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
If I remember correctly,

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,960
when Her Majesty came in just now,

129
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,200
that light beam landed
right on this luminous pearl.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,480
What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
Isn't it just a hole in the ceiling?

132
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
This storage pavilion

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,520
holds important records
of Changping Capital.

134
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,520
If it were just a normal hole,

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,280
they would've patched it right away.

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,720
If the City Lord has left it untouched,

137
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,240
then it must serve a purpose.

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm not giving up that easily.

139
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Lu Buping,

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,280
stop wasting your strength.

141
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
This mechanism

142
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,920
is likely a machine
from the Western Regions.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,990
It's called a tidal lock.

144
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,800
Tidal lock?

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
I've only heard bits about it.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
It has an internal balancing device

147
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,280
that aligns with the movement
of the moon in the sky.

148
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,200
It can only be moved
and opened at a certain time of day.

149
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,800
Any other time,

150
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,840
no matter how hard you try
to break the mechanism, it won't open.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
Oh my.

152
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,520
My father really knows how to mess
with foreign gadgets.

153
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
So,

154
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,880
what do we do next?

155
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,960
We come back tomorrow night.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
You wretched woman!
I hope you die the worst death!

157
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,800
I'll have my father feed you
to the wolves on Mount Zhubi!

158
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
Your Highness.

159
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,680
Do you really think

160
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
I don't know who you are?

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Since you're so confident
in your identity,

162
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,680
how about I add
one more detail for you?

163
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,480
Just like you wanted.

164
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Now you look even more like her.

165
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
(Dongbi Academy)

166
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,840
Wake up! Wake up!

167
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,920
- Sir, I'm sorry!
- Unbelievable!

168
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
And you too!

169
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,560
You two brats had the nerve
to fall asleep right under my nose?

170
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
Falling asleep, huh?

171
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,080
I'll teach you a lesson!

172
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
Sir, I'm so sorry!

173
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,320
Stop right there!

174
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,640
You missed again!

175
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
And you too!

176
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,240
(Wait a minute. When did I
ever study at Dongbi Academy?)

177
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,640
Qingming!

178
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,080
Qingming!

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Qingming!

180
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,400
Qingming!

181
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Qingming!

182
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,920
Qingming!

183
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Qingming!

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,200
Yue.

185
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,560
Look.

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,000
It's snowing.

187
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Yue.

188
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
Hua Qingming, you jerk!

189
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,280
I was so worried!

190
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,800
Yue,

191
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,960
what's wrong?

192
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,760
How did I worry you?

193
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
I couldn't sleep,
so I went out for a walk.

194
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,160
I didn't expect it to start snowing.

195
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,000
It's just like the snowfall
when I first met you.

196
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,360
Look.

197
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
