13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,520
He talked so sweetly.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,040
And then vanished without a trace
in the blink of an eye.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,560
That wretched man!

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Liar!

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,200
They are all liars!

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,520
Maybe Weichen did not lie to you.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,540
Maybe he has been looking for you
all this time,

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,080
Hongyue.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,960
What did you just call me?

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Hongyue.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
The traitorous general
from 18 years ago.

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Hongyue.

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,160
Let me go!

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,120
Don't move. Resistance is futile.

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,990
You might as well be good
and let me enjoy you.

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,480
You fat pig!

29
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,040
Bald donkey!

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
Do you even know who I am?

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,500
When I get out of here, I'll have my father
cut you into pieces and feed you to the dogs!

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
You hit me?

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Behave yourself!

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
Let go of me!

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
You're a feisty one.

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
I like that.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Once the aphrodisiac kicks in,

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm going to enjoy
every last inch of you.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,200
Sir!

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
What's wrong?

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,840
You're so rough.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,960
You're hurting me.

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
You're terrible.

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,240
Changed your mind?

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,840
Mm.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,920
Good.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,680
If you've changed your mind,
then this is mutual.

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,960
That way,
you won't be the only one suffering.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,840
Come here.

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,040
Sir.

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
What now?

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
My legs are still tied.

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,120
How are we supposed
to have fun like this?

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,120
I see.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
Hang on. I'll fix it right now.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,320
I'm getting impatient.

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,590
I can't wait a moment longer.

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,320
Hurry up!

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Untie it faster!

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Come…

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,520
Bald donkey!

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Fat pig!

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,840
Lord Zhennan,
why would you say such a thing?

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,800
For over a decade,

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
my Fallen Blossom Lane has seen

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
thousands of warriors and heroes
come and go.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,840
Who doesn't know the name Yue Yong?

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
Hongyue?

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Afraid I've never heard of her.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,800
18 years ago,

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,360
Her Majesty had a personal bodyguard

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,040
named Hongyue.

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,800
That year,

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,680
coincidentally the year
the princess was born,

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,960
Her Majesty went to Mount Wanfu
to offer prayers.

76
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,920
Suddenly,

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,040
Hongyue ambushed Her Majesty
and the infant princess.

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Thanks to the heavens,

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,080
Her Majesty managed to escape
with the princess.

80
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,880
Hongyue failed
in her assassination attempt

81
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,520
and fled Changping Capital,
vanishing under a false name.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,360
Everyone in Changping Capital

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,840
knows about this.

84
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,840
So it was you, you shameless traitor,
who attacked my mother back then!

85
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
I…

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,840
Zhuge Renfeng once said

87
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,240
that shortly after your disappearance,

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,200
Weichen also vanished.

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,320
But before he disappeared,

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,640
he said he still had
worldly attachments,

91
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,120
and wandered off chasing after you.

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,400
I believe anyone
with true feelings for this world

93
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,200
would never betray the people they love.

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,440
So, Hongyue,

95
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,480
what exactly do you know?

96
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,200
Can you tell us?

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
It was the 45th year of Mingdu.

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
I was escorting Her Majesty
up the mountain to pray

99
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,760
when we were ambushed by assailants.

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
Her Majesty took an arrow to the leg.

101
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,000
In desperation,
she entrusted me with the princess

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,920
and with the hairpin

103
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
now on your head.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
I fled for a full day and night

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,960
before collapsing in a remote village.

106
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,880
Hongyue!

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
Hongyue!

108
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,200
Hongyue!

109
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,520
Hongyue!

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
Where are you, Hongyue?

111
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,320
Hongyue!

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Hongyue!

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,480
Hongyue!

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,040
Your Highness.

115
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,920
Your Highness.

116
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,040
Hongyue, you worried me!

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
Give Qianqian to me.

118
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Weren't you…

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
I was lucky just now

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,360
to escape the pursuers.

121
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,600
So I came straight to find you both.

122
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,040
Hand Qianqian over to me.

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
Hongyue.

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,640
Good work, Hongyue.

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
No.

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
You're not Her Highness.

127
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
Seize her!

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
Curses! She gave me a piece of wood!

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,040
Where's the real Lu Qianqian?

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,360
Master instructed you to bring the Earth
Seal Scroll into Changping Capital.

131
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,700
Everything else will come later.

132
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,760
After I fainted,

133
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,960
I remember nothing.

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,880
Fortunately,

135
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,680
I wasn't fatally wounded.

136
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,440
Once I recovered,

137
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,360
I discovered

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,280
I had become the most wanted criminal
in all of Changping Capital.

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,600
I had hidden the princess in a haystack,

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
but I was never able to find her again.

141
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
With no other option,

142
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,920
I changed my name to Yue Yong

143
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,160
and stayed hidden
in Fallen Blossom Lane.

144
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
Barely surviving,

145
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,760
while secretly gathering information.

146
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,880
One day, I swore,

147
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,120
I would uncover the truth behind it all.

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Miss.

149
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
The first time you came,

150
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I recognized the hairpin on your head.

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,640
That is the keepsake Her Majesty left
for the princess.

152
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,280
May I ask where you got it from?

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,040
Was the place where you were found
that day Qianchuan Ridge?

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
How do you know that?

155
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,640
I am Hua Qingming,

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
Lord Zhenbei of Changping Capital.

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,280
The true owner of this hairpin

158
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,760
is Yue.

159
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,120
This is the keepsake my mother
gave her life to leave for me.

160
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
Ms. Yue.

161
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,720
Do you have

162
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,240
a six-pointed star-shaped birthmark
on your back?

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,520
Is this the mark?

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,480
Left Guard Commander Hongyue
pays respects to Your Highness.

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,080
Aah!

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,000
Stay away!

167
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,680
Stay away from me!

168
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
You think you can run?

169
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,200
I was just planning
to have a little fun with you.

170
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,360
But you had to make it this difficult.

171
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,320
Don't blame me for what comes next.

172
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,960
Go ahead, run!

173
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,600
So it was you who kidnapped Lu Qianqian?

174
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
That's right.

175
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,360
All these years,

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
I have been trying to uncover the truth,

177
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
who the current Her Majesty really is,

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,040
and why that person
disguised themselves as Her Majesty.

179
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I was buying supplies
in Changping Capital

180
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,720
and happened to see Lu Qianqian alone
at a snake charmer's stall.

181
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,680
I seized the opportunity to abduct her.

182
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,000
After capturing her,

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,920
I confirmed

184
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,200
that the current Lu Qianqian
has no six-pointed star birthmark.

185
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,320
Which means the real princess

186
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,200
never fell into the hands of that fake.

187
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,680
And wouldn't you know it,

188
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,320
that very day, you all showed up
at Fallen Blossom Lane.

189
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,400
But since
you had already seen the hairpin

190
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,040
and suspected I was the princess
you once lost,

191
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,720
why would you send me
to steal the Earth Seal Scroll?

192
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,780
The Earth Seal Scroll appeared

193
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,640
in Changping Capital together
with that fake.

194
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
That mysterious person and the imposter

195
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,400
place so much importance on both
the scroll and the missing princess,

196
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,480
so I figured the two must be connected.

197
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,240
So I took a gamble and sent you
to steal the Earth Seal Scroll.

198
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
As for its true purpose,

199
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
I have no idea.

200
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
What should we do now?

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,600
I've already tattooed

202
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
a matching six-pointed star
on Lu Qianqian's back.

203
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,560
You rescue Lu Qianqian from Zhao Laosan,
and return to the capital to report in.

204
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,480
Once that fake
sees the tattoo on Lu Qianqian's back,

205
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,320
they will surely panic

206
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
and expose their secret.

207
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,840
Let's not tell Lu Buping

208
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
the full truth for now.

209
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,960
I've had my fun.

210
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,240
It's time for you to die.

211
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
No, please! Don't kill me!

212
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,400
Please…

213
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,480
Don't kill me…

214
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,680
Qianqian!

215
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
Are you all right, Qianqian?

216
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,400
Careful, Yue.

217
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
Are you all right?

218
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,440
He…

219
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,840
He assaulted…

220
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,760
He assaulted me…

221
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,240
You did what to my sister?

222
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,080
I'll make you pay!

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
You're going to pay for this!

224
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
Stop!

225
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,120
I'll kick you to death,
you disgusting lecher!

226
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,520
Stop!

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,270
How dare you lay a hand on her!

228
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,320
I'll beat you to a pulp!

229
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,120
How dare you!

230
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,400
You lecherous scum!

231
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,480
How dare you!

232
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,360
Let's return to the City Lord's Manor
and report in.

233
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,880
(City Lord's Manor)

234
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,680
Qian!

235
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,300
Qianqian!

236
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,280
Qian!

237
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,160
Qianqian!

238
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,120
Are you hurt?

239
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,240
What did they do to you?

240
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,240
Tell me.

241
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm here.

242
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,760
- Don't touch me…
- Qianqian…

243
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,840
