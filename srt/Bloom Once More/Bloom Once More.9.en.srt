=Episode 9=

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,740
(Dongbi Academy)

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Alright.

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,240
Let me walk you through it.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,440
See if the plan sounds right to you.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,960
So first,

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,320
we sneak into the outer perimeter
of the City Lord's Manor.

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,880
Then, we get inside
the City Lord's Manor itself

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,640
to look for something

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,600
called the Earth Seal Scroll.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,400
Finally,

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,760
I'll cover your escape
from the City Lord's Manor.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,800
Now here's the thing.

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,960
I have two questions.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
Go on.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,520
So,

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,480
first of all,

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Hua Qingming,
your martial arts are top-notch.

30
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,640
If you wanted to get into the manor,

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,240
you could just leap over
the wall in one go.

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,080
So what do you need me to cover you?

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm still recovering

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,760
from the snake venom and my wounds.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,400
My strength is down to a tenth.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
I can't use qinggong right now.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Oh.

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
Got it.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Second thing.

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,640
What does this Earth Seal Scroll
even look like?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,760
And why are we looking for it?

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Now that question

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
isn't so simple.

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,320
Most of the people
who come to me for info

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,920
are digging into treasure hunts
or ancient mysteries.

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
But tracking down a princess?

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,600
That's a first for me.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
What do you mean, Madam Yue?

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
Are you planning to break
your own rules?

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
It's not about breaking the rules.

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,080
It's just that I don't have
a clear answer to this issue right now.

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Hey.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,120
But it's not like it can't be solved.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,920
The Earth Seal Scroll
is inside the City Lord's Manor.

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
That item

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,080
has a deep connection
with Her Highness's true identity.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,520
If you can get your hands
on the Earth Seal Scroll,

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
then everything about her

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,440
will be easily resolved.

60
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,200
So, as long as we find
the Earth Seal Scroll,

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
it's the same as finding Lu Qianqian.

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,160
We'll find my sister?

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Sounds legit.

64
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,960
That means your top priority

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,440
is to cover us
while we enter the City Lord's Manor.

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
Think you can manage?

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
You doubt me?

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Who do you think I am?

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,200
If there's one thing I have,

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
it's my brilliant mind.

71
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,240
Oh?

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Let's hear it, then.

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,440
I actually know a great place
for our infiltration.

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
Yue, be careful.

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,880
This is your great idea?

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
(Changping Capital's Most Handsome)
You just don't get it.

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,240
Back when I was a kid,

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,120
getting into
the City Lord's Manor wasn't easy.

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,640
Hey,

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,360
but I made it in and out
like a breeze through this dog hole.

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Hey.

82
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,120
Hey!

83
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,560
Where did you go?

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,480
Yue, are you alright?

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Qingming!

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Why isn't the Crown Prince here yet?

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,560
Lu Buping!

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,680
Lu Buping!

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,360
Lu Buping!

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,360
Lu Buping!

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,520
Lu Buping!

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,200
Lu Buping!

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,240
What are you looking at?

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,200
That was totally uncalled for!

95
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,250
Keep your voice down!

96
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,820
- Who is it?
- Who's there?

97
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Oh no, we've been made!

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,760
Why don't we go check it out?

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,840
You go first.

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,480
Go on, you go first.

101
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
Oh no! Let's go!

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,950
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,980
Yeah, what are you doing?

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,760
Well, well, well...

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,280
Pretty bold of you, huh?

106
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,520
You even dared
to draw your blade in front of me?

107
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,760
We didn't recognize you.

108
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,510
- Please forgive me, Your Highness.
- My apologies, Your Highness.

109
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,470
You didn't recognize me?

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,760
Are you blind or what?

111
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,680
You didn't recognize

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,160
the Crown Prince?

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
I just saw

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,240
a bunch of folks
and thought we had an intruder.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,640
Nonsense!

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,880
You're saying I look like a thief?

117
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,160
Do I look like a thief?

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
Me?

119
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,800
Do I look like a thief?

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,440
Well...

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,280
Your Highness, your eye...

122
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,520
Curse you, Hua Qingming.

123
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
You hit me that hard?

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,760
Oh no, the bamboo mat is
starting to come loose.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
Yue, hold on tight.

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,760
It'll stay in place better.

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,600
What are your orders, Your Highness?

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,000
Ah, nothing. Nothing at all.

129
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,440
It's just that

130
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,600
I've been doing research lately.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,840
The Four Books, Five Classics,
and Spring and Autumn Annals.

132
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,440
Pulled too many all-nighters.

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
Oh...

134
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Your Highness, your nose is bleeding.

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
Didn't I say I've been
physically and mentally drained?

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,360
I just came out to get some fresh air
and unwind a bit.

137
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,320
By doing so,

138
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,760
I get to stretch my legs a little.

139
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,040
I can do some target practice too.

140
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
That's all.

141
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I just slipped by accident.

142
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,440
I fell!

143
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,120
Should I fetch a healer for you?

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,960
Never mind. Nope.

145
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Never mind.

146
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,160
I just kicked a practice target.

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,640
What could possibly go wrong?

148
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,320
Here, let me show you another one.

149
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,320
He's doing it again!

150
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,880
Three...

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,160
Two...

152
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,320
One...

153
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,280
Jump!

154
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,760
Don't move.

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,320
The ground is uneven.

156
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,120
I slipped again.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,000
Uneven ground?

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,720
It's fine, this is a chance
to stretch my splits.

159
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,160
If there's nothing else,
go on with your patrol.

160
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,240
I'll be heading back to rest soon.

161
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's go.

162
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,960
Hold on.

163
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
What is it, Your Highness?

164
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,400
You, let me borrow
that little mirror of yours.

165
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,520
Hand it over!

166
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Get lost!

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,560
Such a fancy little mirror.

168
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Even I don't have one this nice.

169
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,800
Lowly servants.

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
How dare you use
a mirror fancier than mine?

171
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Lu Buping

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
was blaming the uneven ground.

173
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,240
And he ended up in a split.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,680
Let's go.

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,840
You jerks!

176
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Why did you dodge?

177
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
My leg nearly broke!

178
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
You kicked us.

179
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,400
Why wouldn't we dodge?

180
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,440
And you two gave me
a black eye just now.

181
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,120
Isn't it fair I kicked you back?

182
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,840
Why didn't you just climb
out of the dog hole normally?

183
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
Why hide behind us and give us a start?

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,760
You had it coming.

185
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Why would I crawl through
the dog hole for no reason?

186
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
Who would do that willingly?

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm not a wanted criminal.

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
Of course I'd take the front gate!

189
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,900
(Storage Pavilion)

190
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
Close the door.

191
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,240
This is the storage pavilion
in the City Lord's Manor.

192
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,520
My dear old parents

193
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,320
stash all the important scrolls

194
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,840
and rare stuff in here.

195
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,680
Even the Earth Seal Scroll

196
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
might be tucked away in here.

197
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,080
Hey.

198
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
What's that look?

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,520
Why are you leaving me out?

200
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,600
Am I invisible to you?

201
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,160
Are we not a team?

202
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,080
Tch.

203
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,560
They have no respect for me.

204
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,420
When I find the Earth Seal Scroll first,

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,640
I'll show you both.

206
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,400
Lu Buping.

207
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,600
What are you doing?

208
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,040
Jeez!

209
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,560
Relax.

210
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,160
This place

211
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,920
just feels creepy.

212
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,160
Here, I'll stick this on you too.

213
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,760
This is a real talisman.

214
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,400
Not some random doodle
by a half-blind street priest.

215
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,760
Come on.

216
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,600
Stop that.

217
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Cut it out.

218
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,640
Cut it out.

219
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,990
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,480
On patrol?

221
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,760
Anything unusual?

222
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,320
Your Highness,

223
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
everything is normal.

224
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,820
Please, Your Highness.

225
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,360
Someone has been in here.

226
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,360
Hey!

227
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Mother?

228
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
What are you doing here?

229
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,120
Ping?

230
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Oh, Mother.

231
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,400
What brings you to the storage pavilion
so late at night?

232
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,680
That's something I should be asking you.

233
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,840
Why aren't you resting in your quarters?

234
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,000
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

235
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,440
I...

236
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,160
I...

237
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Ping,

238
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,280
what happened to your eye?

239
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,600
Mother.

240
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,120
I've been feeling like
I'm wasting too much time.

241
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
It's a real waste of life, you know?

242
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,320
A waste of life?

243
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,840
Exactly.

244
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
So,

245
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,480
I've been

246
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,840
reading all kinds of books
day and night.

247
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,920
I'm trying to gain knowledge
and aim for something higher in life.

248
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,480
Look, Mother.

249
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,360
See this black eye?

250
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,920
I mean,

251
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,200
this dark circle is
from all the late-night studying.

252
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,360
Is that true?

253
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Of course it's true.

254
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,240
How could I ever lie to you, Mother?

255
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,520
Yes, Your Highness,

256
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,040
the Crown Prince
has really been working hard.

257
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,640
I was just patrolling the manor earlier

258
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,880
and saw him worn out from reading.

259
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,640
He even started
practicing splits in the courtyard.

260
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes, exactly!

261
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,320
Show me the kind of books
you've been reading.

262
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,940
(Pig Feed Formulas
and Technological Improvements)

263
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,640
"Pig Feed Formulas
and Technological Improvements."

264
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,500
(Livestock Resource Section)

265
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,840
Hey, Mother.

266
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,560
Don't go thinking this pig feed formula
is something trivial.

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,080
I'm going to be the City Lord someday.

268
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,920
The first thing I should worry about is

269
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,400
whether the people in this city

270
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,480
have enough to eat.

271
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,120
Whether they can eat meat
with every meal.

272
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,000
Right?

273
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,560
That's livelihood, Mother.

274
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
Don't you agree?

275
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
That's a fair point.

276
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,440
I should take a copy too, Mother.

277
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,560
I shall study the same subject as well.

278
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,360
Come on, Mother.

279
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm already studying it.
