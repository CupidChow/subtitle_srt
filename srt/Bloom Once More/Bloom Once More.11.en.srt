13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,960
Hua.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,400
This is too much!

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
I got your paper crane

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
and came right away.

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,680
And this is what you wanted to show me?

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,120
Quit it.

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,600
Let's talk about serious matters.

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,440
Lass.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Was Hua bullying you again?

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,880
Be serious.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,640
Fine.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
Let's hear it.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,120
What's so urgent

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,520
you needed me in a hurry?

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
Lu Buping brought Yue and me

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,760
to the storage pavilion
in the City Lord's Manor.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,580
We discovered something strange
about the City Lord's identity.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
The City Lord's Manor?

31
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,560
Are you out of your minds?

32
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,800
Do you even realize

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
you two are wanted right now?

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,440
And with that Lu Buping?

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,200
I… You…

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,120
If you get caught there again,

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
no one will be able to save you.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Ye,

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
this is urgent.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,400
Hear me out,

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,600
and you'll understand why.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
It's snowing.

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
Let's talk inside.

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,680
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sure you'll find
my gift to your liking.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
This all started out simple.

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,040
We'd find the Earth Seal Scroll,
trade it for information on Lu Qianqian,

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,800
learn why Lu Li betrayed the nation,

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,720
and uncover the truth behind it all.

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,560
But now, things have gotten complicated.

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,160
Why is the City Lord
impersonating Her Highness?

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,360
And why did he want
the Suppressing Talisman?

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,240
What secret is he hiding?

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
So why did you call me here?

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
The tidal locking begins tonight.

56
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,380
We need to head back
to the storage pavilion again.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,720
We must obtain the scroll
before the City Lord gets to it.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
If he gets to it first,

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,120
we'll be at a huge disadvantage.

60
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,000
Then you two should stay out of it.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,760
I'll go.

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,280
At least if something happens,
I can get myself out quickly.

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
Ye,

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,800
we called you here

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,080
for something even more important.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,680
Aside from the scroll,

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,880
we need to find out the origin

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,280
of the Suppressing Talisman

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,880
and why the City Lord had it drawn
in the first place.

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
And where do I investigate that?

71
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Tianji Pavilion.

72
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,870
Zhuge Renfeng of Tianji Pavilion is well-versed
in all kinds of strange and obscure knowledge.

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,160
He'll know
where this talisman came from.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,860
My internal strength
has not fully recovered.

75
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,660
And Tianji Pavilion is a long journey
from here.

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,800
That is why

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,880
we're counting on you.

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,720
Master!

79
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,280
The Donghuang Bell has turned red!

80
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Master!

81
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,640
The Donghuang Bell has turned red!

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Hongyi.

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
He's here.

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
He?

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Him?

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,320
Go let him in.

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, Master.

88
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Thank you, Master Zhuge.

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Master.

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,200
Hua Qingming and Yue Qianxue encountered
some trouble on Changping Street.

91
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,840
To prove their innocence,

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,920
they asked me to seek your insight

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
regarding this talisman.

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,400
Heaven's thunder roars.

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
Earth's thunder rumbles.

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,780
All things lie in wait
beneath the stars.

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,160
The ward seals the vast unknown.

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,280
This Suppressing Talisman

99
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
should have been crafted by Weichen.

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,960
Weichen?

101
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
Weichen.

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,600
He used to be an ascetic
at Tianji Pavilion.

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,640
His ancestors were renowned shamans.

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
He had a deep understanding
of all kinds of talismanic arts.

105
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,480
Is he still at Tianji Pavilion?

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,600
He left the pavilion many years ago.

107
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
In his own words,

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,080
he still had attachments
to the mortal world,

109
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,520
so he followed the wind,

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,960
chasing traces of the moon.

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
Chasing the moon?

112
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,920
Who would have thought?

113
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,360
Even cultivators cannot escape
the bonds of worldly love.

114
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,320
Cultivators are human too.

115
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,720
And not just people.

116
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,480
No living thing can truly escape

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,920
the pull of emotion.
Not even the world itself.

118
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,600
Not even the world?

119
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
General Ye.

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
The Donghuang Bell

121
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,840
was born in the ancient seas.

122
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,180
It's one of the ten divine artifacts
of the old world.

123
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,400
Even it cannot escape

124
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,800
emotional entanglement.

125
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,160
The Donghuang Bell has feelings?

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course.

127
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
General Ye.

128
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,440
The Donghuang Bell is usually
surrounded by golden light.

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,800
When the world is at peace,
its glow is gentle and calm.

130
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,610
But when there is chaos and war,

131
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,320
the gold turns harsh and sharp.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
That is how

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
it shows its emotions toward the world.

134
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
Golden light?

135
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,920
But I saw it

136
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,840
glowing red.

137
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Was

138
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,120
I wrong?

139
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,080
General Ye.

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,560
There are some things

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
you will understand

142
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
when the time comes.

143
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
Listen.

144
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,040
You're lucky I, Lu Buping,

145
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
am open-minded and generous.

146
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,000
If it were anyone else,
you'd already be getting whipped.

147
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
Yes, yes.

148
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,600
You're humble and magnanimous.

149
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,490
Changping Capital is most fortunate
to have you.

150
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,760
Now that's what I like to hear.

151
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Whatever that "mag-something" was,

152
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,880
I didn't understand a word,

153
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,160
but it sure sounded impressive.

154
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,040
Eat.

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,800
You can't save my sister
on a hungry stomach.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
Eat up!

157
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,400
Thank you, Qingming.

158
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
We've eaten enough.

159
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Time to head out.

160
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,920
Hey, Fengchu.

161
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,720
Let me ask you something.

162
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,300
Here in Changping Capital,
besides Hua Qingming and Ye Weiming,

163
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,890
who do you think
is the strongest fighter?

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
Obviously, it's the two of us.

165
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,320
We don't even need to talk about
the distant places.

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,990
Just right here
in the City Lord's Manor,

167
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,720
as long as we work together,

168
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,800
who in this world would dare invade?

169
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,680
Haha!

170
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,360
That's right.

171
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,640
With the two of us guarding this place,

172
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,880
even a fly

173
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
wouldn't get past us,

174
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,680
never mind

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,000
a person.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,960
Of course!

177
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,920
Come on.

178
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Idiots.

179
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,280
All they ever do is brag.

180
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,440
It's a bit chilly.

181
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,640
Wolong, someone talking smack about you
behind your back?

182
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
What did you just say?

183
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,400
Who do they take after?

184
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Come on.

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
It is a bit chilly.

186
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
What are you doing?

187
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,840
Stop pawing at me!

188
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,640
Let's go.

189
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,240
Go on ahead.

190
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,480
I've got

191
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,000
your backs.

192
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,600
(What…)

193
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,760
(What's going on?)

194
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,200
(Was…)

195
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,800
(Was it all just a dream?)

196
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Yue Qianxue.

197
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,280
Just die already.

198
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,000
Once you're dead,

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,760
Changping Capital will belong to Ximu!

200
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,320
Ms. Xue.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,280
No.

202
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
Yue Qianxue.

203
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,560
You should die by yourself.

204
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm not going with you.

205
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,000
- Die!
- Die!

206
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,560
- Die!
- Die!

207
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Yue Qianxue,

208
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,200
don't you see it yet?

209
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,200
It's Qingming who wants you dead.

210
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,960
I told you.

211
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,960
The one who wants you dead is Qingming.

212
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Hua Qingming!

213
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,760
Oh?

214
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
Lord Zhenbei.

215
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
How pathetic.

216
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,680
I thought you wanted my life?

217
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,840
Yue…

218
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:01,720
Your shoe…

219
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,240
Yue…

220
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280
Yue.

221
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,200
Look at him.

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,720
Doesn't he look just like a dog?

223
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,240
Hehe…

224
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,040
"Pregnant sows

225
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
shouldn't be fed wine lees
in late term".

226
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,320
How amusing.

227
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,680
Interesting.

228
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,400
Hua Qingming!

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,320
Something doesn't look right.

230
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,800
Hurry up! Time's running out!

231
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,360
Yue Qianxue!

232
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,080
Hua Qingming!

233
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,480
What are you guys doing?

234
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
Hurry up!

235
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,640
Dear me!

236
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,640
Move!

237
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
Qingming.

238
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,600
Look at that pitiful face of hers.

239
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
Kill her.
