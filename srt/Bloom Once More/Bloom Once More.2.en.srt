00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,620
(First lifetime, 6th year of Tianyuan)

(Hua)

Qingming.

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
What sword is this?

18
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,820
It's so pretty.

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,780
This sword is called Huaxuan.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,460
(Moon)
And this one is called Yueying.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,620
(Hua, Moon)

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,300
I specially

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,060
commissioned them from Tiangong Forge.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,820
Now that you've returned
from Tianji Pavilion,

25
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,140
I believe you'll soon
be able to stand on your own.

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,060
If one day I'm away,

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,460
then Huaxuan will be me.

28
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,660
It will always stay by your side.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,300
Huaxuan and Yueying...

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,900
The flower and the Moon.

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,300
This time, I don't need Huaxuan.

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,060
I want Yueying.

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,580
Only I

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,940
can save my own life.

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,740
Lord Zhenbei and Ms. Yue
are discussing inside.

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,340
I'll let you know when to...

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,980
The little girl
is quite full of herself.

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,020
(Yao Wei, City Garrison Commander)
By order of the City Lord...

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Apologize to Chan.

40
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,460
Yue...

41
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,340
(Lu Buping, Crown Prince)

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,580
How impressive.

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,340
I told my man to come
and arrest someone,

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,540
and you actually
made him apologize to a maid.

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,660
Lord Zhenbei,

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,620
you clearly don't take me
seriously at all.

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,340
Take them away.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,700
If Your Highness thinks
so little of Lord Zhenbei...

49
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,580
What if I, Lord Zhennan,
join the picture too?

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,100
Ye Weiming?

51
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,420
Forget all the Lordly nonsense.

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,260
If you're so capable,
ask my father to title you

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,820
as the Crown Prince!

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,020
You lot are getting out of hand.

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,380
City Lord's Seal.

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,220
Surely Your Highness can recognize it.

57
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,260
(Seal)

58
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,060
Fine.

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,620
Just wait till I become
the City Lord myself.

60
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
You'll see.

61
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,020
You just wait!

62
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,180
Hey, let's go.

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,140
Lass.

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,180
(Ye Weiming, Lord Zhennan,
Changping Capital)

65
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,980
It's been a while.

66
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,220
Hua Qingming! Hua Qingming!

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,620
Hua Qingming!

(Young Ye Weiming, Early Education)

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,660
Who is this little girl?

70
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,980
Her name is

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,100
Yue Qianxue.

72
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,180
Lass.

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,500
Come on.

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,460
I will take you to the lantern fair.

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,300
Yue...

76
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,660
(Seal)
Lord Zhennan has the City Lord's seal.

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,700
Lord Zhenbei doesn't.

78
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,300
You think my word means nothing?

79
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,220
How about the City Lord's seal?

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,100
Huh?

81
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,580
Don't be afraid of him.

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,620
Come with me.

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,940
Hey.

84
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,660
Buping, don't you remember
your promise to me?

85
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,740
My face is still
stinging from that slap.

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,980
When did Lord Zhennan get back?

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,140
And how is he holding my father's seal?

88
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,380
This is so annoying.

89
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,300
What are you mumbling about?

90
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,820
Your sister got bullied,
and you're just going to do nothing?

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,380
Oh, come on.

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,820
Qianqian,

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,060
don't worry.

94
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,180
Once I become the City Lord,

95
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,060
- I'll crush them.
- Your Highness.

96
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,660
Your Highness.

97
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,380
This is the premium ginseng
we prepared for His Majesty.

98
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,860
Shall we send it over now?

99
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,220
Perfect timing.

100
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,980
I'll deliver it myself.

101
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,660
What about me?

102
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,820
I'm on it right now.

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,260
Right now, I swear.

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,780
Lass, you know what?

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,380
The enemy was unbelievably weak.

106
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,620
I charged in on horseback,

107
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,180
and had them scattering like rats.

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,900
They swore never to return again.

109
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,300
They even gave us piles of treasure.

110
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,220
And one more thing.

111
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,500
The City Lord was so pleased,

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,180
he rewarded me
with the City Lord's seal.

113
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,980
Hehe!

114
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,780
And after three years
guarding the border,

115
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,780
my martial arts have improved
by leaps and bounds.

116
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,740
That boring Hua guy

117
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,300
can't beat me now.

118
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,420
One day,

119
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm going to duel him.

120
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,540
Lass.

121
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,940
(This moment in a past life)

122
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,780

♪Like the hand you held,
the years we walked through together♪

124
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:03,460
♪All has turned to nothing,

125
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,860
Is it pretty?

126
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,420
It's pretty.

127
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,220
You are the prettiest.

128
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,380
Here, take this.

129
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,060
Lass, don't pay attention
to that gloomy guy.

130
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,340
Come on, I will take you somewhere fun.

131
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,260
Hey, wait!

132
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,260
This suits you better.

133
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,020
Let's go.

134
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,820
Hey, where are you two going?

135
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,220
The fun stuff is that way!

136
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,980
(Can't you just listen to me once?)

137
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,340
(No.)

138
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,380
(Qingming and I are the real family.)

139
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,660
Mm.

140
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,460
Lass?

141
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,340
Thank you.

142
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,740
What's wrong? You don't look happy.

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,620
Did that Hua Hua Qingming bully you?

144
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,140
Just you wait!

145
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,740
Hua Qingming! Yue Qianxue!

146
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,620
Wait till my father heard about this!

147
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,460
And that...

148
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,580
Ye Weiming!

149
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,020
Your Highness,
did you see a man in black just now?

150
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,060
A man in black?

151
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,300
Aren't you wearing black right now?

152
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,180
Wait till my father heard about this!

153
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,580
I'll tell him of your crimes!

154
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,820
I'll just walk over there myself.

155
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
Speak.

156
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,980
What exactly are you planning?

157
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,420
Ye Weiming.

158
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,220
What are you doing here?

159
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,380
Perfect timing.

160
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,700
You just wait.

161
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,940
Father, I brought you something great!

162
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,580
Lass.

163
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,180
Did you catch him?

164
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,540
He flew off.

165
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,660
What's wrong with you?

166
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
What's wrong, Father?

167
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,620
Guards! There's an assassin!

168
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,580
Hurry up!

169
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,620
Ugh!

170
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,980
Can you even do this or not?

171
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,120
Can you treat him or not?

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,380
Your Highness.

173
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,940
I...

174
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,420
I've never seen
such a serious condition.

175
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,780
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

176
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,460
I have a way.

177
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,500
Hmm?

178
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,460
You? Even the best doctor in the city

179
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,980
has never seen such a case.

180
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,900
And you have a way?

181
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,980
What can you possibly do?

182
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,380
There's no harm in trying.

183
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Mother.

184
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,740
I think Ms. Yue looks clever and kind.

185
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,180
She doesn't seem malicious.

186
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,700
If she says she has a way,
then why not let her try?

187
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,700
She doesn't seem malicious?

188
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,300
How do you explain this?

189
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,820
I found this on my father just now.

190
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,820
That bell used to hang
on Yue Qianxue all the time.

191
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,020
And you, Ye Weiming!

192
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,180
Right before my father collapsed,
you were right outside.

193
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,140
If it wasn't you two,

194
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
who else could it be?

195
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,500
I am shocked to hear that.

196
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,540
Your Majesty.

197
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,380
Ms. Yue and I were
at the lantern fair together.

198
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,620
A man in black appeared

199
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,420
and stole the bell.

200
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,980
We chased him here.

201
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Ye Weiming, after all
the trust my father had in you?

202
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,620
A man in black?
You're the only one in black here!

203
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,580
There's your man in black.

204
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,100
So there really is one.

205
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,820
Saving him is our top priority.

206
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,220
Given the City Lord's condition,

207
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,660
I fear we have mere minutes

208
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,140
to save his life.

209
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,020
But...

210
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,620
My father!

211
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,220
Move!

212
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,260
Ah! This is treason!

213
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,940
Yue Qianxue!

214
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Seize them!
