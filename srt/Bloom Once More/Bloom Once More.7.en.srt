It's getting late.

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,060
If there's nothing else,

51
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,020
you should head back to get some rest.

52
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,820
Yes.

How is he doing?

55
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,820
It's nothing serious.

56
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,490
It's just that he's had this new injury
before the old one is healed.

57
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,220
His body can't really take it anymore.

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,900
So he needs some time to recuperate.

59
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,160
He won't be able
to fight as well during this time.

60
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm afraid he can't fight anymore.

61
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,460

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,340

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,460
It feels familiar,

64
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,860
But I can't recall exactly where it is.

65
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,740
It's the Dongbi Academy.

66
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,300
That year,

67
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,620
Hua Qingming and I
started our education here.

68
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,460
And one day,

69
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,700
Hua Qingming was outside
under the big tree

70
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,460
and met a little girl.

71
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,700
Well,

72
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,540
why has the academy turned into this?

73
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,820
Mr. Dongchan

74
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,700
was learned and modest.

75
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,980
In the first year of Tianyuan,

76
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,060
there was a rumor

77
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,420
that he was a spy from Ximu.

78
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,960
His Majesty ordered the academy shut
and his home raided.

79
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,600
In the end, he died unjustly.

80
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,660
Dongbi Academy

81
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,460
was shut down.

82
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,780
And it has remained closed since

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
Mr. Dongchan was a spy from Ximu?

84
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,300
In the third year of Tianyuan,

85
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,610
I became Deputy Military Judge
of the city garrison

86
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,980
and finally investigated the truth.

87
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,220
He was innocent.

88
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
He had just saved a dying Ximu citizen

89
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,860
without knowing their identity.

90
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,220
Yet he was falsely accused of treason.

91
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,260
A death in vain.

92
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,260
Well, I know that all too well.

93
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,180
Lass.

94
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,180
You and Hua
have been acting strange lately.

95
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,860
What's going on?

96
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,420
Can you tell me?

97
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,740
Weiming.

98
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,020
Do you believe in rebirth?

99
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,020
Qi!

100
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,580
Can you stop pacing around?

101
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,900
You're making me anxious.

102
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,780
Aren't you pacing around too?

103
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,060
Well,

104
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,020
I'm pacing

105
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,340
because I'm worried about Ms. Yue.

106
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,980
Well, I'm worried about His Lordship.

107
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,380
Lord Zhenbei is a martial master

108
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,900
and the strongest in Changping Capital.

109
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,380
What's there to worry about?

110
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,980
But Ms. Yue...

111
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,100
Even if His Lordship is powerful,

112
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,660
he almost got killed

113
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,860
from the poison.

114
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,060
Besides,

115
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,140
with His Lordship protecting Ms. Yue,
there's nothing to worry about.

116
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,780
Hmm, that's true.

117
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
His Lordship really dotes on her.

118
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,220
If he's safe,

119
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,900
he won't abandon her.

120
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm really envious of them.

121
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,900
Well, envy as you like.

122
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,940
Ms. Yue is fortunate enough
to have received His Lordship's favor.

123
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,660
As for you,

124
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,980
wait for your next life.

125
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,420
Qi! Get over here!

126
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,780
Yao Wei?

127
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,700
What are you here for at this late hour?

128
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,140
Search!

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,290
This is the Lord Zhenbei's Mansion!

130
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,500
What do you think you're doing?

131
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,980
Take both of them back.

132
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,500
Interrogate them thoroughly!

133
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,980
I'm His Lordship's trusted aide.

134
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,460
Chan is just a maid.

135
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,620
Come at me if you can.

136
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,220
Stop bullying her!

137
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,740
It sounds like

138
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
I'm just the extra

139
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,180
in this whole story.

140
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,940
Why would you say so?

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,360
Both Hua and I

142
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,540
died in battle
in the ninth year of Tianyuan.

143
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,500
But I never got this so-called rebirth.

144
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,860
So in this story,

145
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,020
I'm a mere fixed variable.

146
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,680
One that can't change the future.

147
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,780
I'm redundant.

148
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,020
But we just need
to stop it all from happening, no?

149
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,540
It's morning.

150
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,790
I need to return
to the City Lord's Manor.

151
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,780
Don't worry.

152
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,540
Even without those past-life memories,

153
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,140
I still believe in you two.

154
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,300
If that day ever truly comes...

155
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,260
Forget it.

156
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,580
As long as you believe in me too.

157
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,820
He got away?

158
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,700
Your Majesty.

159
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,860
Hua Qingming's lightness skill
surpasses mine.

160
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,460
So I couldn't catch him.

161
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,020
Hua Qingming is badly injured.

162
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,220
And I even shot him with an arrow.

163
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,740
He still managed to get away, huh?

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,500
Please pardon me for my incompetence.

165
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
Lord Zhennan.

166
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,260
Hua Qingming is exceptionally gifted.

167
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,980
It's not so easy to catch him.

168
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,940
So you needn't blame yourself for it.

169
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,780
I'll sharpen my skills

170
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,140
to make sure this doesn't happen again.

171
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,300
Forget it.

172
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,980
As for Hua Qingming's attendants,
Qi and Chan,

173
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,220
I've already thrown them
into the dungeon.

174
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,620
Knowing his personality,

175
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,620
he'll definitely come back for them.

176
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,900
When that time comes,

177
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,460
we'll ambush and capture him.

178
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,620
I'd like to find out for myself

179
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,420
why Hua Qingming
betrayed Changping Capital

180
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,620
and sided with Ximu.

181
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,540
Your Majesty.

182
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,180
I believe

183
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,020
Hua Qingming
is loyal to Changping Capital.

184
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,140
He would never

185
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,620
commit treason.

186
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,300
Enough.

187
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,820
We'll wait until the truth is found.

188
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,740
You may leave.

189
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,500
You're awake, Qingming!

191
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,940
I'll go light a fire
and make you something to eat.

192
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,620
Hold on.

193
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,340
Is this...

194
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,860
the Dongbi Academy?

195
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,100
Did you bring me here?

196
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,460
Weiming brought us here last night.

197
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,420
I can't recall that.

198
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,100
I just remember us escaping
the City Lord's Manor last night.

199
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,820
Everything went black all of a sudden.

200
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,960
And I don't remember
what happened after that.

201
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,980
So it was Ye.

202
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,220
So, what do we do now?

203
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,180
We need to get to the bottom

204
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,380
of Lu Li's ties to Ximu.

205
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,700
From what happened after your rebirth,

206
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,300
it seems there's also something
between Lu Li and the Princess.

207
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,300
Thus, the Princess
is our only clue for now.

208
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,300
According to Lu Qianqian's maid,

209
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,700
after she sucked the poison
from your finger that day,

210
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,900
she vanished without a trace.

211
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,460
She didn't suck my finger.

212
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,940
I accidentally got bitten
by a snake that day.

213
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,260
And she just insisted
on sucking out the venom.

214
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,740
She insisted on doing so
and you just let her?

215
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,160
Couldn't you have done it yourself?

216
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,620
It was an emergency.

217
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:20,820
Wait a second,

218
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,620
Yue.

219
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,220
Why are you derailing the topic?

220
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,420
Alright, I was just teasing you.

221
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,580
Our priority now

222
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,460
is to find the missing Lu Qianqian.

223
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,060
But where do we even start?

224
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,780
Looks like...

225
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,940
we'll have to go to Zhuge Renfeng.

226
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,780
You two.

227
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,180
If it's a matter of the martial world,

228
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,480
you've come to the wrong place.

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,320
Please enlighten us, Master Zhuge.

230
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,380
Have you heard of

231
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,980
Fallen Blossom Lane?

232
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,380
I've heard of it.

233
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,060
But I know nothing about it.

234
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,660
Fallen Blossom Lane

235
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,140
is a lawless region
of the martial world.

236
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,940
It's where all sorts
of wanted people and misfits are.

237
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,340
It's also the biggest hub
of information in the world.

238
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,740
Its master is named Yue Yong.

239
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,340
She's a woman,

240
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,780
but she only enjoys drinking
with other women.

241
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,300
She's got a rule.

242
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,220
If a woman she fancies

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,620
can drink three cups with her,

244
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,020
she gets to ask her three questions.

245
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,140
And she will

246
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,380
answer them all without reservation.

247
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,460
Qingming.

248
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,020
Are you done changing yet?

249
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,900
It's been an hour.

250
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,500
Wait.

251
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm almost done.

252
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,300
