and I'll go from "Lu Buping"
to "Lu Pingping"!

76
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Lu Buping, did you bring the talisman?

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
What talisman?

78
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,520
The Suppressing Talismans.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,990
The Suppressing Talisman?

80
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,600
You told me those couldn't seal ghosts.

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
Why would I bring them?

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,920
I already threw all of them away.

83
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,240
The moment the two of us touched
the Earth Seal Scroll,

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,640
we both fell into an illusion.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
This talisman must be connected to that.

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
You mean the Suppressing Talisman

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,760
is required

88
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,520
to take the Earth Seal Scroll?

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,720
If I'd known that,
I wouldn't have tossed it…

90
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,320
(Suppressing Talisman)

91
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,880
Ye Weiming?

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,260
(Earth Seal Scroll)

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
According to Zhuge Renfeng,

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,240
the talisman

95
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,120
was likely created by Taoist Weichen.

96
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,440
He was once an ascetic
of the Tianji Pavilion.

97
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
A few years back,

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,990
he said he still had worldly attachments
and wandered off chasing the moon.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,680
No one knows where he is now.

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,160
So

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,760
that lead's gone cold?

102
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,640
Let's set that aside for now.

103
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,890
Since we already have
the Earth Seal Scroll,

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,760
our priority is to go to Yue Yong

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,720
and get information about the princess.

106
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,160
Wait.

107
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,280
This thing is that powerful?

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
It can drag people into illusions?

109
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,760
And my father disguised himself
as my mother.

110
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,990
Are we not going to investigate that?

111
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Lu Buping,

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,040
don't you want to know
what happened to the princess?

113
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
My sister?

114
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,600
Of course, I worry about her.

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,000
The sooner we get intelligence on her,

116
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,640
the safer she'll be.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Qingming is right.

118
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Every second we delay adds

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,400
to the danger she's in.

120
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,840
Getting to Fallen Blossom Lane
and retrieving the information

121
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,120
on Lu Qianqian comes first.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
As for the Earth Seal Scroll...

123
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,520
Ye.

124
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,840
Speak.

125
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,000
Among all of us,
you have the best skills.

126
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,280
When Yue Yong is distracted,

127
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,850
you sneak in and take it back.

128
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,960
It's not stealing.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
It's called retrieving.

130
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
Since we're ready,

131
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,040
let's head

132
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,280
to Fallen Blossom Lane.

133
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
All right!

134
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,160
I'll go grab your dress!

135
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
Lu Buping, get the rouge and powder.

136
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
We'll do Qingming's makeup and head out.

137
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,920
Madam,

138
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,960
per your orders, Zhao Laosan
has been sent out.

139
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,520
That sleazeball got lucky.

140
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,200
Madam, are you sure it's all right

141
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,560
to have him handle this?

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,640
Neither of them are good people anyway.

143
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
Let fate take its course.

144
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,240
Oh,

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,160
and prepare some fine wine.

146
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,240
We're expecting a special guest.

147
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:37,880
Yes,

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,680
Madam.

149
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,200
Wait.

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,040
Clean this for me.

151
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,600
You're here,

152
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Miss.

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,400
Amazing.

154
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,840
In just two days, you managed
to obtain the Earth Seal Scroll.

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
M...

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Madam.

157
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,280
I've brought you the Earth Seal Scroll.

158
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,720
Could you tell us about the princess?

159
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,400
What's the rush?

160
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,920
Look at you. Your face's all gaunt.

161
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Since you're already here,

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,520
why not stay and chat with me a little?

163
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,560
Where are you from?

164
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,360
That hairpin on your head looks fancy.

165
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,520
It looks expensive.

166
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Don't tell me

167
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,560
you stole it off the princess, hm?

168
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:12,200
Sister...

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
Lu Buping, if you keep that up,

170
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,380
you'll summon your sister's spirit
back from the grave.

171
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,760
That's right.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,780
That's what I'll do!

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360
Sister...

174
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,080
Sister...

Sister...

179
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm not in the habit
of answering questions.

180
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,600
You've got decent skills.

181
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Too bad you've got no internal energy.

182
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,480
Sister...

183
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,720
Poxiao?

184
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,520

185
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,360
Cut the nonsense.

186
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,600
Wait.

187
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,680
Madam Yue.

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,040

189
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
You're fast with your hands.

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
Give it back.

191
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,600
(Weichen)
What's your relationship with Weichen?

192
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
(This is my personal jade pendant.)

193
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
(I'm willing to leave the monastic life for you.)

194
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,400
Your Majesty.

195
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,880
According to the divination,

196
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,200
the child in your womb is aligned
with the Tianshu Star.

197
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,360
A star of power and dominion
over Changping Capital.

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,680
You must pray frequently

199
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,920
and seek fortune,

200
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,560
to avoid misfortune or calamity.

201
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Thank you for your enlightenment.

202
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,840
Hongyue.

203
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,240
Hongyue.

204
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,200
This is the finest tribute tea
of the year.

206
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
His Majesty asked me to bring it to you.

207
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,800
You're too kind, Your Majesty.

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,000
Please thank His Majesty

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,560
on my behalf.

210
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,280
Weichen.

211
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,600
Yes, Master.

212
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,440
You're holding the brush wrong.

213
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,280
In that case, you can show me how.

214
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,580
How long have you been standing there?

215
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Not long.

216
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,280
I brought your favorite sweet dumplings.

217
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
Liar.

218
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
Your umbrella is covered
in a thick layer of snow.

219
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,040
I bet you've been here for two hours.

220
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,440
Hongyue.

221
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
(Weichen)

222
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,520
This is my personal jade pendant.

223
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,280
It was carved for me by my parents

224
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,280
the moment I was born.

225
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm willing to leave the monastic life

226
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,440
for you.

227
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,540
