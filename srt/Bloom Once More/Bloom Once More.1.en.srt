Lu Li! I'll make you pay for this!

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,400
It was the 8th year of Tianyuan...

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
You were killed by Lu Li.

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,160
What do you mean?

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
It's only the 6th year of Tianyuan.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,840
We just got back
from studying at Tianji Pavilion.

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,960
The northern border has seen
frequent barbarian raids lately.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Shall we send reinforcements
to strengthen the defenses?

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,680
(Hua Qingming, Lord Zhenbei)
I'll discuss it with His Majesty.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
If there's nothing else,

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
you may leave for now.

38
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,920
Yes, sir.

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,520
Lord Zhenbei is bathing.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,260
You may not enter.

Step aside.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,160
Hua Qingming,
why did you abandon Luori City?

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,990
Why cut off my supplies
to the border troops?

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,320
Yue...

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Three months
of studying at Tianji Pavilion

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,600
certainly developed
quite the temper on you.

matters with Lord Zhenbei.

50
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Please step aside.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
That's enough!

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
Hua Qingming, why did you betray me?

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000

(Yue)

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
Qingming told me to bring his Yueying

65
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
for the severing of your head.

66

as long as we hang your head

we'll open the granaries

But if you live,

139
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,960
then everyone in this city
will die with you.

If it weren't for General Yue,

160
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
you'd have all been...

161
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,000
I risked everything to protect you.

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,160
And yet,
you believe the barbarians' lies?

sacrifice yourself for the country.

Lu Qianqian, what are you trying to say?

167
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,200
The northern war
has raged for over ten months.

168
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,680
Changping Capital can
no longer hold out.

169
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,960
Qingming has already reached
an agreement with the barbarians.

170
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,400
As long as Yue Qianxue
hands over her head,

171
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,000
and surrenders Luori City
to the barbarians,

172
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,520
they will withdraw their troops

173
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,040
and negotiate a truce.

174
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,800
Impossible.

175
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,320
Just three days ago,
Hua Qingming sent me a letter.

176
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,850
He said the supplies from the rear
would soon reach Luori City.

177
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,710
Why would he agree
to a land-for-peace deal now?

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,400
Don't be naive,

179
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,200
Yue Qianxue.

180
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,360
If the deal hadn't been made long ago,

181
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,760
how else

182
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,960
do you think I made it
into Luori City safe and sound?

183
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,400
Lu Li.

184
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,990
Lu Qianqian is shaking
the troops' morale.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,840
Seize her.

186
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,320
Yes, madam.

187
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,640
General Yue.

188
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
After all these years,

189
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,800
you shall die today.

190
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,480
Lu Li, I'll make you pay for this!

191
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,520
Chan!

192
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,440
Chan!

193
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Yue Qianxue...

194
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,520
Don't blame me for this.

195
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,340
Qingming really told me to do this.

196
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,120
Qingming.

197
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,040
Tell me.

198
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
If I really held Luori City alone,

199
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,300
and Changping Capital
had no strength left to send aid,

200
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,600
would you come to save me?

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
I would.

202
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
No, you wouldn't.

203
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,400
You would even give someone your Yueying

204
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,680
just to have my head cut off.

205
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,560
Yue...

206
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,160
How do you know
that sword is called Yueying?

207
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
Of course I know.

208
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
Two years ago...

209
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
No...

210
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,720
It was today.

211
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,140
(First lifetime after Yue's death)

212
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,840
Among General Yue's belongings,
a bell was found.

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,160
(The 9th year of Tianyuan,
The fall of Changping Capital)

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,960
Yue...

215
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,760
I've come to see you.
