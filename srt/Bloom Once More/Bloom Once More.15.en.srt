13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,120
Are you alright, Yue?

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm fine. What about you?

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm alright too.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,480
Hongyue.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Hongyue.

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Hongyue.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,360
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,040
Hongyue!

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
I was worried sick about you.

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,440
Let me have Qianqian.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,840
But Your Majesty, didn't you just...

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,760
I got lucky
and managed to dodge the pursuers.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
It's that person.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
Should we go help Hongyue?

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
No, Master Zhuge said

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
we can't do anything

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
inside the Reversal Realm.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,560
If we get hurt or die here,

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,320
it could affect us in the real world.

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
So we mustn't act rashly.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,320
Attack!

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,840
Darn it!

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
It's just a piece of wood!

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Master ordered you to take the Earth
Seal Scroll to Changping Capital.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
From there, push things forward slowly.

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,040
There's a six-pointed star birthmark
on Lu Qianqian's back shoulder,

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
which is a mark
of the Overlord Star reborn.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,960
A six-pointed star?

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
It's Lu Li.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Master said this thing was gifted
by the barbarians' Grand Shaman.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
Inside is the ancient forbidden spell,
the Bloodseal Cross Curse.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,520
This curse

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,720
can suppress the nation's fortune
across Changping Capital.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,800
We were just about
to take Changping Capital with ease.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,880
Then suddenly Lu Qianqian showed up.

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
I was wondering

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
why Master would
have me disguise myself like this

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
just to capture a baby.

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,200
Originally,
we could've completed the mission

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,320
just by planting
the Bloodseal Cross Curse

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,940
in the dragon vein of Changping Capital.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,760
Who knew Her Highness
would give birth to the Overlord Star?

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,600
An Overlord Star

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,440
protects the country and its people.

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,880
If we can't get rid
of Lu Qianqian today,

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,520
the Earth Seal Scroll
won't be able to unleash its full power.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,160
And it'll all go to waste.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,320
If so, I'll find Lu Qianqian at once

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,640
and eliminate her.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Sir.

63
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,320
The incense stick's
more than halfway burned.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
They're not awake yet.

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Has something gone wrong?

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,920
Before the incense finishes burning,

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,120
use the Reversal Spell.

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
That'll let them resonate
with the Donghuang Bell here

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,680
and return to the real world.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,360
It's not over yet.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
So don't panic,

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
General Ye.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Yue.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,760
I didn't expect you to be the Overlord Star
of Changping Capital.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
There's no rushing this.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,373
To destroy the Overlord Star,

77
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:42,520
it must be done
on the Ghost Festival of a yin year.

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
That won't work today.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,640
We'll have to wait until the Ghost Festival
22 years from now.

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
Isn't that the eighth year of Tianyuan?

81
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
Who's there?

82
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,900
Let's go!

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,480
So these two sneaky mice
have been hiding here.

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,760
How dare you, Lu Li!

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,960
These two brats actually know my name.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Did I say my name earlier?

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,240
Interesting.

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,800
Looks like you've got some skills.

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,784
Yue, some of my power has returned.

90
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:31,390
But it's only enough to protect myself.
I can't defend you at the same time.

91
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,030
I'll draw their attention later.

92
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,640
You use the Reversal Spell
Master Zhuge taught you

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,860
and get back to the real world.

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,000
What about you?

95
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,720
Lu Li can never keep me here.

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,760
Go now!

97
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
Don't distract me.

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
Qingming.

99
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,560
Qingming!

100
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Qingming!

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Wake up already, Qingming!

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Wake up!

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,880
What's happened, lass?

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,280
That mysterious man...

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
Lu Li is that mysterious man.

106
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,640
They found out about us.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,720
To protect me,
he told me to return here.

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,960
He's still dealing
with both Lu Li and Her Majesty.

109
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,840
Wake up already, Qingming!

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
Sir.

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
What do we do?

112
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
I thought you were something else.

113
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
It turned out
that you've been exhausted.

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
You did so
to make that lady leave, didn't you?

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,200
Forcing your meridians open, huh?

116
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,840
You're courting death.

117
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,080
The incense is out.

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
He still hasn't woken up.

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Is he not going to wake up again?

120
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,920
Master Zhuge!

121
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,320
Well...

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
It's not like there's no way.

123
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
It was an incense stick worth of time

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,680
because the Donghuang Bell
didn't have enough power.

125
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,280
Then how can we power it up?

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,480
A thousand years ago,

127
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,320
the Donghuang Bell faced a demonic war.

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,320
It cracked.

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,400
The shattered fragments

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
turned into the Donghuang Chime.

131
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,960
And the remnant soul of those fragments
scattered across the world.

132
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
You once asked me

133
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,360
why the Donghuang Bell
glowed red with power.

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
It's calling you back.

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Ye Weiming.

136
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,440
Do you still remember

137
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,200
who you are?

138
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
I...

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
I am...

140
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
the remnant soul of the Donghuang Bell.

141
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,760
There is still a chance
to save Hua Qingming.

142
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,520
But that one chance

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
is in your hands.

144
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
Today, a young man.

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,040
Tomorrow, an old man.

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
The mountains

147
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
remain the same.

148
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Yet he is

149
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,000
worn and weary.

150
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
Weiming!

151
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,680
No!

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,400
Why are you shaking your head, lass?

153
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,200
Isn't this just fine?

154
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,320
No, it's not!

155
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,080
There must be another way.

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,440
We don't have to sacrifice you.

157
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,480
Sir!

158
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,720
Sir!

159
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,320
Sir!

160
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,680
Sir!

161
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
Look.

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
Qingming is still sitting there!

163
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
He's just dreaming

164
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,680
and not awake yet.

165
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,920
There must be another way, right?

166
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
Sir!

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,920
Sir!

168
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
(The Reversal Realm
is a world of its own.)

169
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,990
(There are a multitude of ways
in this world.)

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,560
(The Reversal Realm and the real world
each have their path.)

171
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
This Donghuang Bell

172
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,000
is just a node linking the cosmos.

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,080
This is more than a dream.

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,240
Lass.

175
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,840
It's all right.

176
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
I really think this is a good idea.

177
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,693
At first, I thought the two of you
were reborn with the Donghuang Bell,

178
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,720
and I was a mere outsider.

179
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,760
But it seems like

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,920
I'm actually at the heart of this story.

181
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm truly happy.

182
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
Besides,

183
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,880
if I really am the remnant soul
of the Donghuang Bell,

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
that means

185
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm part of the ten great
ancient divine artifacts.

186
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,880
Hua can never outshine me in this life.

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
I finally beat him once.

188
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,960
Lass, look after Hua for me.

189
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,720
Will you?

190
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,200
Take good care of him.

191
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
Please.

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,700
♪I wish every memory could freeze
in this single moment♪

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,700
♪So I would no longer
be bound by longing♪

194
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,660
♪For a thousand years,
we've gazed apart, separated by time♪

195
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Hua Qingming.

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,160
My name is Ye Weiming.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
Never forget me.

198
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,060
♪The moonlight fills your eyes as you struggle
to break free from your chains♪

199
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,740
♪Fate, ever so cruel,
plays me for a fool♪

200
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,980
♪When will the moon be whole again?
When will we be together once more?♪

201
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:55,540
♪Wandering alone through
a thousand years of moonlight and memories♪

202
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,360
I am Lord Zhennan, Ye Weiming!

203
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,920
Hua Qingming!

204
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,040
Here, take this.

205
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
(I shall be)

206
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,360
(the very first ray
of sunlight at dawn.)

207
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,520
(And I'll stay by your side
to protect you.)

208
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,280
Just accept your fate, brat.

209
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,820
♪Embrace the bond
we've guarded through lifetimes♪

210
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,580
♪I'll be the flame of fate,
flying to you like a moth to flame♪

211
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
Hua Qingming.

212
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Are you all right?

213
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,520
Ye Weiming? What are you doing here?

214
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,920
Why?

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,880
Can't I be here

216
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,320
since you're here too?

217
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,440
You're such a selfish guy.

218
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,200
The incense has burned out.

219
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,920
I don't think I can go back.

220
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,880
Just try the Reversal Spell
and you'll know.

221
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

222
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Come on, just give it a shot already.

223
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,240
Thank you for your time.

224
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,120
Goodbye.

225
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,400
Goodbye.

226
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Qingming!

227
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
You're back.

228
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,960
What's the matter, Yue?

229
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Poxiao?

230
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,240
Why is it with me?

231
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,360
Weiming is...

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,800
It's fine.

233
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,400
It's just that my heart aches a bit.

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Lord Zhenbei.

235
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,760
Don't say it.

236
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
Don't say it!

237
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
From now on, there is
no more Lord Zhenbei in this world.

238
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,080
Don't tell me what happened.

239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
I don't want to know.

240
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,320
Yue.

241
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,480
Let's go.

242
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,300
We'll head back to Changping Capital.

243
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,800
Let's deal with...

244
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,480
what needs to be done.

245
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,680
Those chosen by heaven
always face many trials.

246
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,360
Ordinary folks can only hope from afar.

247
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,760
If one lets go
of all their splendid robes,

248
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,080
peace and joy will come
every morning and night.
