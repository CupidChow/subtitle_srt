13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
I just don't get it.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,560
Since Yue Yong likes
drinking with women,

15
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,000
why don't you do it instead?

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Why make me wear this outfit?

17
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,960
It's to improve our chances of success.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,440
If Yue Yong doesn't fancy me,

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
we'd have to leave empty-handed.

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Besides, honestly,

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,880
judging from the way you look now,

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,560
I think you stand
a better chance than me.

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,880
Fine.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,560
Let's go.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,760
Well, wait a second.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
Why do I feel like

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,520
something's missing?

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,360
What...

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
What's missing?

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Hmm.

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
Oh, right.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,680
My goodness!

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,160
Even I'm a little smitten now!

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Let's go.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh, by the way,

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
be careful

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,280
and don't lose it.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,600
This might be
the last thing my mother left me.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Sure,

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,400
don't worry.

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Let's go.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,240
Darn it!

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,200
You think I'm someone to mess with, huh?

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,120
Shut up or I'll slice you all up!

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Zhao Laosan.

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,960
I don't care
what you've been up to out there.

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,320
But if you cause trouble
in Fallen Blossom Lane today,

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
don't blame me for being rude.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,880
Madam Yue.

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
Do you even hear yourself?

51
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
I've just had too much to drink.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
Yes, that's the case.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,240
Don't take it to heart.

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,120
So that must be Yue Yong.

55
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,400
What do we do?

56
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,600
Do we go toast her now or...

57
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,520
I've never seen you here before.

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Such a gorgeous lass, aren't you?

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Drink.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
One drink, one question.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Three drinks, three questions.

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,360
Miss, how did you know

63
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
I came to ask you questions?

64
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,960
Of course I knew.

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,440
You ladies have risked it
to come here to Fallen Blossom Lane.

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,080
If not for my help,

67
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,920
what else could you want?

68
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,720
So Qingming does look prettier than me
in women's clothing?

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,360
That's outrageous.

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,360
Why are you two tailing me

71
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,240
like this?

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm just out here trying to relax.

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,540
But with you two glued to me,

74
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,040
how on earth am I supposed to relax?

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
Get out! Wait outside!

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,680
Mm, got it.

77
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm going to ask my questions now.

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,080
That was the first question.

79
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,080
Well,

80
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,440
here comes the second one.

81
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,400
That counts as a question?

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,280
Yes.

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Exactly.

84
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,920
You'd better make the most
of this last chance.

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,320
Please tell me

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,600
any clue where Lu Qianqian,
the Princess of Changping, has gone.

87
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,640
That question

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,200
isn't a simple one.

89
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,000
Sir.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,880
Drink up.

91
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,800
Sir.

92
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,880
What is this place?

93
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,990
Aren't there supposed
to be beauties everywhere?

94
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Lass.

95
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,880
Your question really
caught me off guard.

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Help me with that

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,040
and I'll tell you the answer.

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Liar.

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,840
Sure,

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,640
Miss.

101
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,760
She's beautiful!

102
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
Wait, don't go!

103
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
Hey, pretty lady.

104
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,200
Come have a drink with me.

105
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,400
So shy, aren't you?

106
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,600
Looks like I'm lucky enough

107
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,720
to have bumped into you here.

108
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,440
Here.

109
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,160
Let me have a look.

110
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Well, well.

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Mmm.

112
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
Hua... Hua Qingming?

113
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:52,920
Let's go.

114
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,660
(Dongbi Academy)

115
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,920
Hua Qingming!

116
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,120
How dare

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,520
you!

118
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,040
Yue Qianxue?

119
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh, I see.

120
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,430
After making a scene
at the City Lord's Manor,

121
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,480
now you've kidnapped the Crown Prince!

122
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,000
You're utterly lawless!

123
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Just you wait!

124
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,040
Just wait.

125
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
When I get back
and tell my father

126
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,900
about all this, I'll make sure

127
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,000
you both get beheaded.

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,600
Well,

129
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
why don't you catch me?

130
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,360
Lu Buping.

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't you want to know

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,360
what the truth behind all this is?

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm not some trivial inspector.

134
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,960
Why would I bother myself with that?

135
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
My goodness.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
Lu Buping, oh, Lu Buping.

137
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
You're the Crown Prince.

138
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,660
Yet you visited the pleasure house

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,120
and got caught in the act.

140
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
Well,

141
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,680
do you think you're still able

142
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,040
to inherit the City Lord's title?

143
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,680
You!

144
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,000
That's nonsense!

145
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,760
Exactly.

146
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,360
All these years,

147
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,817
there've been many cases
of disinheriting the legitimate son

148
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:16,990
in favour of the illegitimate one.

149
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,360
Lu Buping.

150
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,200
With your idleness,

151
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,880
I don't think you get to inherit
the City Lord's seat.

152
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,920
You...

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Well,

154
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
don't you scare me.

155
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
You're both wanted fugitives right now.

156
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:34,920
And...

157
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:35,960
And...

158
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,280
And you're still trying to bluff me.

159
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
Lu Buping.

160
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm aware you're smart.

161
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,360
You may act all carefree and lazy
most of the time.

162
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,700
It's because your family
keeps you on a tight leash

163
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,600
that you haven't had the chance
to prove yourself.

164
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Well,

165
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,000
I couldn't have said it better myself.

166
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,800
As expected of Lord Zhenbei.

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
You're perceptive enough

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,280
to have figured my hidden brilliance.

169
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,680
Well, how can I help you?

170
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,200
We're investigating the truth
behind Lu Li's treason.

171
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,440
If you

172
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,720
help us crack this case,

173
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
well,

174
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,280
in the entire Changping Capital,

175
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,320
who'd dare

176
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,760
doubt

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
your capability?

178
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh my.

179
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,840
Minister Hua,
you care so much for the realm.

180
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
But I've got

181
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
quite a busy schedule.

182
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,560
Once it's done,

183
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,660
I'll teach you lightness skill.

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
What did you say?

185
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,040
Lightness skill.

186
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,200
The flying kind.

187
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,080
Well, you should've said so sooner.

188
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,520
Watch your step, Your Majesty.

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,160
Hongyue.

190
