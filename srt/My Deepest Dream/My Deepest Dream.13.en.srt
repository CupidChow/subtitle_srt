But I hate to get you involved in this.

You were attacked several times.

I suspect

the murderer is onto us,

27
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:59,965
we must be proactive.

28
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:00,885
After all,

29
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,365
we can use the information

I won't do anything.

39
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,765
I suspect that Su Wan is the culprit.

40
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,205
Hence, I'll keep a close eye on him

41
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:48,925
until his weak point is exposed

42
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:49,846

What about this?

Let's put on a show

pretending that we turn
against each other.

46
00:02:58,686 --> 00:02:59,765
Therefore, we can collaborate

47

to look for evidence.

00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:03,885
Is this your creation in writing?

But,

50
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:08,485
we shouldn't expose ourselves

51
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,086
in front of them.

52
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:11,566
I'll act tough against you

53
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,806
when they are around.

54
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,366
Some basic acts like

55
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,445
I'll throw tantrum at you and scold you.

Please don't be angry with me.

57
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:23,645
I won't mind it.

58
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:26,205

I'm sorry.

Since you know me well,

you must be aware

that I like Wu Yu.

you better stay out of my sight.

and be my mother's dog.

Stop pretending before me.

Ying, you've misunderstood me.

I like you very much.

You like me?

What do you like about me?

00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,525
I know

what you're plotting.

107
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,726
I want to marry into my house

108
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:23,405
not because you like me.

109
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:24,525
You can do anything

110
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,166
for money, you double-crosser!

111
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:30,686
Calm down.

00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:33,445
Drink the milk.

You're right.

I marry you just because of money.

I don't care if you like Wu Yu

117

nor do I mind

118
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,686
if you give me the cold shoulder.

119
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:06,405
I'll get the money

120

by fair means or foul.

121
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,285
Therefore, don't mess with me.

122
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:20,486
Let go of me.

123
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:22,566
Drink the milk. It's good for you.

124
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,205
Ouch! You're hurting me.

125
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,085
Let go of me.

126
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,006
Aren't you scared if I call for mother?

127
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:28,645
Mo...

128
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,246
Do you think

129
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,246
she will listen to you

130
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:40,765
or me?

131
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:53,325
Drink it.

132
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,205
It's good for your health.

133
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:27,765
Are you considering

134
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,965
whether to say hi to me?

135
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,246
Is Ying making a fuss again?

136
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:35,206
I know what you want to ask me.

137
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,525
But, we have nothing

138
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:40,045
to talk about.

139
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:43,326
You don't know about me.

140
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:44,606
I

141
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:46,246
am a neat guy.

142
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,006
Hence, I'll remove any dirt

143
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,966
that disturbs me.

144
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,006
Wu Yu.

145
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,925
No one can stop me to be with Ying.

146
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,045
Don't you find it strange?

147
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:24,006
What are you referring to?

148
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:25,446
The one

149
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:27,246
that threatened me to marry Ying
with the photo.

150
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,206
Su Wan likes Ying so much.

151
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:31,006
He wouldn't harm her.

152
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:32,846
This action contradicts his goal.

153
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,366
Speaking of his motive,
it's not possible.

154
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:39,246
However, what we saw in the time travel

155
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,765
and the traits directing us

156
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,045
to him.

157
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:43,925
Doesn't it mean

158
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,885
the murderer could be someone else
in this universe?

159
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,246
Different consequences will happen

160
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:49,126
in different universes.

161
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:51,126
Anyway,

162
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:52,366
we shall look into him first.

163
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,086
I've confirmed with Professor.

164
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,405
Su Wan stays in the apartment hotel
under the company.

165
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:57,765
Besides, a driver picks him up

166
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,045
at 8 a.m. every morning.

167
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:00,326
What about this?

168
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:02,086
From tomorrow onwards,
we split into two groups.

169
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:03,326
Zhuang Yu and I

170
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:04,405
tail him.

171
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,885
If he's the one who kidnapped Miao,

172
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,405
he surely will go to her.

173
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:09,805

174
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,246

175
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,165

178
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:19,805
I think

179
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,366
two of you will look into his office

180
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,486
and I'll tail him.

181
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,805
If he's the murderer,

182
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:26,925
he'll show the cloven hoof for sure.

I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

It's fine. I can understand.

Alright, no worries.

I keep a close eye on him.

He's so discreet.

Or maybe

227
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,006

Come clean.

It's a misunderstanding.

Anyhow, your practical experiment

294

has violated his privacy.

00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:12,765
But,

344
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,206
we're not sure if this can
be counted as evidence.

345
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:17,325
In the previous universe,

346
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,525
that was used by the murderer.

347
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:21,406
At least, this document

348
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,285
proves that Su Wan is accessible
to this substance.

349
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,726
Have you told Professor Chen about this?

350
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,246
I don't have the time to do so.

351
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:30,845
The moment we found this transfer order,

352
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:31,966
my dear friend

353
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:33,486
was trapped here.

354
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:34,966
Don't worry.

355
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,525
Wu Yu has gone to see Professor Chen.

356
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:38,966
Zhu, you indeed care about me the most.

357
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,085
Come on, let's grab some food.

358
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,100
(Potassium Cyanide Transfer Order
Customer: Feng's Group）

359
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,380
(Prepared by: Li Ping
Authorised by: Su Wan)

360
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:52,006
Professor.

361
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:53,605
What do you think about this?

362
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:55,845
It's my wife

363
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:57,325
handling the business.

364
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,605
I have no idea

365
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:00,765
about this transfer order.

366
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:02,646
However, potassium cyanide

367
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,325
is the raw material used by the factory.

368
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,045
Su Wan is the right-hand man of her,

369
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,646
it's reasonable for him
to deal with these documents.

370
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:11,646
But,

371
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,805
what if these goods aren't
used as raw materials?

372
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:15,166
By stealing a small amount of this,

373
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,486
he could make big chaos.

374
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:17,605
Besides, in the previous universe,

375
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,605
the murderer used this to kill.

376
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:20,966
I understand.

377
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:22,285
But,

378
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:25,045
this is not solid evidence.

379
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,045
At least we've confirmed

380
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,166
that he's accessible to

381
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,525
potassium cyanide.

382
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,446
As long as we continue to investigate,

383
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,845
we'll find the evidence.

384
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:13,765
We'll become better.

385
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,006
I hope so for Miao.

386
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,166
I really wish everything will be over
as fast as it can.

387
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,686
Wu Yu.

388
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,446
Why?

389
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:38,365
Why?

390
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,805
Didn't you agree to marry me?

391
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:43,525
Why?

392
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:46,686
I'm sorry, Ying.

393
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:48,646
Wu Yu.

394
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,605
We grew up together.

395
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:53,406
I love you.

396
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:57,686
But why can't you fathom
my feelings for you?

397
00:22:58,686 --> 00:22:59,886
Why would you choose

398
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:01,926
this vixen you knew
merely for half a year?

399
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:07,486
You...

400
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,926
Then, why did you agree

401
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,206
to marry me?

402
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:31,605
Answer me.

403
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:32,686
Ying.

404
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,325
Love can change because you want it
to go your way.

405
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,085
That's why you get Tan Jiao here.

406
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:46,166
When I'm about to attain happiness

407
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:50,006
and come closer to Wu Yu,

408
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,525
you break my bridge.

409
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,525
Are you my mother?

410
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:05,765
Why did you do this to me?

411
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:08,765
Ying.

412
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:11,966
Ms. Feng, she...

413
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:13,246
It's better to end this pain
before long.

414
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:14,966
She'll appreciate what I did
for her today.

415
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,006
Don't worry. I'll check on her.

416
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:34,285
Good evening, Miss Tan.

417
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:36,926
What

418
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:38,805
brings you here?

419
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:57,006
Tan Jiao.

420
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,006
Why did you leave yourself?

421
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:12,605
I told you I'd give you a ride.

422
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:24,686
You're up.

423
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:25,886
Let's eat breakfast.

424
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:27,686
I'll do it.

425
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,085
What's wrong with Ying?

426
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:30,886
It's late now. Is she still sleeping?

427
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:31,605
Lan.

428
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:33,565
Go and wake her up.

429
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,365
Sit, Wu Yu.

430
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,006
Have a seat, Wu Yu.

431
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:38,686
I guess she hasn't gotten over it.

432
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:39,125
It's for you.

433
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:40,605
Give me the bowl.

434
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,246
How mischievous of her.

435
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,646
She should take some time

436
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,006
to come around to this.

437
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:49,365
Are you reprimanding her?

438
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:50,525
You spoiled her.

439
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:51,486
Give me the bowl.

440
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:52,565
Well, I spoiled her.

441
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:53,206
Alright?

442
00:25:54,966 --> 00:25:56,486
Why isn't she here yet?

443
00:25:57,006 --> 00:25:57,966
I'll go and get her.

444
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:00,686
What a troublesome girl.

445
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,646
You may eat first.

446
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:03,565
She cares too much about her.

447
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:07,726
Where's Miss Tan?

448
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:09,325
I went to see her.

449
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:09,886
But she wasn't in the room.

450
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:10,765
I think she has gone back already.

451
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,045
Perhaps she doesn't want to upset Ying.

452
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:17,805
Professor.

453
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:19,406
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:21,085
It's fine.

455
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:24,246
I've put you in the spot.

456
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:27,686
I save Ying

457
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:29,646
because I want to rescue Miao.

458
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:32,085
It's bad that I haven't found

459
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:33,246
the evidence of the murderer.

460
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:35,926
She's so insensible.

461
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:38,006
What's happened?

462
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:41,646
She went out to take some fresh air.

463
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:44,486
She should've informed us though.

464
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:45,805
Leave her alone. We eat first.

465
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:47,966
Eat up while it's hot.

466
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,805
What's wrong with her?

467
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,045
Answer my call, please.

468
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,686
It's been around four to five hours.

469
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:04,686
Where would she go?

470
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,686
What's wrong with her?

471
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:07,886
She doesn't pick up my call.

472
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:09,966
She's gone too far.

473
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,006
Hey.

474
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:13,525
Doesn't she know
we'll be worried about her?

475
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,285
Why does she screen my call?

476
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,565
Will she be at someone's place?

477
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,726
(Tan Jiao, where are you now?)
Perhaps you can call her classmates.

478
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:23,125
I did.

479
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:24,845
I'll call the police then.

480
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:27,325
Don't make a fuss.

481
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,486
Perhaps she'll come back home

482
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:30,805
after she comes to her senses.

483
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:34,045
She's gone too far.

484
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,325
You spoiled her.

485
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:50,085
Hello, Zhuang Yu.

486
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:51,726
Is Tan Jiao with you?

487
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,285
She's left Professor's house.

488
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,166
You lost contact with her for some time?

489
00:27:58,365 --> 00:27:59,125
Mrs Chen.

490
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:00,686
Where's Su Wan?

491
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,765
He left Jinghai for a business trip.

492
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:03,365
What's wrong?

493
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:05,166
Zhuang Yu.

494
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:06,206
You try to look for Tan Jiao.

495
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,246
She went missing.

496
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,006
You must check this file carefully.

497
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:12,486
Alright.

498
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:15,125
Office Shen.

499
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:15,966
Get back to your work.

500
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:16,285
Sure.

501
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:18,486
What's the matter?

502
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,246
Tan Jiao went missing.

503
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:21,605
No rush. Take your time.

504
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:26,006
It's been a day.

505
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,365
We haven't received any messages
from her.

506
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,125
(Tan Jiao)
Will something happen to Ying?

507
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,246
What if something bad happens to her?

508
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:34,646
Chen.

509
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,325
Am I being too strict with her?

510
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:42,006
Well.

511
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:43,966
I've looked over all places,

512
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,486
but there's no sign of Zhu too.

513
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:49,605
What do we do then?

514
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,420
(Tan Jiao)

515
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:54,125
Mrs Chen.

516
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,605
Could you please think carefully about

517
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,966
whether Su Wan is still in Jinghai?

518
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:11,285
Is it Ying?

519
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:29,565
Stay still.

520
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:33,125
It's Miss Tan.

521
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:38,926
Don't move.

522
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:45,125
Chen Ruying is in my hand now.

523
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,085
If you want to keep her alive,

524
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,525
don't call the police.

525
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,406
Otherwise,

526
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,726
get ready to receive a corpse.

527
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:55,805
Wu Yu.

528
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:57,726
I've had enough of you!

529
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:03,325
Wu Yu.

530
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:04,886
What's going on now?

531
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:06,446
Mrs Chen.

532
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,006
Something is fishy about this.

533
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,125
But, please trust me.

534
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:10,886
Tan Jiao will never kidnap Ying.

535
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:12,845
What do you say about this video?

536
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:16,246
I guess someone has threatened Tan Jiao.

537
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:16,805
Ms. Feng.

538
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,006
You've seen that Wu Yu turned down
Chen Ruying.

539
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:20,605
It's impossible for Tan Jiao
to be jealous of her

540
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:21,805
and kidnap her, right?

541
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:23,686
Then...

542
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:24,406
Feng.

543
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:26,565
Calm down.

544
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:28,246
Sit down, everyone.

545
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,125
We'll figure it out together.

546
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:32,605
Sit down.

547
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:40,206
No.

548
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:43,045
I invited Tan Jiao here.

549
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:46,486
I refuse to believe
that she would kidnapped Ying.

550
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:48,845
But, why the spontaneous reaction

551
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:50,565
of the three of you

552
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,085
is to absolve her from her blame?

553
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,365
How are you sure

554
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:55,966
that she's not the culprit?

555
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:02,926
You've kept something from me.

556
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:05,886
Chen.

557
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,406
Our daughter is kidnapped by someone.

558
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:11,246
I have the right to know the truth.

559
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:20,646
Mrs Chen.

560
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:22,125
Please listen to me.

561
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:29,246
That's what has happened.

562
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:32,726
You said

563
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:35,166
you experienced time travel.

564
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,006
So, you suspect that Su Wan
kidnapped Miao

565
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,726
and threatened Tan Jiao and Ying.

566
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,646
I know you find this ridiculous.

567
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:46,926
But, it's all true.

568
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:48,926
Even you think it's ridiculous,

569
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,765
how would I believe this?

570
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:55,886
Wu Yu is my student.

571
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:56,765
I trust him.

572
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:59,166
But Su has been by my side
since he was young.

573
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:00,085
Ms. Feng.

574
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,406
You can't trust Su Wan completely

575
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:03,966
because he's your assistant.

576
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:05,646
In the previous universe,

577
00:32:05,646 --> 00:32:06,285
he's a suspect

578
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:07,646
in the murder of your family.

579
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:14,166
Fine.

580
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:16,525
Since every one of you suspected Su Wan,

581
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,886
I'll call him right now.

582
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,446
Let's ask him straightaway.

583
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:33,325
Look.

584
00:32:33,726 --> 00:32:34,966
I knew something was wrong with him.

585
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,646
We've filmed the video for you.

586
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:50,325
Can you release us now?

587
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:55,765
Listen up.

588
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:58,805
Don't tell me what to do.

589
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,125
Do you hear me?

590
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:03,206
Yes.

591
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:17,006
Erm...

592
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:19,166
Do you know who I am?

593
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:22,085
I'm a famous online writer.

594
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:24,446
I have one million followers on Weibo.

595
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:25,845
They're all loyal followers.

596
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:28,166
If you dare

597
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,125
to harm us,

598
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:31,565
they'll find your identity and
publish it on the website.

599
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:32,726
Shut up!

600
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,605
I'm sorry.

601
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,406
I'm sorry. Please don't get mad.

602
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,006
Please don't get mad.

603
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:40,325
It was...

604
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:43,845
It was a joke.

605
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:45,926
Actually, those are fake followers

606
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,525
I bought.

607
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:48,726
Don't be angry.

608
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:49,966
Please.

609
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:51,646
Calm down.

610
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:53,966
Please. Take it easy.

611
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:11,926
I'm taken aback.

612
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:18,966
Don't you think

613
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:20,565
you should apologise to me?

614
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:22,366
If you didn't ruin

615
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:23,725
my wedding,

616
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,366
how would I be chambered here

617
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:27,406
with you vixen?

618
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:32,245
I knew you wouldn't.

619
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,725
Are you writers

620
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:36,245
self-centred?

621
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:37,446
Tan Jiao.

622
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:39,446
It's fine for you to pretend
to be ignorant,

623
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,125
but you can't be really ignorant.

624
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:44,125
Wu Yu doesn't love you.

625
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:45,045
Think about this.

626
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:47,045
You're an online writer

627
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,366
who bought fake followers.

628
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:50,966
How would you have a common topic

629
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,245
with a doctoral student
like Wu Yu?

630
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:52,926
Why do you...

631
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:54,286
Can you stop?

632
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:56,045
You're annoying, Chen Ruying.

633
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:57,366
I'll be frank with you,

634
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,006
someone with such characters like you

635
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:00,245
won't survive more than three pages

636
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,886
in my novel.

637
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:02,685
I...

638
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,685
Quiet. Shut your mouth.

639
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,045
Also,

640
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,125
instead of criticising me,

641
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,446
you should recall

642
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:10,165
why you were kidnapped.

643
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,565
How would I know?

644
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,725
It's either he lusts for my money

645
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:15,926
or my beauty.

646
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:20,006
You're safe though.

647
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:21,886
Then,

648
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:25,565
do you still remember

649
00:35:26,245 --> 00:35:28,006
how did you get here?

650
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:29,525
Who kidnapped you?

651
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,725
I came out of the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

652
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:37,366
Who's that?

653
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:39,406
It seems to be Su Wan.

654
00:35:59,006 --> 00:35:59,725
I don't think so.

655
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,966
Judging that person's build,

656
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:04,926
it's not Su Wan.

657
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:08,486
Could it be his accomplice?

658
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:11,446
Are you asking me that?

659
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:13,165
Who knows.

660
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:20,886
What do we do now?

661
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,006
Think of something.

662
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:37,645
(Wu Yu.)

663
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:40,125
(I won't keep troubling you to save me.)

664
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,605
(This time, we'll fight evil together.)

665
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:48,565
If you want to keep her alive,

666
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:49,966
don't call the police.

667
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:50,846
Otherwise,

668
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:54,245
get ready to receive a corpse.

669
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:57,125
Geez, what do we do now?

670
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,366
Ms. Feng, Professor Chen.

671
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,245
We've set up a task force
to handle this.

672
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:01,725
But, we'll conduct the investigation
undercover

673
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:03,725
so as not to alert the enemy.

674
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:04,766
We'll do our best

675
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,085
to protect your daughter.

676
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:09,165
Officer Shen.

677
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:10,725
I think you should scrutinise someone

678
00:37:10,725 --> 00:37:11,966
as soon as possible.

679
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:13,846
Who's it?

680
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:14,926
Su Wan.

681
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,605
I suspect that he's the one
who kidnapped Tan Jiao and Ying

682
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:20,205
as well as the murderer
of serial killings in Jinghai City.

683
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:21,846
Why would you say this?

684
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,245
Do you have evidence?

685
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:24,366
Give me a second.

686
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:28,645
If we have evidence,

687
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:30,486
we would've reported him to the police.

688
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:32,725
Anyway, this person
is highly suspicious.

689
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:36,565
Officer Shen.

690
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020

691
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,260
(Authorised by: Su Wan)

692
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:44,045
Come out with me.

693
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:02,645
Wu Yu.

694
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:04,605
I have some questions for you.

695
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:07,085
Details of the Serial Killings
in Jinghai City

696
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:08,245
have never been made public.

697
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:10,125
