the people online were right about her,

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,040

Don't worry,

I will never look down on you.

69
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Look down on me?

70
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,760
Do you think it's my fault too?

71

No!

72
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:24,999
No.

73
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,119
It's not what I mean.

74
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,400
I mean,

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,119
you should learn to protect yourself.

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't wear those clothes.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Don't go to those places.

78

You don't need those.

79
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,999
I don't need your pity and sympathy.

80
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,600
It's the world's fault, not mine!

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Yes.

82
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,119
Jie, calm down.

83
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,439
It's their fault.

84
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,640
They shouldn't have
taken photos of you.

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,640
They shouldn't have
berated you online.

86
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,280
But Jie,

87
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,119
did it cross your mind

88
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,200
that

89
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,720
if you weren't wearing that outfit,

90
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,720
they wouldn't have
come after you.

91
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,999
If you didn't give those
bad guys a chance,

92
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,799
they couldn't have hurt you.

93
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,080
I was a fool to write you that letter

94
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,200
just to say goodbye.

95
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,640
I thought you were the only person alive

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,119
who understood me.

97
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,040
But, you're just like them.

98
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,679
Just like them?

99
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:18,720
No.

100
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,080
I am different.

101
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,999
I am different!

102
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,080
I love you more than
anyone in this world.

103
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,879
I love you.

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,799
No matter how rotten
or wretched you are,

105
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,119
I will always love you.

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,400
I don't need your perverted love.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,319
Stay away from me!

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,559
Your words only disgusted me even more.

109
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,119
What?

110
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,400
Say that again.

111
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,280
Say that again.

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,679
Say it again!

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,119
Listen to me.

114
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,119

Jie!

118
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,840
You killed all those girls

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,439
because you wouldn't face the truth!

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,600
No.

121
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,760
No.

122
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,319
No.

123
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,319
I was trying to save her.

124
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,400
I wanted to save her.

125
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,280
I wanted her to see it
from another perspective.

126
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,760
I didn't think

127
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,679
she'd fall off the building.

128
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,119
She's dead because of me.

129
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,799
She's dead because of me.

130
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,359
Everything has ended.

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,999
It ended a long time ago.

132
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,359
When Jie died,

133
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,879
my life ended.

134
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,799
Wu Yu!

Wu Yu!

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,319
Tan Jiao.

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,640
I know my love was wrong.

140
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,280
But I really loved Miao.

141
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,439
I really loved her!

142
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
My greatest mistake

143
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,760
was killing Miao.

144
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,200
Sorry.

145
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,600
Sorry.

146
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:15,720
Sorry.

147
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,040
Sorry!

148
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,919
I've made so many mistakes.

149
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,640
But, none of it has come to pass.

150
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,879
It's the future!

151
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,439
Tan Jiao.

152
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,479
I can still save them, right?

153
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,080
I swear

154
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:39,400
I will forget everything after I leave.

155
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,960
I won't hurt another soul.

156
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Please trust me.

157
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,840
Give me a second chance.

158
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,760
Are you alright?

159
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:44,959
Why?

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Why wouldn't you let Tan Jiao go?

161
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,400
If I can't have her,

162
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,839
no one shall get her.

163
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,480
This cycle is nonsense.

164
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,000
We're at the end.

165
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,559
Master Qizhu...

166

The dark cloud meets the bright moon.

167
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,079
Your fate is sealed.

168
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,000
In the end, why would he

169
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
go to such an extreme length?

170
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,240
Perhaps the one person he can never face

171
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,559
is himself.

172
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,319
But whatever the case is,

173
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,679
Miao is finally safe.

174
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,280
What do we do now?

175
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,480
The food has been destroyed.

176
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,160
Yeah.

177
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,799
What now?

178
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,319
There is fresh water on this island.

179
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,839
Fish is a good source of protein.

180
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,400
We can only have seafood
for the rest of our lives?

181
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,079
Come on!

182
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,520
Behave yourself.

183
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,559
It's already after dark.

184
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,839
We'll regroup at the camp.

185
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,120
We'll look around the island tomorrow.

186
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,760
We will get out of here.

187
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,480
Let's go.

188
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,400
So,

189
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,520
can this island change a person?

190
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,799
I had telescopic vision.

191
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,319
Yan Yuan could control birds.

192
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,240
Zhu Yutong

193
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,400
acquired the crystal that
could control the human mind.

194
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,599
The magnetic field here
must have been the cause.

195
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,400
But it's all over now.

196
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,839
I feel a little lamentable.

197
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,959
After so long,
the cycle is finally over.

198
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,400
However,

199
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,799
what will the future hold for us

200
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,079
after this ending?

201
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,120
Whatever it's like,

202
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,319
it's our future.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,719
Wu Yu!

204
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:21,599
Wu Yu!

205
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,959
I didn't say anything.

206
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:27,880
Wu Yu!

207
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,520
Wu Yu!

208
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,079
That's what I yelled when I was

209
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:35,959
looking in the forest.

210
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,040
It happened days ago.

211
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,360
Why can we hear it now?

212
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,280
The cause is probably

213
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,439
the temporal field.

214
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,240
Temporal field?

215
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,160
But it should be in the forest,

216
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,319
not the camp.

217
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Does it mean the field

218
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,599
not only makes us travel through time

219
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,240
but also causes
changes to the dimension?

220
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,719
Do you remember what Chen Xingjian said?

221
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,480
He was knocked out by the wave.

222
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
When he woke up,

223
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,599
he was already at the cave.

224
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,719
I thought that was odd as well.

225
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,400
We all woke up on the beach,

226
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,959
why was he at the cave?

227
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
There was no water there.

228
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,040
What if there was?

229
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,640
This island has a magnetic field

230
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,040
that warps time and space.

231
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,000
The inside and outside of this island

232
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,400
are on the same plane.

233
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,160
That was how the water appeared.

234
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,719
Which means it's a...

235
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,760
Mobius Strip.

236
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,040
In the three-dimensional world,

237
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,199
it's called the Klein Bottle.

238
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,240
I know how to get out.

239
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,000
That's the whole story.

240
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,520
You're saying

241
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,040
the island is a dimension

242
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
of Klein Bottle?

243
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,120
And this pond

244
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,199
is what connects this place
and the outside world?

245
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,520
That's one way to say it.

246
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,199
I'll draw a diagram for you.

247
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,000
The beach we're on

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,679
is at point A of the bottle.

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,799
Because of the warped
time and space,

250
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,040
we can't leave this place
from the beach.

251
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,799
The pond we're at

252
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,719
is at point B of the bottle.

253
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,839
If we pass through this body of water,

254
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,640
we can reach the outside world.

255
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,640
That is why Chen Xingjian woke up

256
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,280
at the cave.

257
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,679
That makes sense.

258
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,280
But still,

259
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,120
it's all a hypothesis.

260
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,120
It's a hypothesis,

261
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,319
but it's the best chance we have.

262
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:46,520
I'm going into the water.

263
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,919
No.

264
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,319
Wu Yu, that's too risky.

265
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,919
Talk him out of this.

266
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,280
Wu Yu.

267
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:55,839
Stay safe.

268
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,000
Talk him out of this.

269
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,040
Hold on.

270
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,599
I'm coming with you.

271
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,120
We'll have each other's backs.

272
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,439
Stay safe, both of you.

273
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,760
Who are you?

274
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,919
What is this place?

275
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,000
The gravity field

276
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:26,000
formed the Oppenheimer chasm.

277
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:31,919
Who are you?

278
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,799
I'm you from the future.

279
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,160
I've been waiting for you.

280
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,439
All of this,

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,199
what is going on?

282
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,240
The tragedy took place during
the perihelion of Mercury.

283
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,760
The gravitational redshift

284
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,919
warped time and space
to the maximum degree.

285
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,400
The island

286
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,040
that acts as a Klein Bottle

287
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,880
had a magnetic field
that underwent perturbed expansion.

288
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,040
That created a singularity in time.

289
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,040
That is why you're trapped here.

290
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,919
How did Tan Jiao and I

291
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,880
appear in different timelines?

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
You and Tan Jiao

293
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,719
were at the center of
the singularity expansion.

294
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,719
The convoluted series of events

295
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,040
is the result of
a series of coincidences.

296
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,760
It's not that complicated.

297
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,559
Hold on.

298
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,199
How is this not complicated?

299
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,079
But...

300
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,079
What are you talking about?

301
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,400
In laymen's terms,

302
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,679
(certain celestial phenomena)

303
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,040
(turned this island into a quantum state.)

304
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,679
(So, we are trapped here.)

305
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,199
(There have been events of)

306
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:39,439

(teleportation.)

308

(And due to some physical factors,)

309
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,640
(Tan Jiao and I)

310
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,480
(traveled through different timelines.)

311
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,799
Your explanation didn't
make it any simpler.

312
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,360
Whatever.

313
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,839
I just want to know

314
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,000
why there is another you standing here.

315
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,880
What about us?

316
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
How do we get out?

317
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,839
When the sun rises tomorrow,

318
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,439
there will be another event
of perihelion of Mercury.

319
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,520
The magnetic field on this island

320
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,839
will be altered once more.

321
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
The crystal cave

322
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,680
and this Oppenheimer chasm

323
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,079
will form a dimensional bridge.

324
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,359
You can leave via the quantum gap.

325
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,200
Either way,

326
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,200
we can leave tomorrow morning, right?

327
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,399
The quantum gap is not stable.

328
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,720
The calculation should be easy for you.

329
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,879
One more thing.

330
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,799
Every time the particle passes
through the quantum gap,

331
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,119
it drains the gap's energy.

332
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,879
The quantum gap can only let

333
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,319
a maximum of

334
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
six particles through.

335
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,119
Which means

336
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,119
only six of us

337
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,520
can pass through the quantum gap

338
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,280
and return to our world.

339
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,399
There are seven of us.

340
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,319
So,

341
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,319
that is why you are here.

342
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,559
Everyone who leaves

343
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,040
will lose their memories of this place.

344
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:09,440
We're back.

345
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,040
Wu Yu.

346
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,960
Wu Yu, how did it go?

347
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,399
- Well?
- Did you learn anything?

348
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,799
When the sun rises tomorrow,

349
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,200
we can leave.

350
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,520
That is great!

351
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,920
That's great.

352
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
How do we leave?

353
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,760
Just follow my lead.

354
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,559
Sure.

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,280
Hope is upon us.

356
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,520
You've been through a tough time.

357
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,480
Save your stamina.

358
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,879
Treat yourselves to a decent meal.

359
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Ying, Madam Feng,

360
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,680
could you get us

361
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,599
some freshwater?

362
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,319
Yes.

363
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,159
Let's go.

364
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,720
Tan Jiao.

365
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,280
Gather some firewood.

366
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,760
Sure.

367
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,599
Wu Yu.

368
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,559
Rui and I will head for the beach.

369
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,639
We'll try to catch some seafood.

370
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,520
Sure.

371
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,879
Rui, let's go.

372
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Zhou Wei, what are you doing?

373
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,960
Help us get some water.

374
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,319
Wu Yu and I just came back.

375
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,879
Let me take a break.

376
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,399
We'll raise a stove in the camp.

377
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,159
This is the last night.

378
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,319
We'll get working.

379
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:02,879
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

380
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,399
Wu Yu.

381
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,760
Can we

382
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,040
really get off this island tomorrow?

383
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,520
Don't worry.

384
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,040
This is our last night here.

385
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,920
We should celebrate.

386
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,920
Alright. See you around.

387
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
Was he telling the truth

388
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,879
just now?

389
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Only six of us get to leave tomorrow?

390
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,040
There is only so much energy.

391
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,920
With every person that passes through,

392
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,559
some energy will be drained.

393
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,680
After six people are through,

394
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,799
that exit might close.

395
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,399
I don't understand a word you're saying.

396
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,159
What do you mean it might close?

397
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:04,319
Who is going to stay on this island?

398
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,399
You can't be thinking about it.

399
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,799
You saw my future.

400
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,240
Who cares about the future?

401
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:20,799
You have a Ph.D.

402
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,480
Can't you figure something out?

403
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,799
I think this place is nice.

404
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll stay.

405
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,040
Give me a chance to be the hero.

406
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,760
Okay?

407
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,159
Only I can calculate the precise

408
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,559
departure time for everyone.

409
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,040
It has to be me who stays.

410
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,879
But...

411
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,440
Promise me something.

412
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,720
Do not tell anyone.

413
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,639
Not even Tan Jiao.

414
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,680
Do me another favor.

415
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,399

416
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,879

♪No matter♪

513
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,300
♪Which universe you're in♪

00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,540

515
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:38,740

516
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:49,780
♪From the beginning to wherever we'll be♪

517
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:03,359
When I carried the water
back to the camp,

518
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,760
you were all gone.

519
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,159
I was terrified.

520
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,559
This is our last night on the island.

521
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,879
I'd like to have something
to remember it by.

522
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,480
Are these

523
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,520
the crystals you found at the cave?

524
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,000
They are pretty.

525
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,639
We've lived through
the so many lifetimes

526
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,839
because of the energy they emit.

527
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,680
In the end,

528
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,520
they witness our happy ending.

529
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,520
By the way,

530
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,559
where did you get this?

531
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,960
I made it.

532
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,480
You made it?

533
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,119
I found the pearl when I was

534
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,040
digging for clams.

535
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,799
I brought it back for you.

536
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,480
That won't be enough.

537
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,879
When we go back to our world,

538
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,920
I want you to buy me an even bigger

539
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,879
diamond ring.

540
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
Of course.

541
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,399
I want an even merrier wedding too.

542
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,799
No, wait.

543
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,319
I want two weddings.

544
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,639
One at Dali,

545
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,079
and the other in Jinghai.

546
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,119
I'm going to invite all of

547
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,879
my friends.

548
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Whatever you say.

549
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,440
So...

550
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,639
After we get off the island,

551
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,200
what will you do?

552
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,040
I want

553
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,760
a house that belongs to us.

554
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,159
It can either be in Dali or Jinghai.

555
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,079
I want a garden.

556
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,319
I'm going to plant so many flowers.

557
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:14,639
By the way,

558
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,399
I want a dog.

559
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,839
When it wakes up every morning,

560
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,559
it'll come lick me my hand.

561
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,440
I'm going to put a collar on it,

562
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,680
one with a little bell.

563
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,119
When it starts

564
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,240
running around in the house,

565
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,920
we'll hear

566
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,240
the bell ringing.

567
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,200
At day,

568
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:42,839
I'll be a writer.

569
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,399
You'll give lessons at the university.

570
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,480
At night, we sit by the window pane.

571
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,000
You'll have me in your arms
as you do now.

572
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,040
We have each other in our arms.

573
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,079
We watch the moon together.

574
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You hum a tune softly to me.

575
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,200
Our home will become even merrier.

576
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
That's because...

577
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,960
The two of us

578
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,920
will have a child.

579
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,799
Then, they will have a child too.

580
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,839
Watch out.

581
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,679
There's nothing here.

582
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,759
Is there really going to be

583
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,239
a quantum gap?

584
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,719
It should show up.

585
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,719
This...

586
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,559
Is this the quantum gap?

587
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,279
Follow this route.

588
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
That should lead us to
the Oppenheimer chasm.

589
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,520
The exit should be up ahead.

590
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,159
Come with me.

591
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:07,880
Be careful.
