That I was doing experiment with him.

Are you two really doing experiment?

00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,095
What experiment?

33
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,174
Can I do it?

00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:43,975
Kids can't do this kind of experiment.

You...

00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,535
You really can't do such an experiment.

38
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:52,055
He can only do it with me.

39
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:58,414
Actually, we just wanted

40
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:00,375
to try and see if it'd produce some sort

if we can travel back to the past.

You ask him to tell you.

00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,055
I'll explain to her. You go.

51
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,734
I'd also like to do experiment.

Let's do experiment, okay?

54
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,815
The normal time travel

55
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:45,294
will have a pivot point.

56
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,294
In your case,

57
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,975
I have every reason to believe

58
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:49,975
that this cruise

59
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:51,815
is the pivot point.

60
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:53,414
Indeed.

61
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,454
Because when we returned to the boat,

62
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,095
the time was coherent.

63
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:00,294
Also, what had happened

64
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:01,694
remained unchanged.

65
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,134
At least the time line
when we were on the cruise

66
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,095
remained unchanged.

67
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:07,854
Then, why did

68
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,095
the subsequent things change?

69
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:10,535
That's because

70
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:11,935
of the things you did on the cruise.

71
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:14,375
If you want to figure out
the law of the time,

72
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,414
first of all, you have to figure out

73
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,655
why you'd travel back

74
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,254
on fourth of September

75
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:21,655
and on nineteenth of August?

76
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:24,575
Think about it carefully.

77
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,814
Is there any common characteristic
about the people

78
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:29,215
and things you met
during the two time travels of yours.

79
00:04:29,494 --> 00:04:31,054
Common characteristic?

80
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,695
On fourth of September,

81
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:38,174
I met Wu Yu again.

82
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:42,575
Then, I encountered Zhu family's case.

83
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,695
Then, I met Yan Yuan again.

84
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:49,895
This time, we met Chen Ruying.

85
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,135
Yan Yuan and Chen Ruying are
the people on the cruise.

86
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:02,494
Did you notice this?

87
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:05,174
You'll meet the people on board again
every time.

88
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:06,575
So the time travel

89
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,854
must be related to that cruise.

90
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:11,854
And then?

91
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,174
Then...

92
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:15,294
What do you mean by then?

93
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:16,734
There are very few clues.

94
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:17,414
Enough.

95
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,734
Just let it pass.

96
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:20,535
Let's talk

97
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:21,895
about another thing.

98
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:24,254
What is it?

99
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,535
The experiment you did just now.

100
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,455
How was it? How did it feel?

101
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:29,934
What do you mean?

102
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:31,254
I didn't feel anything.

103
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:32,695
No feelings at all.

104
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:33,934
How could it be?

105
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,655
I'm right here.

106
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:36,494
It didn't work.

107
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:37,734
We can't travel back at all.

108
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:39,814
I'm not asking you this.

109
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:44,374
I'm asking you
how it felt to kiss someone.

110
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,814
How did it feel to kiss someone?

111
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:57,095
No feelings at all.

112
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:58,655
Stop bluffing.

113
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:00,494
If I'm not mistaken,

114
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:01,934
it's your first kiss, isn't it?

115
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,215
I guess it is

116
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,135
in this time and space.

117
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:08,374
In this time and space?

118
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,374
Did you kiss
in the previous time and space?

119
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:16,015
As expected,
it comes the sensitive part.

120
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:16,934
Zhu,

121
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:18,934
you've become a lady.

122
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:20,054
Dear me.

123
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,374
As you saw

124
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:24,174
that junior of him wandering around you,

125
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:26,174
wouldn't it hurt your heart?

126
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,374
It didn't hurt my heart,
it made my head ache.

127
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:29,695
Believe me.

128
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,015
Whoever saw Chen Ruying

129
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,215
wandering around him,

130
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:33,455
they'd want to strangle her.

131
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,414
This has nothing to do with Wu Yu.

132
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:37,335
I just simply wanted to strangle her.

133
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,215
I didn't ask
about your feelings for her.

134
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,655
I meant

135
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:43,215
when you saw her being with Wu Yu.

136
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:44,734
The so-called heartbreak

137
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,575
is the feeling when you see

138
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:50,095
someone you care with another girl.

139
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,575
Didn't I write that, Sis?

140
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,414
I've got an IELTS course.

141
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:01,335
I'll get going.

142
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,814
Did I pass the IELTS exam

143
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,655
in the previous time and space?

144
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:10,174
You didn't.

145
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:11,294
Well...

146
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,095
Do you remember

147
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,374
what the exam content was?

148
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,455
Why would I remember your exam content?

149
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,215
You can't even remember
such an important thing.

150
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:18,414
It ticks me off.

151
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:43,374
Why are you staring at me?

152
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,655
You keep staring at me
without saying anything.

153
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:58,814
What's going on?

154
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:00,294
I forgive you.

155
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:02,854
I thought of arguing with you.

156
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:04,455
But I can't argue with a fool.

157
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:05,414
It'd only bring me down.

158
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,895
Then, you'd defeat me
with your experience.

159
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:08,335
I'm the legitimate girlfriend.

160
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,294
We're different.

161
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,934
I've got to act like one.

162
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,215
Excuse me.

163
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,054
I don't understand it.

164
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:18,095
What are you talking about?

165
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,775
What a coward.

166
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,414
I'll let you slide this time.

167
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:23,734
Just this once.

168
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:29,294
She's got such a strange character.

169
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:32,335
What are you doing?

170
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:33,975
You've gone too far.

171
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:34,575
What?

172
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,055
I haven't kissed Brother Yu,

173
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,854
I haven't even held his hand.

174
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:39,695
I treated you so well.

175
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:41,614
And I helped you figure out
that your best friend is a bad person.

176
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,575
How could you treat me like this?

177
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,935
My best friend is not a bad person.

178
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:46,134
Just let me go.

179
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:46,695
What is this about?

180
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:47,374
I don't want.

181
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:50,734
Let go.

182
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,300
(Wu Yu)

183
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:54,494
Wu Yu.

184
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:56,455
Brother Yu.

185
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:57,894
Give me your phone.

186
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:58,975
Brother, Tan Jiao bullies me.

187
00:08:58,975 --> 00:08:59,774
She wants to chase me out.

188
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,455
What's going on?

189
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:02,654
Give it to me.

190
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:03,575
Stop messing around.

191
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,534
Shen Shiyan texted me

192
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,494
and said he got the result
on what we asked him to look into.

193
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:08,774
He asked us to go to the police station.

194
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:14,854
The result is back.

195
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:16,055
The forensics in Jinghai

196
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,815
have tested

197
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:18,534
the deceased's hair
that they preserved that time.

198
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,534
And they found cyanide
on the hair follicles of Professor Chen

199
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:22,894
(Contain Potassium Cyanide)
and Madam Feng.

200
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,614
So my parents' death was not
an accident.

201
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:27,654
It was Su Wan's doing.

202
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,014
But based on the investigation,

203
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:30,774
the driver's death cause
wasn't poisoning

204
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,734
but by a blow to the head.

205
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:34,695
It must be Su Wan's doing.

206
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:36,494
There's one more thing.

207
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,534
We've found the car

208
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:39,534
that nearly hit you.

209
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,894
But the car has been abandoned.

210
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:44,295
I guess the guy has noticed something.

211
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:45,335
What about the car owner?

212
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:46,534
The car plate was forged.

213
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,614
Besides, the car was retrofitted
many times.

214
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:51,254
It's hard to find the first car owner.

215
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,254
I think you can start with the evidence

216
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:55,854
of the Jinghai Cyanide Serial Killing.

217
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:57,215
Maybe it can help you find out

218
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,654
the relevant information about the car.

219
00:09:58,894 --> 00:09:59,534
Yes.

220
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:00,654
We thought so.

221
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,734
So we've checked the footage
when it happened,

222
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:03,854
we found that this car

223
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,854
appeared at the scene
where the two female bodies

224
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:06,774
were dumped.

225
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:09,415
Which means

226
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:11,854
these two cases are related to Su Wan.

227
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,534
It seems to be the case for now.

228
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:15,575
We've sent more police forces over
to conduct a comprehensive seatch.

229
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,374
We'll find out Su Wan's whereabouts
as soon as possible.

230
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,975
(Qizhu Spicy and Fragrant)
Coming.

231
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:28,455
Here you go.

232
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,415
- Aunt, let me do it.
- Be careful.

233
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:30,014
Don't burn yourself.

234
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:30,774
It's alright.

235
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:34,774
You bring new friends over
for dinner again.

236
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,335
Welcome.

237
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:37,455
But this young man,

238
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,175
it seems to be your second visit here.

239
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,614
We were in a rush
during your first visit.

240
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:42,575
I didn't get to ask your name.

241
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:43,854
Hello, Aunt.

242
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:44,654
I'm Wu Yu.

243
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:47,734
What a special name.

244
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:49,494
Take a seat. Don't be so formal.

245
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,534
Have a seat.

246
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:51,654
Well.

247
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,335
What do you do for living?

248
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:54,534
I'm doing a PhD.

249
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,134
You're doing a PhD?

250
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:57,014
A PhD?

251
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,134
Oh my god, what a talented man.

252
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:00,734
You're a talent.

253
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:02,774
You know what?

254
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:05,415
Nowadays, a PhD is way too popular.

255
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:06,175
Every company wants you.

256
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,654
Mum, mum.

257
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:09,254
Well.

258
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:10,654
We came here

259
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,654
to talk about something important.

260
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:13,614
You...

261
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,614
You go and serve the other customers.

262
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:16,374
Go on with your work, okay?

263
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:17,134
Geez, this kid.

264
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,215
There's no other customers.
It's just you guys.

265
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,494
Which company

266
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:22,254
do you plan to choose?

267
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:23,374
Mum.

268
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:23,894
That's good.

269
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,614
We've got something to talk about.

270
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:28,734
Fine.

271
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:29,975
Geez.

272
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:32,774
Well, have a good conversation.

273
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:33,815
Enjoy the food.

274
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:43,774
I know what you're worried about.

275
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:47,295
But in the previous time and space,

276
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,614
things have turned out differently
for Wu Miao.

277
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,335
So we still have hope.

278
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:53,575
Besides, we've found the suspect.

279
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,175
I believe we'll get the result soon.

280
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:57,614
I'm thinking

281
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:01,494
that my master
and his wife were poisoned

282
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,695
but their driver was smitten.

283
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,335
Smitten?

284
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,175
Do you think it's possible

285
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,575
that when Su Wan murdered them,

286
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,254
the driver actually was not
at the scene?

287
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,534
When the driver returned,

288
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,254
he happened to see
Su Wan murdering them,

289
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,935
that's why he was smitten.

290
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:21,654
Then, Su Wan burnt the place down.

291
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,215
To make it look like a fire scene.

292
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:26,654
Do you think it's possible?

293
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,534
Judging from the current evidence,

294
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,374
it's a reasonable guess.

295
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:31,534
Right?

296
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,614
I finally understand

297
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:38,175
that everything was planned by Su Wan.

298
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,455
It must be him.

299
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:41,254
Rest assured.

300
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,175
We'll soon be able to capture him.

301
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:44,575
And you.

302
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,575
It's you who seduces Brother Yu.

303
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:50,215
Ying.

304
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:52,935
Your best friend must've stolen

305
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,975
the man you love, Shen Shiyan.

306
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:56,415
Chen Ruying, are you crazy?

307
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,494
I'm not crazy.

308
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:59,014
You're the crazy ones.

309
00:12:59,014 --> 00:12:59,654
You...

310
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:11,295
No way, what's going on?

311
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,695
You only had one drink.

312
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:13,534
And you're drunk.

313
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:20,534
Come here.

314
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:21,854
What's wrong?

315
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,014
Zhu,

316
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:28,614
well, actually, Staid Shen and I...

317
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:34,854
Firstly,

318
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:36,575
there's nothing

319
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,335
between me and Staid Shen.

320
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:41,374
Secondly,

321
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:44,415
anyone can court him if they like.

322
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:45,935
I have no problem with that.

323
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:48,654
Well, I actually...

324
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:50,935
Okay, stop explaining.

325
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,175
In fact...

326
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,055
What's wrong?

327
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,055
In fact, both of you were a couple

328
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,695
in the previous time and space.

329
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:03,455
Hence, in this time and space,

330
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:04,854
you should go for it.

331
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:05,975
In the previous time and space?

332
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,175
How could you give me a spoiler?

333
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:08,014
This is cheating.

334
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:08,894
I told you this in advance.

335
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:09,614
Watch your step.

336
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:12,614
You shouldn't have drunk so much
as you're a lightweight.

337
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:13,854
You're so drunk.

338
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:16,374
Zhuang Yu,

339
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,374
why are you blushing?

340
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:18,295
You drank too much too?

341
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:20,415
I didn't.

342
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:21,374
I'll get going.

343
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:22,774
Bye bye.

344
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:25,415
Stand still.

345
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:26,335
Come, Aunt, let me do it.

346
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:28,534
Okay, you guys help her out.

347
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,415
We'll go back first, Mum.

348
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,494
Stay safe.

349
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,175
Rest assured.

350
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:32,815
See you, Mum.

351
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:33,335
See you.

352
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:34,614
She's not your mum. Let's go.

353
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:35,695
Oh my god.

354
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:37,894
She became like this
after drinking a little.

355
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,695
Easy. Slow down.

356
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:45,374
This junior of yours

357
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,095
is quite troublesome.

358
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:48,894
Watch out. Be careful.

359
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,134
I need to apologise to you.

360
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,254
I was just spitballing.

361
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:55,415
Don't mind about it.

362
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:57,534
Whether it's this time
or the previous time,

363
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:59,654
I've made you unhappy.

364
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:02,575
Sorry.

365
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,055
I really am not upset.

366
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,175
Besides, in this time and space,

367
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,774
I'm really happy that you could come

368
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:13,175
and find me in Dali.

369
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,215
Okay, you should go back.

370
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:21,335
I'll help her inside.

371
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,254
- Tan Jiao.
- Let's go.

372
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:24,975
We've run into

373
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,734
many horrible things on this return.

374
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,175
But it's really good

375
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:32,295
to meet you.

376
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:34,575
Me too.

377
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,014
Me too.

378
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:42,175
What do you mean?

379
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:42,935
Let's go home.

380
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,175
I'm taking her inside.

381
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,055
Let's go.

382
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:45,935
Let's go home.

383
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:50,774
We're home.

384
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:54,374
Easy.

385
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:57,734
Let's go.

386
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,014
Hang on.

387
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:01,935
Come.

388
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:03,335
Sit on the couch.

389
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:04,854
Stop turning around.

390
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,374
You're so heavy, Chen Ruying.

391
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:29,695
Mum.

392
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:31,854
I miss you so much.

393
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,494
Chen Ruying, stop crying.

394
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:05,254
(I'm very satisfied
with the young man today.)

395
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:06,494
(Mum)
(You can do this.)

396
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:16,215
(I'm not the kind of person
who will interfere with you.)

397
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:18,455
(You're free to develop
the relationship.)

398
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:21,375
(I'll wait for your good news.)

399
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:28,895
(Tan Jiao)
(I'm going to bed. Good night.)

400
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,660
(The Writer Qizhu: The cloud and the moon.)

401
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,940
(You've worked hard. Here you go again.
Love you, muacks. Master Qizhu, I love you.)

402
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,500
(Love you, Master is the best.)

403
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,534
Who is it?

404
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,020
(If you want to know
the truth of the tragedy,)

405

(come to Dongbei Road Number 22 alone,
I'll wait for you.)

406
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:27,415
You occupy the washroom
early in the morning.

407
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:29,774
Hurry up, Chen Ruying.

408
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:41,334
Who is it?

409
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,014
Coming.

410
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:45,175
Coming.

411
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:48,294
Who...

412
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:53,935
Hang... Hang on.

413
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:01,975
Well,

414
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:03,895
why are you here?

415
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:05,094
Your breakfast.

416
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,574
You must've thought

417
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,014
it was tough for me to take care

418
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:11,935
of your junior last night.

419
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,655
So you're here to treat me.

420
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:14,975
Yes.

421
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:16,175
Besides,

422
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,175
I like it no matter how you look.

423
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:27,254
Chen Ruying, it's time for breakfast.

424
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:28,175
Hurry up.

425
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,455
She's so slow.

426
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:34,814
Ying.

427
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:38,094
Why isn't she coming out?

428
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:38,935
Chen Ruying,

429
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:40,175
it's breakfast time.

430
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:47,895
Breakfast is here, hurry up.

431
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:50,494
Chen Ruying.

432
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:51,774
I'm opening the door.

433
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:57,175
She's not in here.

434
00:22:58,574 --> 00:22:59,415
Chen Ruying.

435
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:00,975
Ying.

436
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:02,814
Chen Ruying.

437
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:06,695
She's gone.

438
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:07,534
Calm down.

439
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:08,655
Maybe she went out to buy something.

440
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,814
But...

441
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:14,135
But her bag is here.

(This is not your fault.)

450
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,254
Why don't you wait for me here?

451
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:12,455
No.

452
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:13,655
I've got to be with you.

453
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:18,415
Okay.

454
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,375
Then, you stand behind me.

455
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:20,455
Be careful.

456
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:08,494
Wu Yu, watch out!

457
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:14,734
Are you alright?

458
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:15,895
I'm fine.

459
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:17,975
Call the police.

460
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:18,615
Okay.

461
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:34,094
Be careful.

462
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:02,615
Why is there blood?

463
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:17,494
Don't be afraid.

464
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:18,935
It's just reddish dye.

465
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,014
Wu Yu, Wu Yu.

466
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,094
It seems to be a person over there.

467
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:15,855
Chen...

468
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,655
- Chen Ruying.
- Ying?

469
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:20,175
Ying.

470
00:27:20,615 --> 00:27:21,294
- Ying.
- Chen Ruying.

471
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,215
Ying.

472
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:23,334
Ying.

473
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:25,375
How is she?

474
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,375
She fainted.

475
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:34,774
Don't worry.

476
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:36,334
We've examined her.

477
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,294
She should be fine.

478
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:38,375
She's awake now.

479
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:39,615
Thank you, Doctor.

480
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:40,215
You're welcome.

481
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:43,615
Brother Yu,

482
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:45,415
I thought

483
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:47,895
I can never see you again.

484
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,254
We grew up together.

485
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,814
Don't ever leave me, okay?

486
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:26,574
Brother Yu.

487
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:28,734
To me,

488
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:31,734
you're like Miao.

489
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:33,975
Both of you are my sisters.

490
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,455
You only see me as a sister?

491
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:39,574
But Brother Yu,

492
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:40,655
I like you.

493
00:28:40,774 --> 00:28:43,094
It's not like brother and sister.

494
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:48,094
For the past few days,

495
00:28:49,054 --> 00:28:50,734
you must've been annoyed by me.

496
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:54,375
I know I've got a bad temper.

497
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:58,175
I don't care if you're busy

498
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,135
and I don't care if you really hate me,

499
00:29:02,494 --> 00:29:03,975
I always pester you.

500
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:08,534
Actually, it's to draw your attention.

501
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:10,334
I know, Ying.

502
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:13,455
But in the future,

503
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,534
I'm sure you'll find the guy
that belongs to you.

504
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:18,774

With me around, there's always a family.

514

Master and his wife gave me
a second family.

So no matter what happens,

That day, I went there
in accordance with the note.

But I was electrocuted

Maybe I was too scared that day.

I thought he would kill me.

more than I did.

I'm more worried about you.

I'm afraid that you'd get hurt.

Su Wan didn't see you

572

so he electrocuted Ying

573

and hid in the shadows to wait for you.
