00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:12,960
You didn't eat anything yesterday

174
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,680
so I got some ingredients
from the fridge

175
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,001
and wanted to make you some food.

176
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,041
But you slept a whole night

177
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,200
on the sofa.

178
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm sure you didn't sleep well.

179
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:23,920
I'm fine.

180
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:25,440
You shouldn't get busy.

181
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,641
Here.

182
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,560
Let me do it.

183
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Go out and rest.

184
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,001
Just let me do it.

185
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,361
Can you cook?

186
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't worry.

187
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,361
I make delicious meals.

188
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Just go outside

189
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,881
and wait for me to cook you

190
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:39,840
a nutritious breakfast.

191
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,041
Wait for me.

192
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:16,840
Why...

193
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:19,881
Why are you staring at me?

194
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,320
I get nervous

195
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,080
when you stare at me

196
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,840
and it affects my cooking.

197
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,600
I'll sit over there then.

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,281
But...

199
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:31,080
Go upstairs.

200
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,361
Go upstairs and wait.

201
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:35,200
There are many books upstairs.

202
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,041
You can look around

203
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,320
the second floor.

204
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,440
Just go upstairs and wait.

This is a book written by Master Qizhu.

208
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,361

00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,920
Why did you come downstairs?

212
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
It's better if I do it.

213
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:30,680
Well...

214
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,680
It's a bit messy.

215
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,680
Let me put the apron on you.

216
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:44,840
Thank you.

217
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:06,800
It's done.

00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,680
Go and wait for me in the living room.

00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,001
Sure.

220
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,161
I'll wash the dishes after eating.

221
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,680
I'll wash the dishes.

222
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:40,401
Amazing.

223
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,281

Sure.

225
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,001
The soup is delicious.

226
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,440
I didn't expect a science student

227
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,521
to know how to cook.

228
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,481
Also, they are delicious.

229
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:03,761
Did you

230
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,640
usually cook for your family
in the past?

231
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,880
I don't mean that.

232
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,281
I'm just praising you
for being considerate

233
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,640
and good at taking care of people.

234
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:27,961
Sorry.

235
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

236
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,721
There's no need to be so cautious.

237
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,001
Dear.

238
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:45,880
I was in IELTS class

239
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,681
and I made...

240
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,120
A huge discovery.

241
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,521
Good morning.

242
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:53,041
Hi.

243
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,840
Sorry for disturbing you two.

244
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,640
It's not what you think.

245
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,721
What was I thinking?

246
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,681
He was afraid of
the black bird appearing again

247
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,441
so he came to take care of me.

248
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:26,400
I can see that.

249
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
He is taking care of you thoroughly.

250
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:31,681
All right.

251
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:32,441
I've told you...

252
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm here to tell you

253
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,521
about some important clues.

254
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,241
What?

255
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:37,320
I went to the IELTS class.

256
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,721
What?

257
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:40,080
I realised Zhu Jirui

258
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
also applied to
my overseas study agency.

259
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:43,001
Look.

260
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,080
(Name, Zhu Jirui)

261
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,880
(Name, Zhu Jirui)
It's her, right?

00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:47,880
Wu Yu.

263
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:48,921
Wu Yu!

Come and take a look at this.

265
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:53,880
What's wrong?

266
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:55,521

(Contact, Zhu Fengxian)
This is Zhu Zihan's grandfather's name.

270
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:10,320
I found out

271
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,721
this old man has three children.

272
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:12,681
The eldest son

273
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,160
is Zhu Zihan's father.

274
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,560
(Zhu Zhongling)
His name is Zhu Zhongling.

275
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,320
The second son is Zhu Shuyun.

276
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,921
The youngest daughter

277
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:23,961
is Zhu Jirui.

278
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,614
Look.

279
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,600

(Bo, Zhong, Shu)

281
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,721
The names of the Zhu family

282
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:37,241
are named according to Bo, Zhong, Shu and Ji.

283
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:40,961
(Zhong)
But why is Zhong in the eldest son's name?

284
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,820
There should be another child with the name Bo in it.

285
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,640
(Zhu Bo X)
There should be another child with the name Bo in it.

286
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,041
It's true.

287
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,441
I've finished providing

288
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,840
my important clue.

289
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,320
I still need to do my revision.

290
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,800
Seriously.

291
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,921
I see you two being lovey-dovey.

292
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:01,441
I'll send her off.

293
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,320
I still have to do my revision.

294
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,481
Why is my life such a torture?

295
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,880
Bye.

296
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,281
Be careful.

297
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:07,400
Bye.

298
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:13,441
What's wrong?

299
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,721
I saw Zhu Jirui's name

300
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:18,840
on Diamond Star's passenger list.

301
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,600
I was wondering

302
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,041
where I saw her before.

303
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
Why don't we ask her

304
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:42,761
to see if she remembers

305
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,001
anything that happened on the cruise?

306
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:45,681
Sure.

307
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:46,800
Let's go and visit the Zhu family.

308
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,441
No one's inside.

309
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Let's go back to the car for now.

310
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,400
They have a big family.

311
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:13,521
Why isn't anyone home?

312
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,521
Here.

313
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,521
Thank you.

314
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,241
I didn't expect you

315
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,560
to be quite the gentleman.

316
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
You wrote in your novel

317
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,840
saying a guy should
open a bottle for a girl.

318
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,041
Master Qizhu's book
is better than expected.

319
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,681
When did you find out?

320
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:05,681
The name of
your house's hot pot shop is nice.

321
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,560
My mother came up with the name.

322
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,441
Not me.

323
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:11,761
How would I name it
Qizhu's Spice and Fragrance?

324
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Right?

325
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:20,281
There's someone in the house.

326
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,721
I saw someone on the first floor.

327
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,360
Seriously.

328
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,560
This superpower of yours

329
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,080
is quite convenient.

330
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,921
Why aren't they opening the door?

331
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,400
All of them look serious.

332
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,600
They seem to be discussing something.

333
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,840
Mr. Zhu has a paper in his hand.

334
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,721
I can't see the content.

335
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,961
It is blocked.

336
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,560
What should we do now?

337
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Should we call the police?

338
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,961
Let's wait for a while.

339
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,600
(Bring 500,000 yuan in cash)

341
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,600
(Zhu Zihan will die if one of you fail to appear.)
have to bring 500,000 yuan in cash

342
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,800
to the warehouse at West Mountain Peak
to rescue Zhu Zihan.

343
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,560
Zhu Zihan will die
if one of you fails to appear.

344
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,281
Don't call the police.

345
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,961
What's the meaning of this?

346
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,600
Zihan.

347
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,160
I think they want money.

348
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Just give them money.

349
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
I just have a grandson.

350
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,041
I want him back safely.

351
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,640
But why do they want seven of us?

352
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,481
Dad. Mom.

353
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,681
Both of us.

354
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,880
You, Xiaomei and Yan Yuan

355
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,281
are seven people altogether.

356
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:28,481
Xiaomei and Yan Yuan's issues
haven't been settled yet.

357
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:29,761
Why are they counting them?

358
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:30,160
Seriously.

359
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,080
That's enough.

360
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,761
Stop talking.

361
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:34,961
If they just want money,

362
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,160
why do all of us have to be there?

363
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,721
So, I think this is
most probably a trap.

364
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,360
No. I have to call the police.

365
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,360
That's more reliable.

366
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:44,521
You can't do that!

367
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,001
If the kidnappers find out,

368
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:47,080
Zihan will die.

369
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,041
Still, we can't go there

370
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:48,921
when we know it's a trap.

371
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,560
I'm not going.

372
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,041
Brother.

373
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:53,840
If you want to stop me
from calling the police,

374
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,320
I think you can go there on your own.

375
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:57,521
After all, Zihan is your child.

376
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,721
How can you say that?

377
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,560
Let me tell you.

378
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:02,521
You have to go

379
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,640
no matter what.

380
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:04,160
Come!

381
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,761
Let go!

382
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,400
Come with me!

383
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:15,281
Hello.

384
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:22,481
Dad! Mom!

385
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:23,560
Save me!

386
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:24,761
Zihan!

387
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,160
If you hesitate,

388
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,800
just be prepared to see him dead.

389
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,921
Who are you?

390
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,560
You will know when you come here.

391
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:34,041
Hey!

392
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,880
Dad.

393
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,080
What should we do now?

394
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:40,600
Go.

395
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:41,721
All of us will go.

396
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,120
We have so many people.

397
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,201
I don't believe

398
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,441
they can do anything to us.

399
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,721
We'll act
according to the circumstances.

400
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:01,521
They have come out.

401
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,921
Where are they going?

402
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,360
Let's follow them.

403
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,400
All right.

404
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,241
- Zihan!
- Han!

405
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,201
Zihan!

406
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,320
Zihan!

407
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:31,560
Zihan!

408
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,481
Han!

409
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:35,840
Grandpa is here to save you!

410
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,800
Stop shouting!

411
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,961
We have been fooled!

412
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:39,521
Shut up!

413
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:40,761
That is my son.

414
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:42,120
That is your son.

415
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
How is it our business?

416
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:44,360
Enough!

417
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:46,320
Dad.

418
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:48,281
It's a dead end.

419
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,241
Go upstairs.

420
00:26:57,921 --> 00:26:59,001
Be careful.

421
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:00,400
This...

422
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:01,880
Something's wrong with this place.

423
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,320
I'm not going upstairs.

424
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,120
I told you

425
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,640
there's no one upstairs.

426
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,681
Why won't you listen to me?

427
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,120
Why are you so brave?

428
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:11,721
That's...

429
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,400
I can't believe it.

430
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:25,360
What's this smell?

431
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,281
It's so weird.

432
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,840
Rui.

433
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Something's wrong.

434
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:34,721
Brother!

435
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,640
Dad!

436
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:12,160
Wu Yu.

437
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:14,400
Why is it so quiet here?

438
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,921
Quiet.

439
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:55,961
Rui.

440
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,320
Rui.

441
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,241
Is everyone all right?

442
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,041
Sister-in-law.

443
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:07,320
Mom.

444
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,441
Son.

445
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,479
Zihan!

446
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,640
Zihan!

447
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:18,400
What did you do to him?

448
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,080
Don't be afraid.

449
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,041
He is just sleeping.

450
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,481
I let him take some medicine

451
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:29,241
because he was too noisy.

452
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,840
What do you want?

453
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,160
We brought the money

454
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,521
and we didn't call the police.

455
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,360
Old man.

456
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,360
I don't want money,

457
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:40,041
I

458
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,120
just want his life.

459
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:45,721
Zihan!

460
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,160
Point your gun away from him!

461
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:48,521
Calm down.

462
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,400
Let's talk.

463
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,120
Zihan!

464
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,481
Hello, Shen Shiyan.

465
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,560
Something is happening here.

466
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Put down the gun!

467
00:29:54,681 --> 00:29:55,880
Shut up!

468
00:29:58,281 --> 00:29:59,600
Shut up, all of you!

469
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,441
You don't want to see him dead, right?

470
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
There's a way.

471
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,320
Choose one person among you

472
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,840
and switch with him.

473
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,761
It's called
exchanging a life for another.

474
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:18,721
How is that?

475
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,201
I want to kill someone
from the Zhu family.

476
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,041
What kind of grudge
do you have against us?

477
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,921
Why do you want to kill us?

478
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,600
Come!

479
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:36,721
Old man.

480
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:38,721
You do it.

481
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,800
Choose a person among them.

482
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,961
Who should you choose?

483
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:49,761
You?

484
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,320
No!

485
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:53,721
What about you?

486
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,681
You?

487
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:01,961
Or you?

488
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,961
Hurry up!

489
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,241
Choose someone!

490
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,201
Pick someone among them

491
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,281
to exchange for your grandson!

492
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:12,281
Choose!

493
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:12,961
Dad,

494
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,961
you mustn't choose me.

495
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:15,761
I'm your beloved son.

496
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:16,640
Dad!

497
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:18,721
Zihan is your grandson!

498
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,441
Dad!

499
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:20,800
After I married into this family,

500
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm a part of the Zhu family.

501
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,001
All of you...

502
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,560
What are you trying to say?

503
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,961
All of you...

504
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,560
All of you want to choose her?

505
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,961
No!

506
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,080
- Yes.
- No!

507
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Choose her!

508
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,521
Then, let us go.

509
00:31:58,521 --> 00:31:59,560
Shut up!

510
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,681
I want someone from the Zhu family!

511
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,120
Someone from the Zhu family!

512
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,800
Is Zhu her surname?

513
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,441
Are you trying to torture me

514
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,481
by killing my family?

515
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,360
Family?

516
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:15,721
How dare you mention family.

517
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:19,080
You are the one who harmed your family.

518
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,840
Zhu Chunsheng.

519
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:29,080
Do you still remember

520
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:33,080
Zhu Boyan, who you abandoned back then?

521
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,080
Who are you?

522
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,961
I am the person

523
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:39,120
who you've abandoned in the park

524
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,400
and left for good, Zhu Boyan.

525
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:43,600
The names of the Zhu family

526
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,041
are named according to Bo, Zhong, Shu and Ji.
[*Numbers in sequence of brothers]

527
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:46,840
(Bo, Zhong, Shu, Ji)

528
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,840
But why is Zhong
in the eldest son's name?

529
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:53,241
There should be
another child with the name Bo in it.

530
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:56,921
That's impossible!

531
00:32:57,521 --> 00:32:59,241
Yanyan died when he was five years old!

532
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,681
Let me go!

533
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,001
Let me go!

534
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,080
Let go!

535
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,800
Don't move!

536
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:07,120
Don't move!

537
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,241
I remember Yanyan, of course.

538
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:10,961
My children.

539
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
Bo, Zhong, Shu and Ji.

540
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,880
I want them to remember

541
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:18,080
they had a brother called Zhu Boyan.

542
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:21,560
How dare you use Yanyan to frame me?

543
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:24,961
Liar.

544
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,840
Old liar!

545
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,320
When are you going to stop your act?

546
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,840
Help!

547
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,840
A fake gun?

548
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,961
Rui, be careful!

549
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,600
What should we do?

550
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,600
All of you should die.

551
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,521
Help!

552
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,841
All of you should die.

553
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:21,801
Everyone from the Zhu family should die!

554
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,080
Rui!

555
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,280
Rui, lower your head!

556
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,560
Help!

557
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
- Protect yourself.
- Wu Yu.

558
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,640
I'm going to rescue them.

559
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:35,680
But this place is too dangerous.

560
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,680
I'll go with you.

561
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,200
Help!

562
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,921
Wu Yu, hurry!

563
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,960
Tan Jiao!

564
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:44,560
Release them!

565
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,760
Over here.

566
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,001
Hurry!

567
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,001
Go down!

568
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,481
Leave this place!

569
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:56,841
Careful!

570
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,481
Yan Yuan, move the boxes.

571
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,680
Wu Yu, give that to me.

572
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
Move!

573
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,240
Back off!

574
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,760
Hurry!

575
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,881
What should we do?

576
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,001
Extinguish the fire!

577
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:48,521
Yes!

578
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:50,361
Are you all right?

579
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:50,921
Yes.

580
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,001
It's all over now.

581
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,120
Hurry.

582
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:02,921
Call an ambulance!

583
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:03,521
Yes!

584
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:10,200
Did I fall asleep?

585
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,140
(Dedicated To One's Duty)

586
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,481
You may leave.

587
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:20,001
Okay.

588
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,440
(Dedicated To One's Duty)

589
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:27,841
Shen Shiyan.

590
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,080
How is it?

591
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,921
The children have been rescued.

592
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,280
The kidnapper was only targeting
the Zhu family.

593
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,160
The other children were a distraction.

594
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,280
What about Zhu Boyan?

595
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,640
He is still in the hospital.

596
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,120
We can't ask him anything yet.

597
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:40,521
All right.

598
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:41,801
Both of you should go back and rest.

599
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,401
Didn't I ask you to run
when you're in danger?

600
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:58,080
Why did you rush in?

601
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,600
I didn't think about that.

602
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,361
I'm not blaming you.

603
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,200
I just don't want you

604
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,120
to face something like that again.

605
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,120
What are you doing?

606
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,600
Put me down. I can walk on my own.

607
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:24,401
You...

608
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,961
Put me down.

609
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:35,521
It's all thanks to you today.

610
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,481
You saved the Zhu family.

611
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:38,680
Right?

612
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:40,680
Am I amazing or what?

613
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:46,760
But you shouldn't do
something so dangerous in the future.

614
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,441
I know.

615
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,441
The kidnapper has been arrested anyway.

616
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:52,760
We probably

617
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,401
won't encounter any more
dangerous situations.

618
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,481
Who do you think

619
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:03,321
was telling the truth

620
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,120
between Zhu Boyan and Zhu Fengxian?

621
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:09,481
Zhu Boyan perhaps.

622
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:14,401
After what happened yesterday,

623
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,600
the people of the Zhu family

624
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,280
will never trust each other again.

625
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,401
Yes.

626
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,801
I wonder how long it takes

627
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,441
to heal this wound.

628
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Some wounds can be healed.

629
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,881
But some wounds

630
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,120
can never be healed forever.

631
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,280
We said

632
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,280
the person who was controlling the birds
was related to the cruise.

633
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:47,280
But I've investigated

634
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,481
and I don't think
Zhu Boyan was involved.

635
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:25,801
I heated a cup of warm milk for you.

636
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,521
Leave it here.

637
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,041
Did what happened today

638
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,441
make you remember Boyan?

639
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,921
Yes.

640
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,401
I think about him every day.

641
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,841
He was my first son.

642
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:53,401
I spent all my efforts on him.

643
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:56,080
But I didn't expect

644
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,361
this kidnapper

645
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,760
to use the late Yanyan

646
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,841
to frame me.

647
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,680
How would I be someone as he described?

648
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,441
