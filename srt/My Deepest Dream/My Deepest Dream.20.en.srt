He left a palm print.

Our guys have been watching him
since yesterday.

He wouldn't have the time to do that.

Regardless,

54
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
I hope the police can
extract this palm print,

and compare it with Chen Xingjian's.

62
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:35,672
didn't let you leave the house?

63
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,833
I will think about it.

64
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,232
I have to go. Wu Yu is here.

Don't spend too much time on your phone.

66

Let your eyes rest.

67
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:49,833
I can't go out.

68
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:52,193
What else can I do
other than looking at my phone?

69
00:06:58,472 --> 00:06:59,033
Wu Yu,

70
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,912
I want to talk to you about something.

71
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,992
Tonight,

72
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,073
can I just go out for two hours?

73
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,393
Just two.

74
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:12,953
No.

75
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:14,713

76

Wu Yu,

77
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,113
I really want to go to this concert.

78
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:18,833
I've been anticipating it
for six months.

79
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:20,193
How about this?

80
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,872
Why don't you and Master Qizhu
go with me?

81
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:24,792

84
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,112
You should focus on
what matters in your life.

85
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:34,552
I will go with you next time

86
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,033
when the concert is held again,

87
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:37,672
but not now.

88
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:39,553
I can't risk both of your lives,

89
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,193
you understand?

90
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:42,912
How is this a life-threatening issue?

91
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,432
Have we even been in any danger
over the past few days?

92
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,672
It's all in your head.

93
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:53,232
Just put up with this
for a little longer.

94
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:54,393
It will end soon.

95
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,513
I'm upset now. Go out.

96
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,713
Remember to finish the milk.

97
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:27,633
I'm here first.

98
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,393
Miao has used the toilet three times

99
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:43,912
within 30 minutes.

100
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:45,832
Is she okay?

101
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:52,712
Wu Miao!

102
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:53,552
Wu Miao!

103
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,033
Wu Yu, I'm fine,

104
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:57,832
but I can't go out right now.

105
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,752
Keep the window and the door locked.

106
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,793
Only come out when I call you.

107
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:02,552
You hear me?

108
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:05,393
Wu Yu,

109
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:06,393
I looked around.

110
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,312
I think we're the only unit
experiencing a power outage.

111
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:39,712
Wu Miao!

112
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:42,273

Wu Yu.

117
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:53,473
Let go of him, Wu Yu.

118
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,233
He's Zhu Yutong.

119
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:06,473
Wu Yu.

120
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,592
What is going on?

121
00:10:27,832 --> 00:10:30,513
I was trying
to sneak out to the concert.

122
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:39,592
I smashed the power distribution box
at your door.

123
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:42,353
I'm sorry, Wu Yu.

124
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:51,712
Wu Yu.

125

126

127
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:05,912
I know you may not understand

128
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:07,393
what I'm about to tell you.

129
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,393

cares about you.

130

Do you have any idea that he...

131
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:19,952
Anyway, you must keep this in mind.

132
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,512
You should never, ever leave the house

133
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:23,153
before November 5.

134
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,113
Got it?

135
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:26,952
What

136
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,432
about the day after November 5?

137
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,792
We will catch him

138
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,832
before that.

139
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:49,952
Come on.

140
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,072
I'm sorry, Wu Yu.

141

I've learned my lesson.

142
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,513
I won't do it again.

143
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,113
Wu Yu, I shouldn't have...

Wu Yu,

146
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,393
I will leave now.

147

Don't blame Miao anymore.

148
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:06,672
I did

149
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,393
all these things alone.

150
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:12,033
I'm sorry, Wu Yu.

151
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,912
You want to go to the concert, right?

152
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,072
We will go together.

153
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:21,832
Wu Yu...

154
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,592
You've put on makeup.

155
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:25,912
You would be so disappointed
if you can't go, wouldn't you?

156
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,993
You've been cooped up
at home for too long.

Officer Shen.

174

Thank you.

175
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:18,233
It's what I should do.

176
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,112
Actually, I came today

177
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:21,753
to ask Tan Jiao about something.

178
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:23,353
I?

179
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,232
Here's the thing.

180
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,232
A fine dining restaurant

181
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,072
has recently opened by the lake.

182
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:30,952
I think Zhou Xiaoyu will like it.

183
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,153
The one called Fall In Love, right?

184
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,112
Zhuang Yu likes restaurants like that.

185
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,512
The thing is I tried
to make a reservation,

186
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:42,233
but the earliest one is a month later.

187
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:43,712
So, I'd like to know,

188
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,512
other than dinner date,

189

what kind of dates does Zhou Xiaoyu like?

190
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,312
Do you know about railway museum?

191
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,992
It has every locomotive from

192
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,393
the Age of Steam onwards.

193
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,153
If a guy takes me there for a date,

194
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,633
I will marry him on the spot!

and railway museum.

198

That's the weirdest dating scenario

199

205
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:21,232
Yes.

206

He is lying!

Huang was watching Chen Xingjian.

He was debugging equipment at the bar.

390

He never left.

391
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,232
Other staff at the bar

392
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:37,353
can also attest to that.

393
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:38,993
They're in cahoots.

394
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:41,193
They are lying to cover for him.

395
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:42,752
I know he threatened you before...

396
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:44,392
Captain Ding, you have to trust me.

397
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,633
I was the one he wanted to kill,

398
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:48,592
but he couldn't find a chance
over the last couple days.

399
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:50,913
So he killed my best friend.

400
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,072
He was getting back at me.

401
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:55,273
I got it.

402
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:59,832
He's afraid I'll get in the way
of his murder plans.

403
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,872
But we conducted a series
of investigations on him.

404
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:04,273
We found that he didn't have
any murder plans.

405
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:06,352
He killed three girls.

406
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:08,792
Next,

407
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:11,433
he will kill Xu Jingmiao.

Actually...

417
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,433
The truth is I came back
from the future.

418

to stop Chen Xingjian
from killing people.

That day when he kidnapped Xu Jingmiao,

421
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:38,433
Wu Yu really saw it.

422
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:39,312
He really saw it.

423
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,433
He can see things
from ten kilometers away!

424
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:42,872
You have to trust me, Captain Ding!

425
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,033

426

Captain Ding, let me finish.

429
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,353
He is in my memory.

430
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:52,472
He was on that island.

431
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:54,193
He really is the murderer!

432
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,112
If you don't take action now,

433

Wu Miao and Xu Jingmiao

434
