the wine just now.

173
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:33,633
I think you're deliberately asking
for troubles.

174
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:34,914
I...

175
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:37,034
Are you alright?

176
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:38,274
Leave.

177
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:41,473
Are you okay?

178
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:48,274
Thank you.

179
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,034
It's you.

180
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,993
Have we met before?

181
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:00,113
No.

182
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,194
I've mistaken you for someone else.

183
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:02,154
It's alright.

184
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:04,113
Are you all alright?

185
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:05,674
I'm fine.

186
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:07,154
Thank you.

187
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:08,954
Be careful while being alone.

188
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:10,753
I'm leaving.

189
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:12,154
Okay.

190
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:16,274
Brother,

191
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,194
you were amazing.

192
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:19,593
You looked ferocious.

193
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:21,513
I didn't know that you had it in you.

194
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:22,833
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,394
Never mind.

196
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,473
You were brave just now.

197
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:35,993
But it was very dangerous to do that.

198
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,833
Do not risk your life like this again.

199
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:39,873
You hear me?

200
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,434
It was urgent just now.

201
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:41,753
Look...

202
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:42,873
You can't do that either.

203
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:44,833
I understand.

204
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:50,513
Zhu,

205
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,593
take care of my sister for me.

206
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:53,833
Keep her out of danger.

207
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:55,074
Okay.

208
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,074
How did he know that my surname is Zhu?

209
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:21,314
Aren't you going to watch over Wu Miao?

210
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,074
There are still three months away
from that day.

211
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,833
If I follow her closely everywhere
like this,

212
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,873
it'll only make her feel nervous.

213
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:32,633
Besides, Zhu is not a bad guy.

214
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:34,194
Zhu?

215
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,074
You know

216
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:38,314
that Zhu?

217
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:40,074
His name is Zhu Yutong.

218
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:41,593
He's Wu Miao's boyfriend.

219
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:44,233
But why can't I tell...

220
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:47,993
So you mean...

221
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,914
The last time I saw him was
on the funeral.

222
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,593
He looked awful.

223
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:56,394
He was like a walking corpse.

224
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:57,753
He said he could see

225
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,113
Wu Miao smiling once he closed his eyes.

226
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,554
He committed suicide

227
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:03,593
after the funeral.

228
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:07,794
(I read the letter he left.)

229
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,034
(He said the death
of Wu Miao was a disaster,)

230
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,233
(it was also an accident.)

231
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:13,873
(His whole world collapsed.)

232
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,074
(He can't think of any reason
to stay in this world.)

233
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,434
We were going to stop Yan Yuan

234
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,473
from meeting Zhu Jirui.

235
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:28,434
We didn't expect this would lead
to their meeting.

236
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:32,794
Since

237
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,353
we must rescue Wu Miao this time,

238
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:39,074
we should also let the person
who genuinely loves her

239
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:40,833
to stay by her side forever.

240
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,274
It seems like the people
who are destined to meet

241
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,554
will eventually meet each other.

242
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:50,554
You think it that way?

243
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,274
Don't you think so?

244
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:59,074
I thought differently before.

245
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,633
Before I met you.

246
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,993
You didn't get hurt, did you?

247
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:44,194
Thanks to you.

248
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,593
That bad guy was too arrogant.

249
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,794
I didn't help much just now.

250
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:51,633
Yet, I even made a fool of myself.

251
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,434
But you were very brave.

252
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:54,593
Nowadays,

253
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,554
I've never seen a courageous girl

254
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:57,593
like you.

255
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,674
There was a lot of people.

256
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,353
He wouldn't dare to do anything to me.

257
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,513
But come to think of it,
it was quite scary.

258
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:06,633
You're a girl.

259
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,554
You should be careful

260
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,713
when you go out next time.

261
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:10,353
By the way,

262
00:13:10,353 --> 00:13:12,194
was the guy back there your brother?

263
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,154
He's good at fighting.

264
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:17,353
He subdued the bad guy
with just a few moves.

265
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:18,914
Of course.

266
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,394
Because he's my brother.

267
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:24,154
But your brother must've been proud

268
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:26,794
to have a sister like you.

269
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,833
But he's too verbose.

270
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:31,513
He doesn't allow me to do anything.

271
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:32,954
Especially in these two days.

272
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,113
He's been acting mysterious.

273
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,713
And I don't know why.

274
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,820
(May Time Flies)

275
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:39,873
You're a fan of Qizhu?

276
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:41,593
You too?

277
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,154
I like this novel very much.

278
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,113
May Time Flies.

279
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:46,113
I like it too.

280
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:47,194
I've read it for the third time.

281
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:47,794
Really?

282
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:56,473
Have we met before?

283
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,394
You said the same thing
your brother did.

284
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,194
This opening line is actually quite old.

285
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:04,113
I was afraid that you'd be

286
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:05,554
some sort of pervert who stalked me.

287
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,274
I'm a pervert?

288
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:09,633
Reasonably speaking,

289
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:10,873
with this look of mine,

290
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,194
I should at least engage in a career

291
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,314
which is more promising
than being a pervert.

292
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,593
I remember it.

293
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,034
Are you from Jinghai?

294
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,074
Did you open a stationery store

295
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:19,914
in front of Jinghai University?

296
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:21,113
The one with Brown at the door?

297
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:22,554
How did you know that?

298
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:24,473
You really know me?

299
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:26,434
I bought resource materials there
when I was in high school.

300
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:27,674
I bought novels there after I graduated.

301
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:28,993
You'll offer discounts
on every Wednesday.

302
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:32,873
I bought this at your store.

303
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,473
You're a big customer.

304
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:36,113
My name is Wu Miao.

305
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:37,993
My name is Zhu Yutong.

306
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:12,914
Here's your room.

307
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:15,154
I'll go back first.

308
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:17,674
Wait.

309
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:20,314
Well...

310
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,233
Well,

311
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:26,713
about that matter.

312
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:29,473
I mean that matter.

313
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,833
I hope that you won't mind it.

314
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:34,633
Don't take it personally.

315
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:35,993
Anyway,

316
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:38,633
we're all adults.

317
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,154
Don't take it personally.

318
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:41,873
Of course.

319
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,113
I won't take it personally as well.

320
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,233
What do you mean?

321
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:55,154
You seriously don't know what I mean?

322
00:15:57,753 --> 00:15:58,353
I...

323
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:03,713
Forget it.

324
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:04,914
Goodbye,

325
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:06,274
Mr. Wu Yu.

326
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:16,154
Brother,

327
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,353
didn't you say

328
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,473
I can only eat an ice-cream in a day?

329
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:20,593
You were so brave just now.

330
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:21,394
This is a reward for you.

331
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,554
But you must be careful next time.

332
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,274
When did you become so reasonable?

333
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,233
Speaking of being reasonable,

334
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:31,554
Miao,

335
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:32,713
let me ask you a question.

336
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,314
If you're reasonable

337
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,353
with a person,

338
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,314
that you want to risk your life
to help him.

339
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,434
But sometimes, you'll be irritable

It depends on the person.

Is it a friend, elder or passer-by?

344

It's a close person.

I didn't.

353

Actually, sometimes,

a girl isn't mad for real.

355

She just wants you to pamper her.

is a person who needs romance.

361
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:37,313

has always been
an ideal setting for a couple

00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:22,033
I returned to that cruise.

678
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:23,274
Which cruise?

679
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:25,914
The mysterious cruise.

680
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:27,274
I returned to that cruise,

681
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:29,033
stayed there for a day
and I came back again.

682
00:36:29,513 --> 00:36:30,714
I'm very sure

683
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:32,513
that it wasn't a dream this time.

684
00:36:32,993 --> 00:36:33,673
Because

685
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:36,394
I came back with Wu Yu.

686
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:37,473
Who?

687
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:38,193
Wu Yu.

688
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:40,513
I mean... I mean the male lead.

689
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:42,954
You mean him?

690
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:44,633
You remember him?

691
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:46,274
I remember.

692
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:47,513
Wasn't he the failed affair

693
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:49,033
that you encountered on the cruise?

694
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:51,193
Do you have

695
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:52,633
feelings for him?

696
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,434
Why did you dream of him again
after a year?

697
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:56,513
After a year?

698
00:36:58,153 --> 00:36:59,834
Didn't you ever see him in Dali?

699
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:01,394
No.

700
00:37:04,993 --> 00:37:05,874
What's the date today?

701
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:07,754
Nineteenth.

702
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:08,394
What's the month?

703
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:09,394
August.

704
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:10,794
Nineteenth of August.

705
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:14,033
Now is fifth of September in year 2022.

706
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:16,513
It's already been a year
since the departure

707
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:18,834
of Diamond Star.

708
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,033
It's still year 2022?

709
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:22,714
Of course.

710
00:37:22,794 --> 00:37:24,033
What's wrong with you?

711
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,993
The time is actually advanced?

712
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,914
So it means

713
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:37,754
I haven't met Wu Yu again.

714
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:42,714
No wonder Hua doesn't recognise me.

715
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,993
What is all this mess?

716
00:37:44,993 --> 00:37:46,954
Can you start from the beginning?

717
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:48,274
So you mean

718
00:37:48,274 --> 00:37:49,954
you haven't bumped
into Shen Shiyan's car?

719
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:51,874
Shen Shiyan?

720
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:53,993
Isn't he your blind date?

721
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:55,513
What has he got to do with me?

722
00:37:57,394 --> 00:37:58,314
I'm screwed.

723
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:00,314
Everything is messed up.

724
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:02,874
Let me figure it out.

725
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:03,754
What?

726
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:08,234
Wu Miao.

727
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:09,993
Right, Wu Miao.

728
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:12,714
What's the matter?

729
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:13,434
