What did he say?

61

He said Chen Xingjian's
mission is completed.

He'll take care of Tan Jiao himself.

64
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
did he say after that?

Don't move!

you have nowhere to run.

75
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,380
I said, don't move.

76
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,220
Do you want to die?

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,020
Are you okay?

Why are you here?

84
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,900
Who's your accomplice?

85
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,380
Tell me!

86
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,980
I...

87
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,700
Wu Yu.

88
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,820
What's going on?

89
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,060
This man attacked Tan Jiao with a knife

90
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,940
while she was alone.

91
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,860
Nonsense!

92
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,100
I wanted to save her!

93
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,460
You?

94
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,900
How did you end up here?

95
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,300
Why can't I be here?

96
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,260
I met with a shipwreck and fainted.

97
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,460
I was already there when I woke up.

98
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,820
Do you know each other?

99
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,740
Yes.

100
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
His name is Chen Xingjian.

101
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,460
We used to have a band together.

102
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,980
We disbanded because of discord.

103
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,620
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.

104
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,660
Why don't you let him go first?

105
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,900
Misunderstanding?

106
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,460
I don't want to be
with a traitor like you.

107
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,620
Who are you calling a traitor?

108
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Someone unknown in the past

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,420
who'd do anything for money.

110
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,780
Say that again.

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,420
Enough!

112
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,020
Why did you attack Tan Jiao?

113
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,700
Are the two missing girls related

114
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,660
to you?

115
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,500
What two girls?

116
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,620
Are you guys...

117
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,820
Tell us.

118
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,660
Okay.

119
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,460
You're ganging up on me
because I'm outnumbered, huh?

120
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,420
Fine.

121
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,820
I wanted to kill her.

122
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,140
I also captured those two girls.

123
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,100
What are you going to do about it?

124
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,780
- Hey!
- Calm down.

125
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,820
- Where are they now?
- Stop it!

126
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,620
Are you going to tell us or not?

127
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,860
You're going to rough me up, huh?

128
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,780
I caught them for fun.

129
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,860
So? Are you going to kill me?

130
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,620
Stop it.

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,220
Wait.

132
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,460
Wait.

133
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,980
Are you okay?

134
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm fine.

135
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
You wanted

136
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,140
to kill the snake with the knife, right?

137
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,140
You're so imaginative.

138
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,220
I wanted to kill you.

139
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,220
It killed the snake

140
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,300
by mistake.

141
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,980
That's enough.

142
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,220
Everyone, please calm down.

143
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,380
Don't be agitated.

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,140
We can talk nicely about this.

145
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,100
Excuse me, mister.

146
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,780
Where's my daughter?

147
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,220
Your daughter

148
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,540
may be...

149
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,220
She may be dead.

150
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,100
Stop talking nonsense.

151
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,460
Mom!

152
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,820
Ying!

153
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,060
Did you call me?

154
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,100
Ying,

155
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,340
where have you been?

156
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
You scared me!

157
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,180
Excuse me.

158
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,140
Why are you alone?

159
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,660
Isn't Miss Zhu Jirui

160
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,580
with you?

161
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,340
Did you see her?

162
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,340
Miss Zhu?

163
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,860
Yes.

164
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,180
She's just in front.

165
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,420
Do you want me to take you there?

166

Let's go.

167
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,340
Be careful.

168
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,540
Over here.

169
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,060
Be careful.

170
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,100
She's there.

171

Rui,

172
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,500
are you okay?

173
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,020
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

174

I'm not hurt.

175
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,620
What about you guys?

176
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,140
We're fine.

177
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,380
We've been looking for you by the beach.

178
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,580
Mom,

179
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,420
you're unbelievable.

180
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
I only wanted to be alone for a while.

181
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,500
Do you need to make a fuss about this?

182
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,660
It's embarrassing.

183
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Do you know
I was worried sick about you?

184
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,140
How could you go off
without telling anyone?

185
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
You're too insensible.

186
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,300
What?

187
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,900
We were only here for half an hour.

188
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,740
We're not kids here.

189
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,740
Half an hour?

190
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,620
Are you mad?

191
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,780
Everyone had been looking for you two

192
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,660
all day.

193
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,580
He's right.

194
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,180
We were worried about you guys.

195
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,420
Why do you have to say that?

196
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,100
She was with me too.

197
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,700
What's wrong with two adults coming out

198
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,460
for a walk?

199
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,100
Are you saying

200
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,660
you only left the campsite

201
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,020
for half an hour?

202
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,260
Tan Jiao, what do you mean by that?

203
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,300
Are you saying we're lying?

204
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,100
Keep quiet.

205
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,700
She wasn't in a good mood.

206
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,820
So I comforted her.

207
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,300
We really didn't take too much time.

208
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,220
Look at this.

209
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,940
Are you behind this?

210
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,380
Do you think I'm capable of that?

211
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,700
Could this be a special species?

212
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,300
I don't think it's the species.

213
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,940
There's no plant
that blooms and withers

214
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,100
in such a short time.

215
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,540
We saw many of these over there.

216
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,820
Let's check them out.

217
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,500
Be gentle.

218
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,900
Be gentle.

219
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,060
It's pretty.

220
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,900
Don't be scared.

221
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,540
No ghost comes out during the day.

222
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,420
Huh?

223
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,540
What's wrong?

224
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,020
I know what's going on now.

225
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,820
Check the time.

226
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,620
Wait for me.

227
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,180
Wu Yu.

228
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,140
Wu Yu.

229
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,820
Yu.

230
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,260
How long did it take?

231
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,780
It's been seven seconds.

232
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,220
I spent two minutes there.

233
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,500
The flowers didn't bloom quicker,

234
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,620
or people walked faster.

235
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,020
The time is the issue here.

236
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,300
The time doesn't flow regularly.

237
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,860
Miss Zhu and Ying's

238
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,100
half-hour stay there

239
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,540
is equivalent to half a day here.

240
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,900
See? I told you.

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,820
I wasn't lying.

242
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,780
This situation doesn't happen
by accident.

243
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,540
Time is affected by energy.

244
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,220
So I'm guessing this island
has a unique magnetic field,

245
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,940
which is powerful enough to warp time.

246
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,100
I think this is the reason

247
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,260
the rescue team is not here yet.

248
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,340
Yu,

249
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,420
are you saying

250
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,820
they aren't able to come?

251
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,660
I don't want to live on this island
for the rest of my life.

252
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,060
You'll be lucky if you can.

253
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,740
The provisions from the boat

254
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,900
are running out soon.

255
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,780
Calm down.

256
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,540
Let's find a way together.

257
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,300
We'll definitely be rescued.

258
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,060
That's easy for you to say.

259
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,980
What should we eat?

260
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,860
Are we going to depend
on your admirer to catch fish?

261
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,940
Keep quiet.

262
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,620
He's not reliable.

263
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,100
If you want food,

264
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,020
I have plenty.

265
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,140
It's better

266
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,340
to rely on me.

267
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,220
Were you the one who left the wrapper?

268
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,820
Not only those.

269
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,380
I have plenty of food.

270
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,860
Let me go now.

271
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,180
If you don't,
I won't share the food with you.

272
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,180
We'll let you go
after you take us there.

273
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,500
This old woman is pretty suspicious.

274
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,180
Who are you calling an old woman?

275
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,100
I can take you there.

276
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,700
But

277
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,220
I have one condition.

278
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,500
What is it?

279
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,460
I want this girl to kiss me.

280
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,220
Say that again.

281
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,860
Stop fighting.

282
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,460
I'll kill you if you keep this on.

283
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,940
Enough!

284
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,460
You're obsessed!

285
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,060
Stop causing trouble.

286
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,340
You want to kill me?

287
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,500
Just cut it out.

288
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,300
Then forget about the food.

289
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,180
All of you can die,

290
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,060
and that'll be the end of it!

291
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,860
You better respect my friends and me.

292
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,060
Or else, I won't be nice.

293
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,740
Okay.

294
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,900
I was only kidding.

295
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
Don't be mad.

296
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,620
I... I'll take you guys there.

297
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,300
Okay?

298
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,140
I'll take you guys there.

299
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,700
Lead the way.

300
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,940
Be careful.

301
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,540
Hurry up.

302
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,580
Watch your head.

303
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,740
Be careful.

304
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,420
Mom, be careful.

305
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,100
Be careful.

306
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,060
It's so shabby.

307
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,580
Where is it?

308
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,060
The food is inside.

309
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
How do we know

310
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,300
if you set up a trap in the cave?

311
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,060
The food is inside, in any case.

312
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,220
If you're not a coward, come with me.

313
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,100
The men should go in first.

314
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,060
Hurry up!

315
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,900
It's inside.

316
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,500
Watch where you walk.

317
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,140
Ying,

318
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,700
be careful.

319
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,780
Be careful.

320
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,900
Are you sure the food is here?

321
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,580
What's your problem?

322
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,860
Stop being rude to me.

323
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,860
I have a name, you know?

324
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,620
I can't believe this guy.

325
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,980
May I know

326
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,380
where's the food?

327
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,300
That's more like it.

328
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Since you asked,

329
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,180
I'll be kind enough to tell you.

330
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,140
I woke up in this place.

331
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,020
I see this place as my house.

332
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,500
Without me,

333
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,060
you can't even find it.

334
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,140
Come along now.

335
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Watch where you're going.

336
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,500
Be careful.

337
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,220
There are many stones ahead.

338
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,340
You have to be careful.

339
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,980
If he's a survivor
of the shipwreck like us,

340
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,220
how did he

341
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,420
end up in this cave?

342
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,580
This guy says whatever he wants.

343
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,460
We don't even know
if he's telling the truth

344
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,420
or lying.

345
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,540
And did you notice

346
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
this Chen Xingjian

347
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,780
does not look the same

348
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
as the one we met?

349
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,100
Yes.

350
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,860
His manner of speaking and expression

351
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,060
is like that of another person.

352
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,580
He even saved me once.

353
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,580
Chen Xingjian of the future
is vile, cold-blooded,

354
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,780
and meticulous.

355
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,060
He even provokes to infuriate us.

356
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,540
We were helpless against him.

357
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,300
While this guy here

358
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,700
couldn't stand up straight
when you frightened him.

359
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,340
I know what you mean.

360
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,980
But what did he experience

361
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,580
that made him change drastically?

362
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,580
Do you still remember
what Xu Jingmiao said

363
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,540
about another accomplice?

364
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,460
Chen Xingjian was only
an accessory to crime.

365
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
The mastermind was someone else.

366
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,340
Are you saying

367
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,700
that he's only following orders?

368
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,420
But even so,

369
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,540
his behavior shouldn't have
such a drastic change.

370
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,060
Something is amiss here.

371
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,380
Let me see what he's up to.

372
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,140
Follow me.

373
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,100
Be careful.

374
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,860
(What exactly makes)

375
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,260
(a person)

376
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,060
(change into a completely
different person?)

377
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,260
Are you troubled?

378
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,020
No.

379
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,380
But I could feel

380
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,780
you're very different

381
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,940
from minutes ago.

382
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,540
I don't know

383
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,620
why I feel that

384
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,060
your life has changed a lot

385
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,860
in just a few minutes.

386
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,140
Just like these flowers.

387
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,140
It seems like their time

388
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,820
was stolen away in an instant.

389
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,020
Sometimes, we would lose something.

390
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,820
But I think

391
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,020
we'll reunite what we lost

392
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,260
at another time.

393
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,300
Reunite at another time...

394
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,300
Since the universe lets you meet

395
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,980
over and over again,

396
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,260
it shows

397
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,420
there's a strong
and invisible attraction between you.

398
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,620
If one of you change,

399
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,700
the other one will change too.

400
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,220
I think that's the kind
of connection you have.

401
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,780
Thanks.

402
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,860
See?

403
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,540
I knew you were troubled.

404
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,020
Let's go.

405
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,940
Be careful.

406
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,180
Hurry up.

407
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,260
It's up ahead.

408
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,940
We're here!

409
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,020
These trunks are full of goods.

410
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,340
We have dry food and water.

411
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,340
Gosh.

412
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,660
There are so many of them.

413
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,140
We can hold on

414
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
until the rescue comes for us.

415
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,620
See? I didn't lie.

416
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
There are so many of us here.

417
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,020
You better behave.

418
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,740
Don't pull any tricks.

419
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,100
I get no thanks at all.

420
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,580
Eat something.

421
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,220
I was wondering
why didn't you want to eat.

422
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,180
So you're hiding
to eat all this yourself?

423
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:24,900
What?

424
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,940
I didn't have this on me.

425
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,580
I took it out from here.

426
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,100
See?

427
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,060
Just like this.

428
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,780
Where did it go?

429
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,180
You...

430
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,420
So it was you all along.

431
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,380
Thank you.

432
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,540
I didn't know

433
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,100
you could do magic tricks.

434
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,100
Oh, this?

435
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,260
If I weren't forced,

436
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,300
I wouldn't have learned it.

437
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,900
What do you mean?

438
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,540
Didn't you learn it out of interest?

439
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,500
Let's not talk about that.

440
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,900
Tell me about yourself.

441
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,820
Here you are all alone.

442
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,940
But you're not taking good care
of yourself.

443
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,740
Your family would be worried sick.

444
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,980
Yeah.

445
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,060
I guess they're worried about me.

446
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,980
He... He's...

447
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,180
Are you from the Zhu Family?

448
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,340
My last name is Zhu.

449
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,780
Of course, I'm from the Zhu Family.

450
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,380
I'll go

451
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,260
and do some inventory count.

452
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,260
Have some water.

453
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,580
Thanks.

454
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,180
No problem.

455
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,220
I want to ask you something.

456
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,940
Are you close with Chen Xingjian?

457
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,180
What kind of person is he?

458
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,780
He...

459
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Let me show you this.

460
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,380
I wrote the chorus

461
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,060
for the song you wrote the other day.

462
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,220
Take a look.

463
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,980
Not bad, right?

464
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,500
Let's do it.

465
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,860
(After we rise to popularity,)

466
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,300
(we'll sell this song)

467
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,820
(to witness our talent and friendship.)

468
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,140
(You sold the song we wrote.)

469
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,180
I didn't expect
you'd even sell yourself.

470
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,420
I know you quit working at the bar

471
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,940
to sign a contract
with the influencer marketing company.

472
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,980
Yes, I signed with them.

473
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,340
The manager saw our performance.

474
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,460
He said I'll be famous.

475
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,460
After I become famous,

476
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,580
we can fulfill...

477
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Cut the crap!

478
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
Fulfill what?

479
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,140
Can you become famous?

480
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,820
You said it's for music.

481
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,260
Why can't we try

482
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,540
and change our concept
for the sake of music?

483
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,740
After I'm successful,

484
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,260
I'll sing whatever I want

485
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,140
and let those who like me

486
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,100
gradually like rock music.

487
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
How is that bad?

488
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,380
You were tricked!

489
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,740
You'll never have the chance!

490
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,460
I'm sorry.

491
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,260
I can do it.

492
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,060
Zhou Wei,

493
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,140
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,060
I'm sorry, okay?

495
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,140
I don't care if you sold those songs.

496
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,620
We can write better ones.

497
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,420
We have our audience.

498
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,820
We can already sing halftime now.

499
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,940
This is proof.

500
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,740
I'm sorry.

501
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,940
I want to give it a shot.

502
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,340
You're a traitor if you leave!

503
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,260
A traitor to music!

504
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,420
I'll prove that I'm right.

505
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,060
(How do I put this?)

506
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,660
He may be mean in his words.

507
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,620
But he's definitely a good guy.

508
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,500
And he loves music very much.

509
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,500
I think he's more talented than me.

510
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,780
So I think it was only
a misunderstanding

511
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,180
about him attacking Tan Jiao.

512
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,980
Wait here.

513
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,100
Can I ask you something?

514
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,500
What are the odds?

515
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,420
I happened to have something
to ask you too.

516
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,660
We'll take turns, then.

517
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,780
Deal.

518
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,940
You said you woke up in this cave.

519
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,020
Was there anyone else here

520
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,060
after you woke up?

521
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,100
I did wake up

522
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,260
in this cave.

523
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,380
There wasn't anyone else.

524
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,860
My turn.

525
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,420
I saved you.

526
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,860
But why did you say

527
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,980
you want to kill me
more than anyone else?

528
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,660
Because you took
someone important away from me.

529
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,220
Him?

530
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,540
These women are sure jealous.

531
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,900
But don't worry.

532
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,580
I like women.

533
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,060
I like women.

534
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,900
I have something else to ask.

535
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,580
Why do you have so many questions?

536
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,380
Are you Mr. Why?

537
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,100
Fine. Just ask.

538
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,220
I'm the Subor brand book reader device.

539
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,700
You can pick anything you don't know,
and I'll read it to you.

540
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,020
Since everyone

541
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,180
was washed up here by the waves,

542
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,220
why are you the only one

543
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,500
that ends up in this cave?

544
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,420
When I woke up,
I was already in the cave.

545
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,020
But not this cave.

546
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,980
If you don't believe me,

547
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,420
I can take you there.

548
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,420
Something's weird.

549
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,420
I remember

550
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,140
there was a cave
full of crystals nearby.

551
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,700
They're all gone now.

552
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,420
What crystal cave?

553
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,340
The whole cave

554
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,700
is full of shiny stones.

555
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,180
I think they're pretty valuable.

556
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,580
Since we can't find them,

557
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,260
maybe they're on a different path.

558
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,140
You said

559
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,180
you were lying here when you woke up.

560
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,980
But there's no water around here.

561
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,420
How did you get washed up here?

562
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,020
How am I supposed to know?

563
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,620
Sleepwalking.

564
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,780
I'm sure it was sleepwalking.

565
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,180
I dreamed I was at the beach.

566
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,620
Then I slowly walked

567
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,540
to this place step by step.

568
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,260
Can you be more serious?

569
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,060
They're being serious here.

570
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,860
What's the point
of making up stories like this?

571
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,060
Of course, there's a point.

572
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,100
It's better than looking
for an agency to sign a contract.

573
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,060
Have you written a decent song
after all these years?

574
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
All the songs you write are repetitive.

575
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,060
It gets worse and worse.

576
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
You can insult me.

577
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,780
But you can't insult my music!

578
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,700
So what if I insult you?

579
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
I dare you to say that again!

580
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,660
Are you trying to get physical?

581
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,580
- Are you...
- I dare you to say that again!

582
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,380
You even want to raise your hand.

583
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,460
- Let me go!
- Let him go.

584
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,340
You hit me.

585
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,780
So what if I did?

586
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,260
You're such a letdown.

587
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,820
I regretted being in a band with you!

588
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,420
I...

589
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
Stop fighting.

590
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,180
It's going to collapse.

591
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,660
Tan Jiao!

592
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,700
Wu Yu!

593
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,020
Tan Jiao. Tan Jiao.

594
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,380
Tan Jiao!

595
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,180
Tan Jiao!

596
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,580
Tan Jiao!

597
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,020
Check on the rest.

598
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,660
I'll go and save Tan Jiao.

599
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,180
Okay.

600
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,060
It's okay. I can do it myself.

601
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,020
Uh.

602
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,740
Why haven't they come out yet?

603
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,700
What's wrong?

604
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,220
The cave collapsed.

605
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,860
Where are the rest?

606
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,500
Where's Yu?

607
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,660
Where are Wu Yu and Tan Jiao?

608
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,220
Tan Jiao is trapped.

609
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,580
Wu Yu went to save her.

610
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,260
(Wu Yu, calm down.)

611
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,860
(She's waiting for you.)

612
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,140
I think it's no longer collapsing.

613
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,020
Let's go and save them.

614
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,020
Okay.

615
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,260
Be careful.

616
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,300
Wait.

617
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,260
It's dangerous inside.

618
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,900
The girls should stay outside.

619
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,380
Yan Yuan,

620
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,900
please stay here
to take care of the girls.

621
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,980
Also, bring these things back
to the campsite.

622
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,540
I'll go with Zhou Wei.

623
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,260
Be careful, okay?

624
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,700
You must be careful.

625
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Be careful.

626
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,700
Let's go.

627
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,020
Be careful.

628
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,900
Come.

629
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,740
It's okay. I can carry it myself.

630
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,580
Let me help you carry one.

631
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,660
Be careful.

632
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,540
Tan Jiao!

633
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,700
Tan Jiao!

634
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,220
Tan Jiao! Tan Jiao!

635
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,420
Tan Jiao!

636
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,300
Tan...

637
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,220
Wu Yu.

638
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,220
Tan Jiao,

639
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,460
are you okay?

640
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,140
I'm fine.

641
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,660
Are you okay?

642
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,460
I'm okay too.

643
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm glad to hear that.

644
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,180
Just now,

645
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,020
he blocked the rock for me.

646
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,380
But he was knocked unconscious.

647
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,500
How is he?

648
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,460
He just passed out.

649
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,740
Can you imagine

650
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,180
in another time and space,

651
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,820
he killed my best friend,

652
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,260
your sister,

653
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,620
and even wanted to kill me?

654
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,940
Yet, in this space and time,

655
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,740
he rescued me twice.

656
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,380
It's indeed hard to believe.

657
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,100
But seeing what happened on this island,

658
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,140
he didn't seem to be putting up an act.

659
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,860
The food can't be faked.

660
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,620
And he cannot predict

661
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,780
our every move

662
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,620
and accident that happens.

663
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,820
All these can't be arranged in advance.

664
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,900
But I feel conflicted.

665
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,300
I don't know how to face someone

666
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,220
who will kill Xiaoyu

667
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
and many innocent girls in the future.

668
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,700
I even...

669
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,340
I even

670
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,900
helped him bandage his wound just now.

671
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,500
You did the right thing.

672
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,620
If Xiaoyu were here,

673
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,220
she'd do the same thing.

674
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,260
But I feel so uneasy.

675
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,740
Even if Chen Xingjian is innocent
at this moment,

676
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,420
are we going

677
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,860
to watch him

678
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,780
turn into a heinous killer?

679
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,860
We're indulging him

680
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,900
