She's Zhu Jirui.

Go and ask her.

I'd like to ask you

if you know Yan Yuan.

44
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:47,695
I heard that he stays nearby here.

I'm sorry.

I don't know the person you mentioned.

48
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,294
Maybe you can ask other people.

49
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,095
Miss Zhu.

50
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,574
Are you sure
that you don't know this person?

51
00:02:58,774 --> 00:02:59,855
He's Yan Yuan.

52
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,294
I don't know this person.

53
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,095
What do you want?

54
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,294
This is...

55
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:10,535
My boyfriend.

56
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:11,334
What's wrong?

57
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:14,415
Nothing.

58
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:15,774
Sorry to bother you, Miss Zhu.

59
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,054
Sorry.

60
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:25,774
So

61
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,614
we have already

62
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:30,294
changed the timeline.

63
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:37,334
What are you writing?

64
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,454
I'm sorting out the timeline
you mentioned.

65
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,494
Based on the information you gave,

66
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:43,695
I drew this graph.

67
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,054
Look.

68
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,574
This line represents time

69
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,655
and it extends forwards
in one direction.

70
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:53,894
You came back from this point
to this point.

71
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:55,815
This point represents
the 18th of September,

72
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:56,655
2022.

73
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:57,215
While the point you travelled back

74
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,174
is at 5th August 2021.

75
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,014
In this universe,

76
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,294
you've done something

77
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:03,975
and something has changed.

78
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:05,614
That time was

79
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,174
6th of August, 2021.

80
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,375
Therefore, the future you came back to

81
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,894
isn't the previous one,

82
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:14,695
but the new future

83
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:15,655
you've changed.

84
00:04:19,895 --> 00:04:20,655
What about this?

85
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,095
What does the dotted line represent?

86
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,655
It is the past
that you never experienced

87
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,015
in that timeline.

88
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,374
For example, the incident of Zhu Jirui

89
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,775
meeting with his boyfriend

90
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,535
that happened in this timeline.

91
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:34,455
I got it.

92
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:36,614
It means the incident

93
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:37,934
that didn't happen

94
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,614
because something has changed.

95
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,734
Yan Yuan disappears
from Zhu Jirui's life.

96
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:44,934
It's like the Butterfly Effect.

97
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,095
An insignificant change

98
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,054
can lead to variation in the future.

99
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:52,015
What about Wu Yu?

100
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:55,015
Does he forget about me?

101
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,855
It's possible.

102
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,494
Do you mean

103
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:03,775
that we managed to stop Zhu's tragedy

104
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:07,215
and Wu Miao's destiny has changed,

105
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:09,614
However, Wu Yu

106
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,814
disappears from my life.

107
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:15,934
Isn't this a new tragedy

108
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,535
replacing the previous one?

109
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,335
Does the law of conservation
apply in this?

110
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,535
Conserve?

111
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:22,614
Hold on.

112
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:23,895
Don't you care

113
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:26,134
about this Wu Yu too much?

114
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:28,134
Is there anything I don't know

115
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:28,855
that happened between you

116
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,054
on the cruise?

117
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:31,254
Did he propose to you?

118
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,415
I'll take that as a yes
if you stay silent.

119
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,254
Enough. Stop making fun of me.

120
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:46,975
Alright.

121
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,095
You'll meet other men later.

122
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,054
Since the timeline

123
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,415
has changed,

124
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,975

after the IELTS lesson.

174
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:51,494
So, you go out

175
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,254
to buy my favourite dessert.

176
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,335

Brother Yu.

Why is it you again?

199
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,855
Hello, may I take your order?

200
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,654
The environment of this cafe is bad

201
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:19,774
as well as the vibe here.

202
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:21,534
They need some upgrades.

203
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:23,414
Sorry, Miss.

204
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,095
I don't understand that.

205
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:27,654
She wants three iced lattes.

206
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,414
And one without milk.

207
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,654
Brother Yu is allergic to it.

208
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,374
Sure.

209
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,734
Dali is a tourist city though,

210
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,654
the service isn't up to mark.

211
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,614
Wet wipes aren't even provided here.

212
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,014
Brother Yu.

213
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:44,374
I go to wash my hands.

214
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,095
I've finally met you.

215
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:18,335
Great.

216
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,774
I went to the mechanic's shop
to look for you.

217
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:24,534
But, Hua told me

218
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:26,215
that he hasn't seen you for a long time.

219
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:27,614
I couldn't find your contact

220
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,095
in my phone as well.

221
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,095
I guess

222
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,215
it's because the timeline has reset.

223
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,254
But, I sent you a message through Weibo.

224
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:35,975
Oops.

225
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,654
I could only read messages
from accounts I followed.

226
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:40,494
I'm Wu Yu.

227
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:41,494
I'm at Jinghai now.

228
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:43,614
Something has changed about Wu Miao.

229
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,254
(Mobius)
I'll come to you once I figure it out.

230
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:46,855
What has happened to Wu Miao?

231
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:48,494
No sign of her.

232
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,975
It's a good sign.

233
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:01,935
At least she might still be alive.

234
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:05,215
We can find her together.

235
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,095
By the way,

236
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:12,614
did you find anything different

237
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:13,935
after

238
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:15,455
you came back this time?

239
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:17,254
Do you still remember

240
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,935
the photo I mentioned on the cruise?

241
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:21,534
Do you mean the photo

242
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,175
in which everyone died except for me?

243
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:27,254
This time,

244
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:28,774
I realised that except for Wu Miao,

245
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,695
there are changes in
Professor Chen and his family.

246
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:40,455
Why am I back?

247
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,175
The 19th of August.

248
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,055
How come the time
has moved back earlier?

249
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:57,215
Wu Miao.

250
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:05,095
Hello.

251
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:06,295
Hello, Captain Ding.

252
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:07,575
I'm Wu Yu.

253
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,095
Today is the 288th day

254
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,374
after Wu Miao went missing.

255
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,055
(Just and disciplined)
Although she hasn't been found yet,

256
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:13,815
please don't give up.

257
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,335
Please give us more time.

258
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,175
We'll definitely get her back.

259
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:20,095
Does it mean that she just went missing

260
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,095
and not dead, right?

261
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,335
Please be rest assured.

262
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:25,374
Currently, we haven't seen any sign

263
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:26,855
of her death.

264
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:31,975
If Zhu Yutong

265
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,335
was as tough as you

266
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,215
and gave us more time

267
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:37,175
to find Wu Miao,

268
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:39,414
perhaps he wouldn't have killed himself.

269
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:42,494
(So, nothing has changed
in Zhu Yutong's case.)

270
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:46,014
Well.

271
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,455
I'd like to ask about Professor Chen.

272
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:50,055
The case concerning
Professor Chen and his family

273
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:51,894
is determined to be an accidental fire.

274
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:54,975
Because the candles in the clubhouse
were accidentally knocked over

275
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:58,335
and that caused Professor Chen, Feng Yan
and the driver

276
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,774
were killed

277
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:00,774
in the fire.

278
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,095
Clubhouse?

279
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,414
Wasn't it a wedding hotel?

280
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:05,975
The accident of Professor Chen
and his wife happened

281
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:06,815
when they went for dinner.

282
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:09,575
What do you mean

283
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,494
by the wedding hotel?

284
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:12,614
Nothing.

285
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,575
If so, Chen Ruying is alive, right?

286
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:16,734
She didn't go with them

287
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,134
and dodged the accident.

288
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,815
Didn't you already know all about these?

289
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:21,894
Why do you ask again?

290
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:23,935
I just want to confirm it.

291
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,014
Please help me to find Wu Yu.

292
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:28,215
No worries.

293
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:30,215
We'll do our best.

294
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:31,014
For the following days,

295
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:31,855
I tried to find Wu Miao

296
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,335
with every method I could think of.

297
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,134
However, there was no trace of her.

298
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,855
When I was coming to meet with you,

299
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:39,734
Ying suddenly came.

300
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:41,455
Brother Yu.

301
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:44,134
I'm clueless about
where should I seek help.

302
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,460
(Potassium Cyanide. Danger.)

303
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:48,614
It's potassium cyanide.

304
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:49,734
Where did you get this?

305
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,414
Do you still remember Su Wan?

306
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,935
Is it the vice president
of your mother's company?

307
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,254
He's far from being a vice president.

308
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,614
He's just a sidekick
who buttered my mother up.

309
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,175
He used to stay in the house

310
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,734
provided by the company.

311
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,134
And the house contract was terminated
yesterday.

312
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:03,494
The owner asked me to clean the house
as he failed to reach Su Wan.

313
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,134
I discovered this there.

314
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:06,695
Brother Yu.

315
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,654
Do you remember there was news

316
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,654
about the serial poisoning cases?

317
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,614
Those girls were killed

318
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,614
by injecting potassium cyanide.

319
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:16,175
(Potassium Cyanide. Danger.)
Do you think

320
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,175
my parents' death wasn't an accident?

321
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,654
Would it be Su Wan?

322
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:22,055
Have you told the police about this?

323
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,254
They said

324
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:26,575
the call logs of Su Wan

325
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,254
showed that he went to Dali
half of a year ago

326
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,695
and he went missing then.

327
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:30,975
The police said
they'll keep me informed.

328
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,614
But, I'm really scared.

329
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:34,614
If what you said is true,

330
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:36,855
Su Wan is a dangerous man.

331
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:40,975
Brother Yu.

332
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:42,215
My parent had been treating you

333
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:43,734
like part of our family.

334
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,295
You're my only family member left now.

335
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:47,534
Please don't abandon me.

336
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:53,534
I see.

337
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,575
In the previous timeline,

338
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:56,935
the murderer used potassium cyanide

339
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:58,534
to kill five ladies

340
00:16:58,534 --> 00:16:59,414
including my sister.

341
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,014
While Professor Chen and his family

342
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:02,894
and Xu, the driver

343
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,055
were all killed in the clubhouse's fire.

344
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:06,654
But, Su Wan went missing

345
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:08,575
after the wedding ceremony.

346
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:09,815
I find it suspicious.

347
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,174
Do you suspect Su Wan

348
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,454
is the serial killer?

349
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:17,335
I got it.

350
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,255
Professor Chen discovered
something fishy about him.

351
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,295
That's why Professor Chen was killed.

352
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,934
And Chen Ruying and you
will be in danger then.

353
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,614
That's why I brought her to Dali.

354
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:31,335
But, I care more about you.

355
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:34,374
Do you still remember
someone wanted to harm you

356
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:36,654
before we returned to the cruise?

357
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:41,654
He's a vice president

358
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,414
and has nothing to do with us.

359
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,214
He won't harm me.

360
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,335
Anyway, you must be careful.

361
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,335
I'll stay by your side and protect you.

362
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:53,934
You must be careful too.

363
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,134
The washroom is too dirty.

364
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,174
Brother Yu.

365
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:58,694
Let's leave this place now.

366
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,174
I can't stand to stay anymore.

367
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:02,735
Let's go.

368
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,015
When we were on the cruise, I realised

369
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:14,855
that Chen Ruying likes you.

370
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,095
I'm just kidding.

371
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:21,735
Judging the current situation,

372
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,894
we better not upset her.

373
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:24,934
Let's go.

374
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,894
The coffee shop in Dali

375
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,815
is really unhygienic and...

376
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:47,894
Watch out!

377
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:52,894
Are you alright?

378
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,095
Brother Yu.

379
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:55,934
It's Su Wan.

380
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,255
The driver is Su Wan.

381
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,535
But the driver

382
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:01,535
covered all his face though.

383
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,255
Are you sure it was him?

384
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,654
Su Wan killed my parents.

385
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,335
I can recognise him even
if he has perished into ashes.

386
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:08,374
Well.

387
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:10,015
Let's go back now.

388
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,095
I really don't like Dali.

389
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:32,654
Ying.

390
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:34,335
I've booked a room for you.

391
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,654
You can check in at the counter now.

392
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:36,575
Brother Yu.

393
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,095
Aren't we staying together?

394
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:40,015
No.

395
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:41,174
We can't stay together.

396
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:42,535
But, I must

397
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:44,174
be around you.

398
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,815
Ying, don't be insensible.

399
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:48,374
Brother Yu.

400
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,174
You're inconsiderate.

401
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:51,575
Why would I have to make this request

402
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:53,414
if I'm not in danger?

403
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,295
Su Wan will show up anytime.

404
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,134
What if he wants to harm me?

405
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:02,015
Are you going to abandon me

406
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,454
after my parents have passed away?

407
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,454
No, Ying.

408
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,775
Brother Yu.

409
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:12,174
She can stay at my home.

410
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:14,775
Don't worry.

411
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:17,015
He won't be far from you.

412
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:27,374
Come on in.

413
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:31,735
The layout of your house is bad though.

414
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:33,815
It's only suitable for old
and unmarried women.

415
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:35,614
It can't cater for more guests.

416
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,575
May Time Flies?

417
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:41,934
What a lame name.

418
00:20:42,055 --> 00:20:43,134
I can tell it's a boring novel.

419
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:45,934
You have bad taste.

420
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:46,654
Ying.

421
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,535
Mind your mouth.

422
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,414
Well.

423
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:52,775
Where's the washroom?

424
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:53,654
I need to go to the toilet.

425
00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:07,055
Does she come back alive

426
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,735
to piss me off?

427
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:10,894
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:12,855
I didn't want to bother you with this.

429
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:15,295
I'm angry not because of this.

430
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:18,095
I think she has worse taste than me.

431
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:20,295
How could she despise my novel

432
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,775
even without reading it?

433
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:23,614
I'm telling you,

434
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,295
I'm fine if she insults me,

435
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,934
but she can never insult my book.

436
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:29,654
No.

437
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,414
She can't insult me either.

438
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,535
I don't agree with her.

439
00:21:36,414 --> 00:21:37,654
I think the book is nice.

440
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:40,174
May Time Flies

441
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:41,614
is a beautiful title.

442
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,815
No, it's not.

443
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:45,654
You're not allowed to read this.

444
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:47,815
Hey, give it to me.

445
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:48,495
Give it to me.

446
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:03,694
Don't you smirk.

447
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:05,055
Dear, please don't be sad.

448
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:05,735
I...

449
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,214
Blimey.

450
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,575
I'm sorry to interrupt.

451
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:19,174
I didn't know you can move on so fast.

452
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:22,174
Nonsense.

453
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:25,535
Who's he?

454
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:26,815
He...

455
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:28,654
Hello, I'm Wu Yu.

456
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:29,495
Wu Yu?

457
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:31,934
So, you're the male lead?

458
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:32,934
Nice to meet you.

459
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,055
I'm Zhou Xiaoyu.

460
00:22:34,174 --> 00:22:35,374
Just call me, Zhuang Yu.

461
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:40,295
Do we have guests?

462
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:41,335
Make yourself at home.

463
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:45,535
Come with me.

464
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:54,335
Who's that girl? What's going on now?

465
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:55,775
She's Professor Chen's daughter,

466
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:56,775
Chen Ruying.

467
00:22:58,374 --> 00:22:58,934
Is she

468
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,535
Wu Yu's childhood friend who passed away
last time?

469
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:01,055
Am I right?

470
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,015
What a clear mind you have.

471
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:07,374
But why is she here now?

472
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:10,015
Does your house become
the assembly point of the respawn?

473
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,134
Because we suspect

474
00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:14,855
that the murder of the arson case

475
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:16,855
and the serial killings

476
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:18,095
is Su Wan.

477
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:21,095
He is her fiance
in the previous timeline.

478
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:23,015
So, we take her here

479
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:25,055
and take care of her.

480
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:27,694
Do you want an apple?

481
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:30,414
Eat the apple.

482
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,295
But, I can tell this girl

483
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:35,735
is the typical troublesome
lady character in the novel.

484
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,095
You're going to suffer.

485
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:39,694
Can I talk to you now?

486
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,134
Yes.

487
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:41,974
Tan Jiao.

488
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,694
Can you please help me to find someone?

489
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:44,614
Who's it?

490
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:45,454
Shen Shiyan.

491
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:47,894
Why does he look for him?

492
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,414
I want to know
if Su Wan is related to these.

493
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:51,654
So, I need to make sure
if Professor and his wife's death

494
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,414
was accidental or a murder.

495
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:54,495
Okay.

496
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:55,454
I'll do it.

497
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:57,614
But,

498
00:23:58,174 --> 00:23:59,614
I need your help with another thing.

499
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,055
Sure.

500
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,660
(May Time Flies)

501
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,660
(Were all attracted by him,
the pitch black dense...)

502
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:22,174
Chen Ruying.

503
00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:23,974
Can you be quiet

504
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:25,374
while reading?

505
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:27,495
This novel is very interesting.

506
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:32,815
What are you doing?

507
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:39,614
Are you a writer?

508
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:43,535
Is the requirement that low
to become a writer now?

509
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:46,614
Even though I have yet
to read your story,

510
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:48,055
I'm sure

511
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,660
(May Time Flies)

512
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:52,775
you're no better than Qizhu.

513
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,335
Wonder what Brother Yu is doing now.

514
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,614
Why doesn't he send me a message?

515
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,654
I grew up together with Brother Yu.

516
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:09,535
(The turf is instantly ignited...)
I know I have a place in his heart.

517
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:11,575
He's blunt

518
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,414
and keeps his feelings

519
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:14,414
without expressing it.

520
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:16,495
But, concerning our relationship,

521
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:17,775
girls shouldn't take the first step

522
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:18,654
to confess, right?

523
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,735
You write romance stories, don't you?

524
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:24,575
Do you have any tricks

525
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:25,855
to teach me?

526
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:28,934
Anyway, trifling skills can
be of my help too.

527
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:31,735
Anything in mind?

528
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:34,855
I was thinking

529
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,095
how could you be so mean?

530
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,855
Hey.

531
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:40,934
You're so annoying.

532
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:42,374
Forget it.

533
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:45,575
Anyway, both of our family

534
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:46,535
have left us,

535
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:48,495
we're the only two lonely souls

536
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,134
in this world.

537
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,614
A single lady like you

538
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:55,495
can never fathom

539
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,735
the pain deep inside us.

540
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,174
Why are you in my bed?

541
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,095
I want to sleep.

542
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:02,454
You sleep on the sofa.

543
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:05,015
You!

544
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,295
You invited me here.

545
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,015
Yet you don't allow me

546
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:09,894
to sleep on the bed?

547
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:11,694
Get off the bed.

548
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:13,095
No one is allowed to sleep on my bed.

549
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:14,335
You sleep on the sofa.

550
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:15,815
Hurry up.

551
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:18,934
Oh, geez.

552
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:21,295
You're inconsiderate.

553
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:25,295
Alright, I'll sleep on the sofa.

554
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:25,855
My goodness.

555
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:27,454
You're so annoying.

556
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,174
How could I sleep on the sofa?

557
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:30,694
It's small.

558
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:34,174
What if I catch a cold

559
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,095
and my body gets pain later?

560
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,694
You're mean.

561
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:43,894
Why did I bring you home?

562
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:48,134
Quiet. I'm going to sleep now.

563
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:51,694
I'm telling you,

564
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:54,255
if you were a character in my story,

565
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,495
I'd make you perish before long.

566
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:09,055
No worries.

567
00:27:09,974 --> 00:27:10,775
I've already prepared

568
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:11,894
the present for Shen Shiyan.

569
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:13,335
Your mother is just incredible.

570
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:14,815
She even knows what he likes.

571
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,255
Alright, I'll hang up.

572
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:25,015
I didn't expect the police
to like trendy things

573
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,055
like garage kit.

574
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:45,214
Oh, gosh.

575
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:47,255
What do I do now?

576
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,295
Madam.

577
00:28:04,575 --> 00:28:05,654
The traffic light has turned red,

578
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:06,735
why didn't you pull the brake?

579
00:28:08,174 --> 00:28:08,894
I'm sorry.

580
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:10,174
It's my fault.
I take full responsibility.

581
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:10,815
Well.

582
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,174
May I have your contact?

583
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:14,454
I'm fine if you go for car insurance
or I pay for the maintenance.

584
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:15,974
Alright.

585
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:18,575
Drive carefully next time.

586
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:19,295
Sure.

587
00:28:20,454 --> 00:28:21,095
Give me a second.

588
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:48,855
I'll take full responsibility
for your car repair.

589
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,015
But could you sell
this garage kit to me?

590
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:53,815
I need it tomorrow for something urgent.

591
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:54,934
Please.

592
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,214
It's fine even if the price is high.

593
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:03,654
I'm sorry.

594
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:06,894
I can't sell it to you.

595
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,015
Perhaps this is the will of God.

596
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:14,575
I'm going to lose my loved one.

597
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:19,255
To be honest, I have many flaws

598
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:20,934
and troublesome.

599
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:24,495
Despite this, my boyfriend
loves me very much.

600
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:27,134
However, I didn't cherish him

601
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:28,775
and I always make him upset.

602
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,055
Now, he wants to break up with me.

603
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,654
I bought his favourite garage kit

604
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:37,575
as for a gift for him

605
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,654
making him stay.

606
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:39,974
But...

607
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:43,694
Perhaps this is the will of God.

608
00:29:54,855 --> 00:29:55,815
Take it.

609
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,134
Are you sure?

610
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:00,815
I'll pay you, okay?

611
00:30:00,974 --> 00:30:02,694
Drive carefully.

612
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,055
I wish you and your boyfriend happiness.

613
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:07,614
Thank you.

614
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,340
(Shen Shiyan)

615
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,580
(It was a long queue, but worth it.)

616
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:38,614
Sir.

617
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:39,855
Please help us.

618
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:40,735
No worries.

619
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:42,214
I'll seek help from my colleague
in Jinghai

620
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:43,855
to look into the death of
Professor Chen again.

621
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:45,654
I'll keep you informed.

622
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:46,735
Thank you.

623
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:48,174
Besides,

624
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:51,015
a car tried to hit us

625
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,614
at Road Kunming yesterday.

626
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:54,535
I wonder if this incident

627
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,214
has something to do with Su Wan.

628
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:57,855
No cameras along the road.

629
00:30:58,174 --> 00:30:59,575
Do you still remember the plate number?

630
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,095
Hai A87914.

631
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:11,855
Are you sure?

632
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,095
The car is registered at Jinghai.

633
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:17,735
I'll check it out.

634
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:22,934
Thank you so much, Officer Shen.

635
00:31:32,095 --> 00:31:32,855
Well...

636
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:34,454
What's wrong?

637
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:35,414
Nothing.

638
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:37,815
Well.

639
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:39,295
Why do I sense

640
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:40,694
that you're familiar with me?

641
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:48,255
Perhaps we were friends

642
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:49,855
in the past life.

643
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:53,055
Zhu.

644
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:54,134
I'm sorry for being late.

645
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,414
This is the present
you wanted to give Officer Shen.

646
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:57,694
My present?

647
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:01,974
It's you?

648
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:03,654
It turns out

649
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,134
I'm the windows to your soul.

650
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:09,735
I think it's God's plan.

651
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:11,495
Miss Zhou.

652
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,015
You violated the law and hit my car

653
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,295
and deceived the police.

654
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:15,495
It seems we should have a serious talk

655
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:17,775
about God's plan.

656
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,414
Why can't I drink?

657
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:21,214
What are you looking at?

658
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:22,414
Don't be a busybody.

659
00:32:24,614 --> 00:32:25,934
What are you looking at?

660
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:27,575
I...

661
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:28,934
How could you be rude to her?

662
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:29,694
Shut your trap.

663
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:33,174
You darned women.

664
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:34,495
Do you want to challenge me?

665
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:36,134
Do you?

666
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:39,174
You disturb the public order
and attempted to launch an assault

667
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,174
towards women...

668
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:41,654
I'm a young lady.

669
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:47,015
You attempted to assault a young lady.

670
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,095
Come with me.

671
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,335
Why should I listen to you?

672
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,614
It hurts.

673
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:52,495
Who's he?

674
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:54,295
He's my future son-in-law.

Third-level superintendent
of the Municipal Criminal Police Force,

676
00:32:57,214 --> 00:32:58,335
Shen Shiyan.

677
00:32:58,614 --> 00:32:59,934
How dare you pick a fight here?

678
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:00,775
- How dare you to beat women?
- I won't do that again.

679
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,335
I'm wrong.

680
00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:02,174
Do you want to challenge him?

681
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:03,454
Do you dare?

682
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:04,335
No.

683
00:33:04,454 --> 00:33:04,934
I don't dare.

684
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:05,894
You scoundrel.

685
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:22,575
I'm writing now.

686
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:23,614
Don't disturb me.

687
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:24,974
Are you sure?

688
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:25,894
I can tell

689
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:26,775
that something bothers you.

690
00:33:31,414 --> 00:33:34,255
You're really smart today.

691
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:35,815
It's obvious, isn't it?

692
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:41,295
Previously,

693
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:42,055
I thought

694
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,055
something has happened between
you and Brother Yu.

695
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:45,974
So, I was rude to you.

696
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:49,095
Please don't be angry with me.

697
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:53,214
Why?

698
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,575
What makes you change your mind?

699
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:58,535
Because you like someone else.

700
00:33:59,295 --> 00:33:59,934
Who's it?

701
00:34:00,735 --> 00:34:01,894
Apparently,

702
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:03,134
it's Shen Shiyan.

703
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:09,775
You're indeed smart.

704
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:10,855
I know.

705
00:34:12,374 --> 00:34:15,255
But, I want to remind you

706
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:17,974
that your friend, Zhuang Yu

707
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:21,615
isn't someone kind.

708
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,735
I don't like you badmouth my friend.

709
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,815
I tell you for your own good.

710
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:29,175
Didn't you

711
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,494
find out something?

712
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:31,815
Are you aware

713
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:34,215
that she has feelings
for Shen Shiyan too?

714
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:36,255
So what?

715
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:42,815
It's a serious problem,
why are you so calm?

716
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,655
Didn't you realise that your friend
wants to steal your man?

717
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:47,335
They kept looking at each other

718
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,135
when we were at the restaurant.

719
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:48,855
I really couldn't stand

720
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,094
the way they flirted with each other.

721
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:53,215
It's not what you thought.

722
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,295
Actually, Zhuang Yu...

723
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,494
You won't understand anyway.

724
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,454
You're so silly and cowardly.

725
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:00,615
Well, I can understand.

726
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:01,454
Judging you,

727
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:03,934
you don't have a good body shape

728
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,175
and you're boring as compared to her.

729
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:06,494
It's understandable if you lose to her.

730
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:08,534
However, since we live under one roof,

731
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,094
I must look out for you.

732
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:14,374
You're a writer.

733
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:16,494
You have to take the initiative
when it comes to relationships.

734
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:18,135
Otherwise, you can never be as good

735
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:19,494
as Master Qizhu.

736
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:22,255
Fine.

737
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:23,414
You won.

739
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:24,655
Well.

740
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:26,014
Can you please leave me alone?

741
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:27,054
You stay here.

742
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:27,494
See you.

743
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:29,894
I'm serious about this.

744
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:31,255
Annoying.

745
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:34,335
Silly girl.

746
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:35,014
Geez.

747
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:37,014
How come she didn't realise the problem?

748
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:38,974
She should accept my kindness.

Hi, sir.

753
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:21,135
A car was about to hit us

754
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,775
at the junction the day before.

755
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:23,974
Do you still remember that?

756
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:25,494
Yes.

757
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,655
Do you know this person?
Or have you seen this person before?

I don't know this person.

759
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,655
Many people come in and out here.

760
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:31,815
I can't recognise him.

761
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:33,335
I don't know him.

762
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:34,655
Thank you.

No.

Please look carefully.

No.

Brother Yu.

771
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,974
None of the people has seen him.

772
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:52,615
Su Wan is so cunning.

773
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:54,175
It's fine.

774
00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:56,014
If the driver is Su Wan,

775
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:57,655
someone must've seen him.

776
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:00,655
Are you sure it was Su Wan?

777
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:03,974
What's his motive?

778
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:04,894
Not all criminals

779
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:06,215
have a motive to commit the crime.

780
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:08,135
Perhaps he's a psychopath.

781
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,454
Back then, he was fond of me

782
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:11,934
and kept pestering me.

783
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:14,135
But, I only like Brother Yu.

784
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:15,775
I always gave him the cold shoulder.

785

Don't look back.

00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:38,374
is the 19th of August.

844
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:39,295
I know.

845
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:40,855
It means

846
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:42,974
that our time has moved backwards.

847
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,295
Do you think

848
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:46,414
time will keep on moving backwards?

849
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,494
If so, we can change what has happened

850
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,175
and save Miao.

851
00:41:00,454 --> 00:41:01,215
But,

852
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,855
how can we get back to the cruise?

853
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:09,255
How can we go back in time again?

854
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,374
So, we need to find out

855
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,615
a way to trigger time travel.

856
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,255
Normally, natural phenomena

857
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:18,295
have their own condition and pattern.

858
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:20,295
Let's think carefully

859
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,534
about what we did

860
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:23,974
before the time travel last time.

861
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:26,014
Do we have to repeat the same action

862
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:28,014
to trigger time travel?

863
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:30,934
Before we went go back in time
last time,

864
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:33,655
we fought.

865
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:39,934
Is it because of the fall?

866
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,815
I think the time was messed up

867
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:44,135
because we fell last time.

868
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:45,655
It's the kiss.

869
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:46,775
That's right.

870
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,215
Let's try again.

871
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:01,414
I'm fine with that.

872
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:05,494
Good, then.

873
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:29,215
Normally, people close their eyes

874
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:31,215
when they kiss.

875
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:33,374
Let's try it with our eyes closed.

876
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:34,014
Okay.

877
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:35,494
Give me your hand.

878
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:40,494
Okay.

879
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:42,255
I'm ready.

880
00:42:43,534 --> 00:42:45,454
You do it like
you're sacrificing yourself.

881
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:47,014
I...

882
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:48,934
Nonsense.

883
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:54,215
Apparently, you're more nervous than me.

884
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,215
Your hands are sweating.

885
00:42:58,215 --> 00:42:59,014
Relax.

886
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,374
Anyway,

887
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:01,855
it's an experiment.

888
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:03,615
Don't feel any pressure.

889
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:04,775
Relax.

890
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:06,974
Let's start.

891
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:16,255
Hold on.

892
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,014
What if you managed to travel back
in time,

893
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:19,974
but I stay here?

894
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:22,014
Or it goes the other way round

895
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:22,815
which you stay here.

896
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:23,695
What do we do?

897
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:25,615
No matter where I go,

898
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,014
I'll find you.

899

Miss Zhou.

Please drive carefully.

I'm a dangerous driver.

What if

927
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,695
I have an accident again later?

928
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:02,894
Will there be any men

929
00:45:02,894 --> 00:45:04,135
to help me?

930
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:05,414
Wouldn't you know it?

931
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:06,695
Hang on.

932
00:45:07,974 --> 00:45:08,735
Why?

933
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:16,574
What are you doing?

934
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:18,175
Didn't you ask me to leave?

935
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:19,934
Are you arresting me?

936
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:20,815
What are you up to?

937
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:22,974
What's wrong with you?

938
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:23,534
You're so...

939
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:24,615
Adjust the driver's seat.

940
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:50,655
I'm off today.

941
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:52,255
I can help to train your driving skill.

942
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,094
Drive.

943
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:27,054
Pay attention to the rear-view mirror.

944
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,815
Accidents are most likely to happen

945
00:46:29,815 --> 00:46:31,054
when a car overtakes another car
on the road.

946
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,974
Why didn't you use turn signals
before changing lanes?

947
00:46:35,974 --> 00:46:37,255
It's dangerous.

948
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:41,215
There is no car on the road though.

949
00:46:43,894 --> 00:46:45,215
You need good driving habits

950
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:46,934
to deal with complex road conditions

951
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:48,054
and unknown accidents calmly.

952
00:46:49,255 --> 00:46:50,414
Being a good driver,

953
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:52,695
you must obey rules

954
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:53,695
and pay attention to details
while driving.

955
00:46:55,054 --> 00:46:55,894
There's a junction ahead.

956
00:46:55,974 --> 00:46:57,014
Slow down the car ahead of time.

957
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:58,295
(So,)

958

962
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,054
Why are you looking at me? Eyes ahead.

963
00:47:11,215 --> 00:47:13,175
Is there something on my face?

964
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:13,855
No.

965
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:15,014
No, it's not.

966
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:16,775

967
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:19,054
Did you work a part-time job too?

00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:21,175
What do you mean?

969
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,695
Judging your teaching,

970
00:47:22,855 --> 00:47:23,655
you must be

971
00:47:23,655 --> 00:47:25,135
a skilled driving instructor, right?

972
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:30,855
Eyes ahead.

973
00:47:31,335 --> 00:47:33,374
Observe the lane next to you
before you overtake.

974
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:35,014
Don't play a fool

975
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:39,094
The speed limit is 40. Overspeed.

976
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:41,094
I shouldn't have come.

977
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:43,974
Shen Shiyan, you're such a blunt guy.

978

The fifth driving guideline.

979
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:48,014
Use turn signals properly.

980
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:49,615
Switching the turn signals
according to your needs.

981
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:55,374

and teach me on the spot, did you?
