how many girls they've cheated.

172
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,136
Of course,

173
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:18,896
you're not one of those girls.

174
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:21,136
You let your guard down in a moment.

175
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,457
He's not worth being your male lead,

176
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,896
and for you to be this sad.

177
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:27,297
I can't believe this.

178
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:28,856
But...

179
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:32,896
Ms. Feng?

180
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,057
Ms. Feng.

181
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:40,937
Hello, Miss Tan.

182
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,016
Who is this?

183
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:44,656
I'm Chen Ruying's mother.

184
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:48,496
The mistress' mom is here to see you?

185
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,337
I was the one who texted you yesterday.

186
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:54,297
I'm a straightforward person.

187
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,016
I'm sure you already know

188
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:58,136
that

189
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,297
Ying and Wu Yu will marry
after two weeks.

190
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,376
It's inconvenient to talk here.

191
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,896
I'd like to invite you
for a meal at home.

192
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,577
At the same time, you can talk to Wu Yu.

193
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,417
Ms. Feng, can you tell me

194
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,817
the date of the wedding?

195
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,376
January 25th.

196
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:17,097
January 25th?

197
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:20,817
Would you like to come?

198
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:26,337
Yes.

199
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,016
Just go.

200
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,736
Don't be scared. I'll go with you.

201
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,577
(Zhuang Yu)
(What's her background?)

202
00:15:58,297 --> 00:16:00,016
(An executive
of a public-listed company.)

203
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:01,856
(The wife of Wu Yu's mentor.)

204
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,697
You've got to be kidding me.

205
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:29,217
I'm feeling overwhelmed

206
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,457
by all these luxurious surroundings.

207
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,616
So that's her?

208
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:52,376
What's wrong with you?

209
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,417
You're shameless enough
to come to my house.

210
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:56,896
So are you saying
a mistress can speak recklessly?

211
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,217
That's a bit rich coming from you

212
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,457
when you're the shameless one.

213
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,817
Don't you have any principles at all?

214
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:02,817
Who are you calling a mistress?

215
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:03,977
You're

216
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:05,457
fat and rude.

217
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,217
Me? Fat?

218
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,617
What's your problem, huh?

219
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,576
I can let it go that you're clingy.

220
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,177
You even brought your sturdy friend

221
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,576
to make a scene at my house.

222
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,496
No wonder Wu Yu dislikes you.

223
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,377
Ying,

224
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,217
don't be rude to my guests.

225
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:20,137
Mom,

226
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:21,816
she's your guest?

227
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,217
Don't you know who she is?

228
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:23,897
Am I fat?

229
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,177
We met Miss Tan on the cruise.

230
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:28,336
I ran into her at the hotel.

231
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,857
So I invited her home.

232
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:30,697
Is that wrong?

233
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,977
You knew she was Wu Yu's...

234
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,296
I know.

235
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:35,096
But...

236
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,536
But she's a bad person.

237
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:37,137
Stop it.

238
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:38,217
Go back to your room.

239
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,576
I have important matters
to talk to her about.

240
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:41,697
You're just asking for trouble.

241
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:43,657
I said keep quiet and go to your room.

242
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:53,217
Are you okay?

243
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:53,776
I'm okay.

244
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:54,857
This wretched girl!

245
00:17:58,296 --> 00:17:58,857
Are you all right?

246
00:17:58,857 --> 00:17:59,697
I'm fine.

247
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:00,977
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,296
She's being insensible.

249
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:03,697
It's all right.

250
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,536
Why don't you spend the night here?

251
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:06,457
I'll make the arrangement.

252
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:07,457
It's okay.

253
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:09,177
We don't dare to accept.

254
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:10,536
I'm afraid your daughter

255
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,217
would explode with anger.

256
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:11,776
Okay.

257
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,536
I'll leave it to you, Ms. Feng.

258
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,016
Are you out of your mind?

259
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,177
She's driving me up the wall!

260
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,417
Why do you want to spend the night here?

261
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:21,897
I don't want to stay here
even for a minute.

262
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:23,417
That woman called me sturdy

263
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:24,177
and fat!

264
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:25,776
What is she?

265
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,177
A junior from his childhood.

266
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,137
Childhood friend?

267
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:30,697
So what if she's his childhood friend?

268
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:31,776
Even the junior
in "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer"

269
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,096
didn't end up with the male lead.

270
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,217
Her father is Wu Yu's doctoral advisor.

271
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:37,217
So what?

272
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,417
Even so, he can't treat you like this.

273
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,897
I'll write about them in my novel

274
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:41,056
and upload it online.

275
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:43,657
One isn't enough for you.

276
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,056
You're right.

277
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:46,857
I'm going to turn them into a series.

278
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:48,857
I'll make them
a part of literary history

279
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:49,977
for research topics.

280
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:51,697
So our future generations would study

281
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,457
and criticize them.

282
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,137
You just want to be recorded
in literary history, right?

283
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:57,697
Why aren't you upset at all?

284
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:59,056
They were so mean to you.

285
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:01,657
I think

286
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,096
Wu Yu has his difficulties.

287
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,776
My dear,

288
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:11,937
don't tell me you fell for his lies.

289
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,217
Come here.

290
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:18,977
Sit down.

291
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:19,776
Sit.

292
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,056
Actually,

293
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,977
I have something to tell you.

294
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,776
Don't tell me

295
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,977
he has suffered emotional trauma

296
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,457
and you were his only true love.

297
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:34,056
Or his family

298
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,217
is filthy rich.

299
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,096
I've traveled through time.

300
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,536
You scared me.

301
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:40,457
I knew you wouldn't fall into such...

302
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:43,217
What did you say?

303
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:47,096
I traveled through time.

304
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:48,776
And

305
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,336
it's not the first time.

306
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:11,937
Yu,

307
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:14,897
you're going

308
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:17,697
to believe me again this time,

309
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:18,576
right?

310
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,417
Of course, I'll believe you.

311
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,137
Judging from what you told me,

312
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:25,417
he made a pledge

313
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,697
as he confessed to you on the cruise.

314
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,336
But he's marrying Chen Ruying
after that.

315
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,457
Wu Yu would never marry

316
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:32,977
at this time.

317
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:35,377
What's wrong with marrying at this time?

318
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:37,056
I've searched online.

319
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:39,417
In this space and time,

320
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,617
Wu Miao is still missing,

321
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,657
and her life is still uncertain.

322
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:44,336
Even if...

323
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,217
Even if he had fallen in love
with Chen Ruying,

324
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,816
he wouldn't marry

325
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:49,697
at this time.

326
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:51,536
Also,

327
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,256
according to the time-crossing rule
we established,

328
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,457
we would only stay 15 days.

329
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,496
That means

330
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:58,177
our next time travel date

331
00:20:58,177 --> 00:20:59,536
would be January 24th.

332
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:00,617
So how can he marry

333
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,256
on January 25th?

334
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:03,096
Am I right?

335
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:07,056
That means

336
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,056
something is definitely wrong here.

337
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,096
You're right about that.

338
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:19,417
Coming.

339
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:24,937
Miss Tan.

340
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:26,617
I have something to discuss with you.

341
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:27,457
Are you free now?

342
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,377
I need your help

343
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,336
to stop Ying and Yu's wedding.

344
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:35,536
No matter what, I'll never allow

345
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,417
Ying to marry a man
who doesn't love her.

346
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,217
I saw how you reacted
at the hotel today.

347
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,377
I think

348
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:47,177
we have the same idea

349
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:48,457
about their wedding.

350
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:50,056
Miss Tan,

351
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:51,457
I need your help,

352
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:52,937
and you need mine too.

353
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:56,857
Okay.

354
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,736
I look forward to working with you.

355
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:00,016
Please be my guest for dinner tonight.

356
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,177
Be sure to come.

357
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:09,697
Could it be a trap?

358
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:16,617
Mom had gone too far.

359
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:19,137
Wu Yu.

360
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:21,137
What's the matter, Ying?

361
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:22,496
Dad,

362
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:24,096
you have to control her.

363
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,937
She...

364
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:29,096
She brought Tan Jiao home.

365
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:30,657
She was so unreasonable

366
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:31,697
and kept criticizing me.

367
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:32,937
Mom even defended her

368
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,296
and said she was a guest.

369
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,177
I think

370
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,897
she's here to ruin

371
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,496
my wedding with Wu Yu.

372
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:40,056
Tan Jiao is here?

373
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:42,897
She even brought her friend
to make a scene here.

374
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,736
Wu Yu,

375
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,897
you should've seen
how fierce she was just now.

376
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:47,736
Dad,

377
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:48,897
you must chase them out.

378
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:50,816
I don't want them to show up
at the wedding.

379
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,096
Calm down.

380
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:53,336
I'll ask your mom about it later.

381
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:54,977
Dad.

382
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:00,336
How about this?

383
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:01,536
Let's have dinner first.

384
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,657
We'll talk about it after dinner.

385
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:05,336
Wu Yu, come and join us.

386
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:07,137
Okay.

387
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:08,776
Let's eat

388
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,377
and talk later. Okay?

389
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:12,736
You need to change your temper.

390
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,096
(You shouldn't have come.)

391
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:34,177
Quickly now.

392
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:35,457
You're all here.

393
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:36,217
Come on.

394
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:37,857
Take your seat at the dining table.

395
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:39,377
Come and take your seat.

396
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,137
It's my family dinner.

397
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:00,617
You're pretty shameless to be here.

398
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:01,457
Ying.

399
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:03,617
You're all guests.

400
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,177
Please raise your glasses.

401
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:10,336
Ms. Feng,

402
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:12,457
sorry I'm late.

403
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,056
It's okay. Take your seat.

404
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,100
(Su Wan, Feng Group's
Secretary of the Board and CFO)

405
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,336
(In the previous timeline,)

406
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:29,897
(it was clearly Su Wan)

407
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:31,096
(who married Chen Ruying.)

408
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,377
Professor Chen.

409

(After Professor Chen, Feng Yan,)

410

(and Chen Ruying met
with their misfortune,)

411
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:37,336
(he mysteriously disappeared.)

412
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,417
How ridiculous.

413
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:39,496
It was a family dinner.

414
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:42,016
Yet, there are
so many hateful freeloaders here.

415
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:44,296
I feel embarrassed to freeload too.

416
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:45,776
So

417
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,417
I came with good news today.

418
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:48,617
Ms. Feng,

419
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,217
we've just received news today.

420
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:52,377
Our company will be listed soon.

421
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:53,857
That's great.

422
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,937
Su Wan, you've done a really good job.

423
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:57,937
Ms. Feng,

424
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,977
you're treating me like an outsider.

425
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:01,776
You always treat me
like a family member.

426
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:03,417
I ought to do these.

427
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,217
See how good he is?

428
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:06,417
There's one more thing.

429
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:13,816
Ying,

430
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:16,977
I know we're...

431
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:23,016
In any case,

432
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,457
I hope both of you will be happy.

433
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,816
It's a small gift I prepared for you.

434
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,256
I hope you'll like it.

435
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,576
Stop being pretentious.

436
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:35,336
(He has pretty high EQ.)

437
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:38,296
(Su Wan seems to be polite)

438
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:39,256
(and a capable person.)

439
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:40,977
Let's start eating.

440
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:41,937
Help yourselves.

441
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:42,457
Here.

442
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:43,617
Su Wan.

443
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:47,256
Su Wan.

444
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:49,137
Let me introduce you

445
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:51,417
to Tan Jiao and her best friend.

446
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:52,897
They're also guests here.

447
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:53,536
Hello.

448
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:56,296
I heard of Tan Jiao.

449
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:57,776
You're

450
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:00,256
Wu Yu's good friend,

451
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:01,296
right?

452
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,336
So are you in Jinghai

453
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,977
to attend their wedding?

454
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:08,177
They're not that close.

455
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,697
We don't plan to invite her.

456
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:11,536
Wu Yu,

457
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,496
let me get you some food.

458
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,336
What are you doing?

459
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,617
Nothing.

460
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,536
I'm just helping myself with this phony.

461
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,617
I mean, cabbage.

462
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:21,857
Mom,

463
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:23,137
she's snatching my food.

464
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:23,857
Miss Tan,

465
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,457
please eat more.

466
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:26,457
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

467
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:28,217
It's just a dish.

468
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,897
You can have it if you want.

469
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:30,937
I don't mind.

470
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:34,177
But if you really snatched something

471
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:36,697
and told everyone about it,

472
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:38,977
that would be funny.

473
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:39,977
Right?

474
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,417
What do you mean?

475
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:43,457
Wu Yu,

476
00:26:43,457 --> 00:26:44,417
look at her.

477
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:55,937
Mr. Su,

478
00:26:56,256 --> 00:26:58,296
you're a graduate
of the Faculty of Chemistry,

479
00:26:58,296 --> 00:26:59,177
Jinghai University, right?

480
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,377
Yes.

481
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:01,536
My sister too.

482
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,177
That means you're her senior.

483
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:09,336
Yes.

484
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:11,296
I'm sorry

485
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:12,617
about your sister.

486
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:14,056
How about this?

487
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:15,617
Let's exchange our contact.

488
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,016
If you need any help,

489
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,296
you can call me anytime.

490
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:20,417
Wu Yu, ignore him.

491
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,296
He's not a good person.

492
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:22,897
Ying!

493
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:24,377
Where are your manners?

494
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:25,496
It's okay.

495
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:26,937
You're all picking on me!

496
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,056
I'm leaving.

497
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:31,617
I'll go and check on her.

498
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,697
See how much you've spoiled her?

499
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:41,217
Let her be.

500
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,056
Let's continue with our dinner.

501
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,377
Dinner didn't go well as expected.

502
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:57,977
The whole family is weird.

503
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:01,217
I'm sure Wu Yu is probing something.

504
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:08,736
I'll leave you two alone, then.

505
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,056
Tell me.

506
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:39,937
Why are you marrying Chen Ruying?

507

(January 10th. Monday. Laba Festival)

508

I'm back to six months ago.

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,020
(Wu Miao's disappearance is confirmed
to be done by Jinghai's serial killer.)

510
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,980
(Wu Miao is still missing,
and no body was found.)

511
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,340
(Cyanide was detected
in the serial murder's first victim.)

512
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,576
(The outcome still hasn't changed.)

513
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,045
(Su Wan, Faculty of Chemistry,
Jinghai University Graduate.)

514
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:54,900
(Feng Group's Secretary of
the Board and CFO)

515
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,220
(Work Experience)

516
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:07,096
You were very rude to Su Wan just now.

517
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:09,016
I'll never marry him.

518
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:10,736
He loves you very much.

519
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:11,857
But I don't love him.

520
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:12,576
You knew

521
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:14,016
I liked Wu Yu since young.

522
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:16,296
Yu only treats you as a younger sister.

523
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:18,137
He'll fall in love with me.

524
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:20,256
I'll never marry anyone
except Wu Yu.

525
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,697
Su Wan has a great personality
and is highly educated.

526
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:25,177
I know him very well
after working for me for years.

527
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,096
He's the right person for you.

528
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:28,056
Mom,

529
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,096
I'm your daughter, not your employee.

530
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:33,296
I think you need to calm down.

531
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:50,457
So

532
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:52,576
you heard it.

533
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:03,417
They never care

534
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,576
about what I think.

535
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:05,617
They always want me

536
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:07,217
to follow everything
they've planned for me.

537
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:08,816
Have you talked

538
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:11,336
to your mom about it?

539
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:13,417
She loves you very much, you know?

540
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:15,736
If you try and talk to her,

541
00:31:16,296 --> 00:31:17,617
I'm sure she'll understand you.

542
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:18,536
But she had never tried

543
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:20,457
to understand me since I was young.

544
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,496
She even set

545
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,697
the wedding date.

546
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:29,377
When is that?

547
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,137
January 22nd.

548
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:46,457
Professor.

549
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,096
Wu Yu, perfect timing.

550
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,296
I happen to be preparing
my lesson plan for next semester.

551
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:53,016
Can you take a look at it?

552
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:53,576
Professor,

553
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:55,217
do you still remember

554
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:56,377
what I told you on the cruise ship?

555
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,536
Changing the future
through time traveling

556
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:00,937
and...

557
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:07,697
I...

558
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:09,736
Why can't I recall anything?

559
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:10,937
It's not just us.

560
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:12,657
I've come into contact
with those on the cruise.

561
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,177
They've lost their memories too.

562
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:15,177
I think

563
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,657
there was a sudden crack
when quantum was stimulated

564
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:18,496
under high pressure,

565
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,096
which only brought back
limited information.

566
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,417
Also,

567
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:27,256
we must stop Ying and Su Wan
from getting married.

568
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:30,617
In the previous time and space,

569
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,056
a fire suddenly broke out

570
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,576
during Ying and Su Wan's wedding

571
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,377
on January 22nd.

572
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,977
Su Wan disappeared after that.

573
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:37,816
Later,

574
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:39,296
Ying found potassium cyanide

575
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,417
at Su Wan's house.

576
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:43,536
Professor.

577
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:45,056
I may not have any evidence.

578
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,816
But I'm suspicious of Su Wan.

579
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:48,056
Please believe me.

580
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:54,697
I believe you.

581
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:57,417
Please help Ying.

582
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,900
(No Subject)

583
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:13,617
(Wu Miao is in my hands.)

584
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,096
(If you want to save her,)

585
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:16,776
(marry Chen Ruying.)

586
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:23,496
So

587
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,296
you agreed to marry Chen Ruying

588
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:27,536
and postpone the wedding date

589
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:29,056
to January 25th

590
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,536
because you knew we wouldn't be here

591
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:32,977
as we'll be crossing again.

592
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:36,736
I treat Ying like my sister.

593
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:39,256
I'd never marry her.

594
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:40,657
But I must stop

595
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:42,457
the incident on January 22nd.

596
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,536
Professor will help us out.

597
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:48,496
But no matter what,

598
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:51,177
you should've told me.

599
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:56,776
I'm sorry.

600
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,417
I didn't want you
to get involved in this.

601
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:03,016
You were attacked several times.

602
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:05,137
I don't think he's only targeting Miao.

603
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:06,736
He's also targeting you.
