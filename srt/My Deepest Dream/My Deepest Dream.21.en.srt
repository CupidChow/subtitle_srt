at work at the bar.

173
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,826
It's Tan Jiao I'm worried about.

174
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,347
Get over there now then.

175
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:47,826
I'll go to the bar and keep an eye on
Xu Jingmiao for you.

176
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:48,906
Okay, thanks.

177
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,066
Chen Xingjian.

178
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:22,507
Tan Jiao?

179
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:24,867
What a coincidence.

180
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,867
Did you come here alone today?

181
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,267
Haven't you always wanted to kill me?

182
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,387
I'm not interested.

183
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:37,826
Bye.

184
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,347
Hold on!

185
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,347
How many times
do you want me to say it

186
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:47,467
before you can give up?

187
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:49,786
I killed Zhou Xiaoyu.

188
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,066
Chen Ningmeng,
Liu Xiaojiang and Ye Xunyi

189
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,107
were killed by me too.

190
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:53,826
However,

191
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:57,387
do you have any proof?

192
00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,666
Even if you got lucky
and got away with it,

193
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,627
the feeling of
being watched closely everyday

194
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:04,907
must be upsetting you, right?

195
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,947
As a law-abiding citizen,

196
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:12,586
I should thank the police

197
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,586
for keeping me protected all the time.

198
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:18,987
Have you been asking me

199
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:20,346
how I know that

200
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:21,907
you were planning to kidnap Xu Jingmiao?

201
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:25,146
Not only do I know

202
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,227
when you're going to kill them,

203
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:29,386
I also know

204
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:31,106
how you're going to kill them.

205
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,467
That's not exactly a secret.

206
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,667
You had planned

207
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,707
to kidnap Xu Jingmiao and kill her

208
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:43,386
in the early hours of the 24th.

209
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:44,626
You planned to dispose of
her body three days later.

210
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:47,907
You've inspected the place

211
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,866
where you would dump her body.

212
00:17:51,507 --> 00:17:52,707
It's the third trash can

213
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:54,467
in Forest Park.

214
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,826
I'm right, aren't I?

215
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,467
You are determined

216
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,947
to kill Xu Jingmiao, aren't you?

217
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,427
But I want to tell you that

218
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:07,066
as long as I am here,

219
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,546
I will know everything

220
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,866
you are planning to do.

221
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:10,747
And all of your plans

222
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,427
will never work!

223
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,826
Do you know you will die this time then?

224
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:17,626
Let me go.

225
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:18,747
I will kill you!

226
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:39,306
So, this is what you planned to do?

227
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,027
Trying to provoke me to kill you?

228
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:46,826
And let that thing record it

229
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,707
and make it an evidence?

230
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:49,626
Right?

231
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,626
I was just joking around.

232
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,306
How would a kind man like me

233
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:00,707
kill anyone?

234
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:16,386
You

235
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:19,947
are so silly and cute.

236
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,066
When you visit Zhou Xiaoyu's grave,

237
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:25,947
don't forget to invite me.

238
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,106
I don't have time to look for evidence!

239
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:31,786
What are you doing?

240
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:32,546
You can't go!

241
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,707
I have to catch you!

242
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:34,227
Are you insane?

243
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:34,626
Stop!

244
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,306
I'm running out of time!

245
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:40,866
Wu Yu...

246
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:43,146
- Wu Yu...
- Tan Jiao!

247
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:44,306
- Let go of me!
- Tan Jiao!

248
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,747
- Give me the knife!
- Let go!

249
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:47,507
Tan Jiao, give me the knife.

250
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:48,866
Zhou Xiaoyu won't let you do this.

251
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:49,826
Put down the knife.

252
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,707
You're willing to sacrifice yourself
just to put me in jail.

253
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:59,947
But you should
at least do it in a smart way,

254
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:00,626
okay?

255
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:05,227
I have to go.

256
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,386
Bye.

257
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:10,467
You can't go, Chen Xingjian.

258
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:11,786
You can't go.

259
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,707
You can't go, Chen Xingjian!

260
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,667
Let go of me, Wu Yu.

261
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,427
We are running out of time!

262
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:19,747
If I don't catch him
and put him in jail,

263
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,227
after we leave,

264
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,786
Wu Miao will still be dead!

265
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,826
Let go!

266
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,027
Calm down.

267
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:28,346
Calm down, will you?

268
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:30,267
I can't stay calm!

269
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:32,386
Wu Yu,

270
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,066
do you know that

271
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,306
if I had been smarter back then...

272
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:37,546
If I had been smarter

273
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,306
and figured out what Xiaoyu
was trying to tell me,

274
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,626
I would've been the one who went in.

275
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:41,667
I would've been the one who died,

276
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,066
not Xiaoyu.

277
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:45,987
She died in my place, you know?

278
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:46,947
Wu Yu...

279
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,866
What should I do?

280
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,386
Do you know that

281
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:02,106
whenever I close my eyes now,

282
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:04,187
all I can see is

283
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:06,987
the image of Yu lying cold in bed?

284
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,586
I can't get it out of my mind,

285
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,227
Wu Yu.

286
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,826
It's all I can see.

287
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,106
You should have said it out sooner.

288
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:23,747
You will feel better now.

289
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:25,507
But Wu Yu,

290
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:29,106
are we just going

291
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:31,947
to let the bad guys
get away with it like this?

292
00:21:33,106 --> 00:21:33,707
He will

293
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:35,507
continue to kill.

294
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:36,626
No, we are not.

295
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:39,386
We are not.

296
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:42,306
But anger and hatred

297
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:43,626
won't solve the problem.

298
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,866
And God

299
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:47,866
has given us the opportunity
again and again,

300
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,747
which means it's not too late.

301
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:52,106
If we look carefully,

302
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:53,987
we will be able to catch him

303
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:55,866
and save the ones we love.

304
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:58,146
You taught me that.

305
00:21:58,626 --> 00:21:59,546
Have you forgotten it?

306
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:06,146
But...

307
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:10,626
But I still miss her so much.

308
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:53,586
Here, have some warm water.

309
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,187
I will answer the door.

310
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:11,826
Is this Mr. Wu Yu?

311
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:12,907
Here's your expedited delivery.

312
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,507
It's mine?

313
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,190
(Ultrasonic Flash Delivery)

314
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:18,826
Alright, thank you.

315
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:52,907
Hi, Wu Yu.

316
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:54,507
Hello.

317
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:56,947
You are so clever.

318
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:58,786
I didn't expect

319
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,826
you'd figure out I'd continue
to go after Xu Jingmiao.

320
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:04,546
If you hadn't gone
to find Tan Jiao that day,

321
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,066
maybe you would've caught me red-handed.

322
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:15,306
You've ruined my perfect plans

323
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,106
again and again.

324
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,866
I'm really angry.

325
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:20,427
So, this time,

326
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:21,227
I want to challenge you

327
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,546
fair and square.

328
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:30,707
This woman

329
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:33,306
has only 24 hours to live.

330
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,306
If you want to save her,

331
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:38,626
come find me.

332
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:41,306
By the way,

333
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,866
I heard that you are able to predict

334
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,507
every move I make.

335
00:24:47,507 --> 00:24:49,826
Guess where I am then.

336
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:01,306
You have 24 hours.

337
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,546
I will be where I should be.

338
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,546
I'm waiting for you.

339
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,386
He just said

340
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,146
you almost caught him yesterday.

341
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,306
What does that mean?

342
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:25,586
Nothing.

343
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,987
Is it true that
if I hadn't gone yesterday,

344
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:32,546
you would have gotten the evidence?

345
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:38,146
Don't listen to him.

346
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:39,386
He said that on purpose.

347
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:41,626
He's trying to mess with my emotions.

348
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,306
All this time, you and Shen Shiyan

349
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:46,707
have been making a real effort.

350
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:51,467
I'm the only one

351
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,066
who has been useless.

352
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,826
Chen Xingjian revealed his true colors,

353
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,546
that means what you said
to him yesterday

354
00:26:09,386 --> 00:26:10,667
has got into his head.

355
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,106
He has decided to go all in.

356
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:18,027
You did a good job.

357
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:20,187
Leave the rest

358
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,227
to me and Shen Shiyan.

359
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,866
I will catch him

360
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,507
and avenge Zhou Xiaoyu.

361
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,667
Based on the time given by the suspect,

362
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:42,467
there are less than 20 hours left.

363
00:26:42,947 --> 00:26:44,267
Would he really keep Xu Jingmiao alive

364
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,786
for twenty-four hours?

365
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:47,826
Or is he just playing us?

366
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,786
Trying to make us work for nothing?

367
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:53,306
No.

368
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,826
That won't give him much pleasure.

369
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:57,626
What he wants is to defeat us.

370
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:58,707
He wants to see us fail,

371
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:01,586
and then, he will kill
Xu Jingmiao as planned.

372
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:03,106
It will be his trophy.

373
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,947
What is the place he said he should be?

374
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,187
If that is a hint,

375
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:10,586
that means he assumes
that you should know.

376
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:11,866
Miss Tan,

377
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:13,826
didn't you say

378
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:15,386
Chen Xingjian would

379
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,786
continue to kill in the future?

380
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:18,546
I don't care if it's real or not.

381
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:19,586
What do you think

382
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,267
is the pattern of

383
00:27:21,747 --> 00:27:24,027
the victims, time, and location
of these cases

384
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:24,866
that have occurred?

385
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,386
These are
where the four girls were killed.

386
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,907
The pattern of this is...

387
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:37,507
It's close to their homes.

388
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:40,027
Could the location

389
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,427
where he said he should be

390
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,626
connected to home?

391
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:45,907
We have set up tight security

392
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,306
near the homes of the four victims,

393
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,786
and began to search the nearby motels,

394
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:51,786
abandoned warehouses and alleys.

395
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,106
Under such circumstances,

396
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,707
it's impossible

397
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:56,907
to hide a living person.

Okay.

Wu Yu,

419
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:44,626
I said I'd help you

420
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:47,306
catch him.

421
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,187
You've helped me every time before.

422
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:53,386
This time, please believe me,

423
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,707
I will catch Chen Xingjian.

424
00:30:59,306 --> 00:31:01,146
I will bring Xiaoyu back to you.

425
00:31:02,907 --> 00:31:03,987
Wu Yu, you know,

426
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:08,267
I always believed that

427
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,546
I would be able to help more people

428
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,106
as a police officer,

429
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,227
but I never imagined

430
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:21,507
that my loved one

431
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,786
would die in front of me

432
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:24,267
one day,

433
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,586
and I couldn't do anything about it.

434
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,546
I have to withdraw myself from the case.

435
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,227
This is my duty as

436
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,786
a police officer,

437
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:39,106
but my duty to Xiaoyu,

438
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:41,467
I...

439
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,227
Shen Shiyan,

440
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,826
you're a great cop.

441
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:46,826
What Xiaoyu admired the most

442
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:49,267
is your adherence to your principles.

443
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:51,227
You won't change.

444
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:54,066
I won't let her down.

445
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:57,507
And I won't let you down.

446
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,386
There are so many people in here.

447
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:17,626
Oh, the stench.

448
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,907
(Why did he spray perfume at that time?)

449
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,187
(Was he trying to cover up some smell?)

450
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:38,346
Chen Ningmeng's body

451
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:39,987
was found in a public restroom.

452
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:41,306
Liu Xiaojiang's body

453
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:42,747
was found in the sewer.

454
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:44,507
Ye Xunyi's body

455
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:46,346
was found in a garbage disposal plant.

456
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,106
Xu Jingmiao's body was supposed

457
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,467
to be found in a trash can
in Forest Park.

458
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,106
I remember he said in the video

459
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,306
that her life
isn't worth anything at all.

460
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,386
That means his hatred has grown deeper,

461
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:02,507
plus our interference.

462
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:04,346
This must be

463
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:06,346
an even dirtier place,

464
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:08,267
with an odor
that is difficult to conceal.

465
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:13,267
Captain Ding, look.

466
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:15,667
We've been focusing on

467
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,027
the crime scene's location connection,

468
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:17,907
but we've overlooked

469
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:19,227
the hidden inner
psychological connections.

470
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:21,146
He's not doing this for
the pleasure and thrill.

471
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,267
He wants vengeance.

472
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:24,907
So, he didn't just want to kill them,

473
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:26,907
he also wanted to humiliate them
as much as he could.

474
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,826
That's why the graves he chose for them

475
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,907
are extremely dirty and stinky,

476
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:33,027
such as trash can or sewer.

477
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:34,866
Then the only dirty place

478
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,987
left in this range is...

479
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:38,227
(The Old Town of District Kaifu in Jinghai)

480
