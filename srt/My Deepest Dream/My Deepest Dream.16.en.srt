I found a small stream in the forest

72

with fresh water.

73
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,387
I'll get some fresh water tomorrow.

74
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,147
It's dark now,
let's keep the fire burning.

75
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:27,827
It'll also be a signal
to the rescue team.

76
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:28,988
We don't know

77

when the rescue team will come,

78
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:32,108
but we should rest early.

80
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,027
there is only a tent.

81
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:36,548
It's all cleaned up inside.

82
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:37,827

83
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,347
guys will stay outside for the night.

00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,548
Okay.

Are you okay?

86
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:57,307
Why do we have

87
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,947
to cram into this tent?

88
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:01,827
Who knows what people
look like when they sleep?

89
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,267
What if someone grinds her teeth
when she sleeps?

90
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,748
What if someone sleepwalks?

91
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,988
Some people may appear to be decent,
but they may act indecently.

92
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:08,387
Who knows what will happen?

93
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:11,468
What are you doing?

94
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,228

Stop staring.

100
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:32,907
What are you afraid of?

101
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:34,467
Mosquitoes here are very poisonous.

102

she has been rescued
by others on the Diamond Star.

116

But she's alone now.

117
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:12,947
She must be really lonely.

118
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:14,267
Don't worry.

119
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,308
Although she is not with us,

120
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,868
at least she's safe.

121
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:20,868
What we have to do now

122
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:22,108
is to get well rested,

123
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,467
conserve our energy
and get in good shape.

124
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:25,788
Think about it,

125
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,748
when she sees you,

126
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:29,428
and you're looking

127

dispirited,

128
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:32,707
do you think it will make her happy?

129

Go on.

130
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:41,308
Go get some sleep in the tent.

131
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:42,267
It's warm there.

132
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:44,068
What about you?

133
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,587
I will stand guard.

134
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:19,507
You're still awake?

135
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:21,748
I couldn't sleep.

136
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:22,868
Sit here for a while then.

137
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:37,467
You should cover yourself too.

138
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,227
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:53,867
I put you in danger

140
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,428
because I got the wrong direction.

141
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,747
I should have known it was Xu.

142
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:00,747
It's not your fault.

143
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:03,348
No one could have imagined

144
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:05,747
that Chen Ruying
would stage that whole thing.

145
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,347
Although we couldn't find
the real murderer,

146
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,147
at least we stopped

147
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:13,347
the tragedy from happening.

148
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:16,347
So,

149
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,867
it wasn't Su Wan nor Xu.

150
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:21,708
But who gave Ying

151
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:23,028
Miao's photo then?

152
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,548
I will come after you.

153
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,508
It can't be him, can it?

154
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:40,627
What's wrong?

155
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,268
Nothing.

156
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:46,587
It's too windy out here.

157
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:47,947
Go back inside and rest.

158
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,467
We just brushed with death.

159
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,388
I don't want to be apart from you
even for a second.

160
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,947
If we take a good look around,

161
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:05,947
this island is actually quite beautiful.

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,959
Yeah.

163
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,987
I wish we could stay like this.

164
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,467
When everything is over,

165
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:18,467
we will.

166
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:22,747
Yes, we will.

167
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:43,388
Here, open your mouth.

168
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:53,988
It was so cold last night.

169
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,707
I couldn't sleep at all.

170
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,068
Stop whining.

171
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,388
You're the only one who woke up late.

172
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,827
Where are the others?

173
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,188
Yan Yuan and Zhu Jirui
went to collect firewood.

174
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:05,308
Take a bite.

175
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,107
Wu Yu,

176
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:13,188
I'm hungry.

177
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:14,867
Is there anything delicious I can eat?

178
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:17,987
Tan Jiao.

179
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:28,747
Is this even for human?

180
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:31,787
Where is your manner?

181
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:32,428
I... I...

182
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,108
It's one thing that you didn't
wash your face after you woke up.

183
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,148
You even squeezed between them.

184
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:40,467
Do I look really ugly now?

185
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,227
Not just ugly,

186
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:44,867
you look like a savage woman
in an isolated island.

187
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:48,987
She's close enough.

188
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:53,747
We have so little food.

189
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:54,747
How is this enough?

190
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:57,268
We've searched all over the beach.

191
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:58,827
That's all we have left.

192
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,548
Don't be discouraged, and don't give up.

193
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,068
I'm sure the rescue team
will be here soon.

194
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:12,827
I'll go into the forest
to get some dry wood,

195
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:14,788
and to find some food.

196
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:16,028
Wu Yu,

197
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,028
I will go with you.

198
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,308
Okay.

199
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:28,788
Zhou Wei,

200
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:30,668
let's go the beach
and see if we can find something.

201
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,347
Are these enough?

202
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:57,467
What's wrong?

203
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:03,387
Theoretically,

204
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,987
I should be able to see
the island I saw before.

205
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,428
Could it be that you can't see

206
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:10,467
because of the fog on the sea?

207
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:12,387
That's why the rescue team

208
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,668
couldn't get here for now?

209
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,148
Let's hope so.

210
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:18,308
Have you noticed that

211
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:19,948
every time we travel
to a different time,

212
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:21,707
the people we met are all
on this island?

213
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:23,068
Yes.

214
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,107
Yan Yuan, Zhu Jirui,

215
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:27,867
Feng Yan, Chen Ruying,

216
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,507
even Zhu and Miao

217
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,788
became acquainted.

218
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,388
There is another thing.

219
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:37,627
What is it?

220
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:39,467
Actually, every time I come here,

221
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,707
I always have a vision.

222
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:43,268
And these visions

223
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,347
always come true in the end.

224
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:50,508
Wu Yu,

225
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,508
can I marry you?

226
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:57,987
I don't know why this is happening.

227
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:00,788
It's probably because
each time you come,

228
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,228
you happen to be a vector

229
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,747
connecting two unstable space and time.

230
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,268
What does that mean?

231
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,347
Time travel creates
quantum entanglement,

232
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,148
that's why you can see
pieces of the future.

233
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:11,987
This is a future quantum state event.

234
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:15,587
But I saw Zhou Wei this time.

235
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:17,068
Zhou Wei?

236
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:18,908
What was he doing?

237
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,707
I will come after you.

238
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:24,308
Could Zhou Wei be...

239
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,707
Wu Yu!

240
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:32,228
Wu Yu, Tan Jiao,

241
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:32,747
look.

242
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:33,908
We caught so many fish.

243
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:35,148
Look.

244
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:37,388
We caught a crab too.

245
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,228
I never thought Zhou Wei
would be so awesome.

246
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:41,107
He caught most of the fish here.

247
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,867
It's a piece of cake.

248
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,388
So easy.

249
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,707
No fish

250
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:49,227
can escape my fork.

251
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:58,908
Let's head back.

252
00:14:59,308 --> 00:14:59,987
If we stay any longer,

253
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,508
they might be looking for us.

254
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,068
Let's go.

255
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:22,827
Here you go.

256
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:24,188
Thank you.

257
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:24,788
You're welcome.

258
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:30,587
It's nice.

259
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:32,987
Wu Yu,

260
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:33,908
have some.

261
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,347
Okay, you guys eat first.

262
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:36,707
Well, of course.

263
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,108
A great idol must have

264
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,827
a broad range of skills.

265
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,707
When I get popular,
I will give you free tickets.

266
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,508
You have my permission to brag to others

267
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:44,867
that you have tried
the fish soup I made.

268
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:45,388
Here you go.

269
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:46,507
Thank you.

270
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:47,147
Oh, please.

271
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:48,308
Look at your face.

272
00:15:48,508 --> 00:15:49,827
You don't have a celebrity look.

273
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:50,308
Zhou Wei,

274
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:51,747
maybe you should consider
a career change.

275
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,308
I think...

276
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:53,908
Why are you still drinking then?

277
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:55,828
When I get popular,

278
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:56,987
no tickets for you.

279
00:15:58,908 --> 00:15:59,547
Here, Tan Jiao.

280
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:00,347
Have another bowl.

281
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:08,867
It's nice.

282
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,420
(Music Bar and Restaurant)

283
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:49,667
Let go of me!

284
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:50,268
Stop running!

285
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:52,547
Let go of me!

286
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:53,788
What are you trying to do?

287
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:55,987
Sorry, we got the wrong guy.

288
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:58,508
Who are you

289
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:00,107
looking for?

290
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:01,508
It's okay.

291
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:03,107
What's better than
a chance meeting?

292
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:04,107
Tonight,

293
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:05,668
our bar is celebrating
its first anniversary.

294
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:06,427
There is going to be a party.

295
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:07,988
If you are interested,
come and have fun.

296
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,827
Could the person we were after

297
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:12,988
be Zhou Wei?

298
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,708
W-what do you want?

299
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:41,587
I have something to tell you.

300
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:43,268
Stay back.

301
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,627
Don't... Don't be reckless.

302
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:47,508
You...

303
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:48,627
Tan Jiao!

304
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:49,388
Listen to me, Tan Jiao!

305
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:49,988
What are you trying to do?

306
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:50,708
Just hear me out first.

307
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:51,307
You...

308
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:52,107
Help!

309
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:53,708
Zhou Wei, let go of me!

310
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,187
Stay back!

311
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,468
Stay back!

312
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,948
Tagore once said that

313
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:04,268
silence is a virtue,

314
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:06,268
but staying silent
in front of the one you love

315
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:08,187
is cowardice.

316
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:10,827
Tagore?

317
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,827
We haven't seen each other in years.

318
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:14,748
I never thought
we'd cross paths again on a cruise.

319
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:16,508
This must be a second chance from God.

320
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:23,308
But you...

321
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:25,347
Say no more.

322
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,228
When I become famous,

323
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:29,668
I will wrap up
all the envious eyes of women

324
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:31,068
in the world and hand it to you.

325
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:32,667
Tan Jiao,

326
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:35,667
I was too sloppy when we met at the bar.

327
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:37,548
This time, I want
to be serious and tell you,

328
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:39,907
you have my permission
to be my girlfriend.

329
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,667
What the heck are you talking about?

330
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,188
I have a boyfriend.

331
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:48,068
I know that.

332
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,867
You've only known each other
for five days,

333
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:51,508
but we've known each other
for over 20 years.

334
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:54,708
It must be hard

335
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:56,268
for you

336
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,387
to accept this dazzling love,

337
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,308
but I will prove to you that

338
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:04,748
I

339
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:08,627
am the one
who is better for you than him.

340
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,028
Lunatic.

341
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:13,988
So...

342
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:17,948
Tan Jiao!

343
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,347
Tan Jiao!

344
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:20,468
Tan Jiao!

345
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:36,187
What's wrong?

346
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:37,948
Nothing.

347
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:40,508
You can tell him.

348
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:42,788
There is no need to cover up

349
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,107
things between us.

350
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,228
What is wrong with you?

351
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:48,187
There is no "things between us."

352
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:50,268
I told you,

353
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,068
I have a boyfriend.

354
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,067
That's why

355
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,667
we should talk about this openly.

356
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:57,387
Wu Yu, right?

357
00:19:58,387 --> 00:19:58,827
I just

358
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,667
confessed to your girlfriend.

359
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,867
She hasn't said yes,

360
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:04,587
but I'm confident

361
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:06,868
that I can beat you with our 20 years

362
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:07,708
of relationship.

363
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:13,107
Don't look at me.

364
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:14,988
I don't know
what he's talking about either.

365
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:15,827
Also,

366
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:17,587
I hope

367
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,587
you keep this battle between us men.

368
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:20,907
Don't take it out on her.

369
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,308
Or

370
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:24,788
I will come after you.

371
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:39,548
What you saw is real.

372
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:42,347
In that case,

373
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,187
Zhou Wei isn't the murderer.

374
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,187
Based on what he just said,

375
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,748
I also think it can't be him.

376
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:53,868
Is it heavy?

377
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:54,627
Want me to help you?

378
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:56,268
It's okay, thank you.

379
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,387
Careful.

380
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:06,907
Careful. Careful.

381
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:15,147
Here, put this on.

382
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:19,788
Thank you.

383
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:26,907
Have I seen you somewhere before?

384
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,028
There were only
that many people on that ship.

385
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:31,427
You probably saw me before.

386
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,187
I'm not talking about the ship.

387
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:34,788
I don't know why,

388
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:36,387
when I saw you,

389
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,427
it just feels familiar.

390
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,427
That's a pretty old flirting move.

391
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:56,427
What is that?

392
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,107
Watch your step.

393
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:10,907
Snake!

394
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:18,427
It's okay.

395
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:24,147
I didn't know

396
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,268
you would be such a compassionate man.

397
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,347
But sometimes, I think

398
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:34,107
animals are more trustworthy than human.

399
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,268
Let's go.

400
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:50,228
I will carry it.

401
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:50,907
Come on.

402
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,028
Easy.

403
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:17,107
What did the flowers do to you?

404
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:21,228
You're still upset

405
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:22,147
because of Tan Jiao and Wu Yu?

406
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,587
I'm not going to upset myself
over that kind of woman.

407
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,347
Mind your manners.

408
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:28,948
There's no other people on this island.

409
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:30,468
What do I need manners for?

410
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,307
I just don't get it.

411
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,347
In terms of looks, personality
and education,

412
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:36,308
that woman is no match for me.

413
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:37,988
Why does Yu

414
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,268
hang around her all the time?

415
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:42,347
Yu isn't the man for you.

416
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,148
Who's the man for me then?

417
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:44,068
Su Wan?

418
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:45,347
Listen, Mom,

419
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:47,147
I won't marry Su Wan.

420
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,347
I get to decide what I want for my life.

421
00:24:52,587 --> 00:24:53,028
Hang on...

422
00:24:58,827 --> 00:24:59,748
Why did you bring me here?

423
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:03,867
What is this?

424
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:05,508
You will find out soon.

425
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:07,107
Sit.

426
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:23,548
Give me your hand.

427
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:24,308
Come on.

428
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,268
This is insect repellent herb.

429
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:31,587
With it,

430
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,347
no insects will come near you.

431
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:45,387
It's really pretty.

432
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,228
Wu Yu.

433
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:53,627
Thank you.

434
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:56,068
I'm glad you're here.

435
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:57,667
Sit.

436
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:07,748
Actually, for a moment just now,
I was thinking,

437
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:10,788
what should we do if we suddenly go back

438
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:13,147
when you are halfway through tying it?

439
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:23,308
Every time I open my eyes
when I go back,

440
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:26,068
I'm scared.

441
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:30,547
I don't know if I can

442
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:32,347
face this unknown world.

443
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,347
But fortunately,

444
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:39,427
no matter in which time and space,

445
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,627
you are always there waiting for me.

446
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:45,508
It feels...

447
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,867
It feels like you're a coordinate.

448
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:51,187
As long as I find you,

449
00:26:52,468 --> 00:26:54,107
I find my way home.

450
00:27:01,268 --> 00:27:02,068
Because you are

451
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:04,107
my coordinate too.

452
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,907
Do you find me very childish?

453
00:27:58,268 --> 00:27:59,028
No.

454
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,387
Do you know why I like you so much?

455
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:02,827
No, I don't.

456
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:04,627
Why?

457
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:05,867
I have

458
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,107
always labeled myself as a rocker,

459
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,907
and I always say I want to be myself,

460
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,068
but the truth is I care a lot
about what others think about me.

461
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:16,667
Actually,

462
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:20,028
everyone cares about
what others think about them.

463
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:22,068
Like me,

464
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:24,308
when I first started
writing online articles,

465
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,827
I would read every reader's comments.

466
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:31,067
It would even upset me
for a couple of days

467
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:32,427
when I saw comments that criticized me.

468
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:35,107
But then I realized that

469
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,547
no matter how well or how hard you work,

470
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:38,748
there are still people
who would criticize you.

471
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:40,907
It was then that I decided that

472
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:43,508
I would just focus on what I like to do.

473
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,147
This is what I like about you.

474
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:50,427
I've always felt like

475
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:51,827
I was living in a shell.

476
00:28:57,748 --> 00:28:59,347
Actually, I don't like
wearing necklaces.

477
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:00,867
I'm only wearing these things

478
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:03,308
to make myself look more like a rocker.

479
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:07,907
I want to be like you,

480
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:09,708
and live a free life.

481
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,748
From now on, I will start over.

482
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:34,548
So,

483
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,107
will you still be my friend?

484
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:46,427
Why not?

485
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:51,508
Actually, I can see that

486
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,548
you two are perfect for each other.

487
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:57,427
We will be buddies from now on.

488
00:29:58,508 --> 00:29:59,427
If your girlfriend...

489
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:02,988
If Wu Yu let you down,

490
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:05,228
just tell me, I will help you.

491
00:30:06,228 --> 00:30:07,228
Don't worry.

492
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:09,347
He won't let me down.

493
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:10,427
But...

494
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,907
But, thank you anyway.

495
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:15,427
Come on.

496
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,708
Buddy.

497
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:20,107
Mrs. Chen, don't panic.

498
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:21,547
She probably just went to take a walk.

499
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:23,028
Maybe she will come back soon.

500
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:24,188
Where do you think she is?

501
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:25,387
It's been half a day.

502
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:26,587
It's a small island.

503
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:28,508
Don't panic.

504
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:29,708
Tan Jiao.

505
00:30:30,268 --> 00:30:30,988
Tan Jiao,

506
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,708
did you see Ying?

507
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:34,068
No.

508
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:36,268
What should I do?

509
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:37,867
What's going on?

510
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:39,428
Ying threw a fit

511
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:40,388
and ran out on her own.

512
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:41,827
She hasn't come back yet.

513
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,468
She's just sulking.

514
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:44,627
She will probably be back later.

515
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,187
But the island isn't that big.

516
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,787
She's been out there for a long time.

517
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:48,948
Where could she go?

518
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:49,907
We got a trouble!

519
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:51,068
Something happened.

520
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:52,627
It's Zhu Jirui.

521
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:54,468
Zhu Jirui is gone.

522
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,468
Slow down and tell us what happened.

523
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,068
We went to get some water.

524
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:00,627
On our way back, I was walking

525
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:01,107
in front of her.

526
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:02,147
We were chatting.

527
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:03,827
I looked back when she wasn't replying.

528
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:05,427
And she... She was just gone.

529
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:06,907
To be precise,

530
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:08,948
she vanished.

531
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:10,468
Vanished?

532
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,907
Could she have had
some kind of accident?

533
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,147
Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,147
Yu,

535
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,347
could Ying have had an accident too?

536
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:23,867
I don't think this is an accident.

537
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:26,468
Look at this.

538
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,468
I found this in the woods.

539
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:31,308
What about it?

540
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:33,427
Isn't it just a wrapper?

541
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:34,988
I checked our supply box.

542
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:36,468
There was no such food in it.

543
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:40,708
Are you saying that...

544
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,028
I suspect that other than us,

545
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:44,427
there are other people on this island.

546
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:46,147
Yu,

547
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:47,427
don't scare me.

548
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:51,028
What am I going to do

549
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,627
if something really
had happened to Ying?

550
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,468
What should we do now?

551
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:57,988
Let's stay calm first.

552
00:31:58,147 --> 00:31:59,468
Let's stay together, don't split up.

553
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:01,347
Let's check the island more carefully.

554
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:03,147
See if we can find Ying and Zhu Jirui.

555
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:12,228
How did it go?

556
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:16,428
We've gone around the island.

557
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:17,548
We found nothing.

558
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:22,228
Will that mysterious guy

559
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:23,988
take us all away?

560
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:25,907
Let him come then.

561
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,347
There are so many of us.

562
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,068
One mysterious guy can't scare us.

563
00:32:32,107 --> 00:32:32,788
But

564
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:35,988
why hasn't the rescue team come yet?

565
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:52,667
What's wrong?

566
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:54,387
Nothing.

567
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,507
Zhu is right.

568
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:57,068
We will be fine
as long as we stay together.

569
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:58,788
Let's search the woods in front.

570
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,268
Okay, come on.

571
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:03,028
Watch your step.

572
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:05,068
Careful.

573
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:06,548
Careful.

574
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:08,028
This way.

575
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,627
What did you see?

576
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,267
The fog cleared,

577
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:14,708
but I couldn't find the island before.

578
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:18,668
But this island is
only a few dozen kilometers

579
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,107
from the previous one, isn't it?

580
00:33:22,187 --> 00:33:23,028
It disappeared.

581
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:26,908
We're not really

582
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:28,548
stuck on this island, are we?

583
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:30,587
No.

584
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:31,748
Don't forget that

585
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:32,307
a year later,

586
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,748
we will meet each other in Dali.

587
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:36,107
Ying!

588
00:33:38,468 --> 00:33:39,347
Rui!

589
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:40,747
- Ying!
- Chen Ruying!

590
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:41,868
Rui!

591
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:43,028
Ying!

592
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:45,788
Rui!

593
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,228
Ying!

594
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,827
Zhu Jirui!

595
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,788
Ying!

596
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:53,548
Rui!

597
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,387
Ying!

598
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:57,867
Rui!

599
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:03,948
We just checked the beach.

600
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,468
There is no way anyone can hide there.

601
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:06,988
I'm sure they are in the woods.

602
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,267
Let's look again.

603
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:09,667
Come on.

604
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:10,508
Let's keep looking.

605
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:13,707
Rui!

606
00:34:14,227 --> 00:34:14,908
Ying!

607
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:15,587
Careful.

608
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:19,028
- Ying!
- Rui!

609
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:20,908
Zhu Jirui!

610
00:34:21,348 --> 00:34:22,707
Zhu Jirui!

611
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:23,868
Ying!

612
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:27,948
- Zhu Jirui!
- Ying!

613
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:30,988
Rui!

614
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:32,787
Ying!

615
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,147
- Ying!
- Ying!

616
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:41,147
Zhu Jirui!

617
00:34:42,828 --> 00:34:43,747
Chen Ruying!

618
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:47,828
Chen Ruying!

619
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,107
Ying!

620
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,307
Zhu Jirui!

621
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:52,028
Miss Zhu!

622
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,348
- Ying!
- Ying!

623
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:02,468
- Zhu?
- Zhu?

624
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:03,468
Zhu?

625
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:04,227
Zhu?

626
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:05,307
Wu Yu,

627
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:07,028
you saw that too, right?

628
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:09,348
How did he disappear in a flash?

629
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:10,667
He was just right here.

630
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:12,388
What's happening?

631
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:13,667
It's okay, I'm here.

632
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:14,468
Zhu!

633
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:16,788
Zhu!

634
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:17,747
Let's keep moving.

635
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:28,587
Wu Yu?

636
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:32,548
Wu Yu!

637
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:34,147
Wu Yu!

638
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:36,908
Wu Yu!

639
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:39,988
Wu Yu!

640
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:41,948
Wu Yu!

641
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:44,707
Wu Yu!

642
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:46,548
Wu Yu!

643
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:49,587
