I have a few questions for you.

23
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,290
The details
of the Jinghai Serial Murder case

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,371
have not been made public yet.

25
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,371
How did you know?

26
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:08,850
My sister is one of the victims.

27
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,211
Her whereabouts are still unknown.

28
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,170
I'm sorry to hear that.

29
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:15,730
But even if you're the victim's family,

30
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,850
we didn't disclose it to anyone either.

31
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,491
Also,

32
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:20,010
is the transfer order the only reason

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,410
you're suspecting Su Wan?

34
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,570
Officer Shen,

35
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,730
I know you'll doubt what I say.

36
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,730
But there's enough cyanide found

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,491
in Su Wan's home to commit the crime.

38
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,290
That's the cause of death
in the Jinghai Serial Murder case.

39
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:35,890
More importantly,

40
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,570
Su Wan also disappeared

41
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,051
after Tan Jiao went missing.

42
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,251
I know I can't explain

43
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,690
what I just said.

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,570
But this concerns my family's life.

45
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,850
Please believe me.

46
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,010
Perhaps,

47
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,651
trust your instinct.

48
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,890
I rarely trust instinct.

49
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:00,931
Yes.

50
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,290
That's how you've always been.

51
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,931
Because only evidence doesn't lie.

52
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,010
But I'll look into Su Wan.

53
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,371
But you must tell me everything
after this.

54
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:12,890
You can go now.

55
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:20,811
Wu Yu, what's this?

56
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:21,610
Where's Tan Jiao?

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,290
Wu Yu, what's your problem?

58
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:22,811
What are you doing?

59
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,450
Where's Tan Jiao?

60
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,531
How would I know? Let me go!

61
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:25,610
Wu Yu, calm down.

62
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,660
(Potassium Cyanide Transfer Order)

63
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,091
Our factory

64
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,450
is running out of potassium cyanide.

65
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,610
So we borrowed from other factories.

66
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,850
It was done with a strict procedure.

67
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:35,811
And Ms. Feng

68
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,531
is aware of this matter.

69
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,771
I told him to make this arrangement.

70
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,771
Captain Shen.

71
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,450
Tell me!

72
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,251
Where's Tan Jiao?

73
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,651
She must have seen through your plan.

74
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,011
That's why you kidnapped her, right?

75
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,891
I did not!

76
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,771
Why did you come
to Chen's residence late at night?

77
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,011
I did come that night.

78
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,810
But I just want to meet Tan Jiao

79
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,091
and ask her why she wants
to ruin the wedding.

80
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,050
That was all.

81
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,571
Why must you meet her at night?

82
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,930
You were obviously hiding something.

83
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,331
Can you be more rational?

84
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:38,370
It's not something we can talk about
during the day.

85
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,771
That's why I came to see her at night.

86
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,651
Besides, I left soon after that.

87
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,810
All these years,

88
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,891
I treated Ms. Feng's family

89
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:49,971
like my family.

90
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:51,571
I would never do

91
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:52,730
such a thing to Ying.

92
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,651
Okay, tell me.

93
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,011
You have a car.

94
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:57,290
But why did you walk here?

95
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,410
I don't even know how to drive.

96
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,250
(Watch out!)

97
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,050
We found the car

98
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,131
that almost hit you.

99
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,691
But it was an abandoned vehicle.

100
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,170
I think you can investigate the evidence

101
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,691
from the Jinghai Cyanide Serial Killing.

102
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,810
Yes,

103
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,050
we were thinking of the same thing.

104
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,091
So we compared the footage
at the time of the crime.

105
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,211
We found out this car

106
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,211
had appeared at the scene
where the two female victims' bodies

107
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,131
were dumped.

108
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,211
My left thumb was injured.

109
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,211
I can't hold the steering wheel firmly.

110
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,131
He's right.

111
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,651
All these years, he either hails a taxi

112
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,011
or lets the driver drive him.

113
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,410
If he doesn't know how to drive,

114
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,011
he's not the killer

115
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,410
of the Jinghai Serial Murder case, then.

116
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,610
Or

117
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:50,410
he can't commit the crime alone.

118
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:57,771
Oh, don't stop there.

119
00:05:58,331 --> 00:05:59,211
Are you going to give up that easily?

120
00:05:59,211 --> 00:05:59,691
Here.

121
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,170
You're welcome to look into my phone.

122
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,531
You're not going to look at it?

123
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,331
I'll give you a clue, then.

124
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,971
You can investigate Wu Yu.

125
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,451
He's the most suspicious one.

126
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,531
The footage is pointing out the obvious.

127
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,571
They're probably in this together.

128
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,050
After we pay the ransom,

129
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,891
he'll ask his girlfriend
to release Ying.

130
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,331
Am I right?

131
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,771
What do you mean by that?

132
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,410
Do I have to make it clear?

133
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,771
You stalked me all day.

134
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:26,771
Did you find out anything?

135
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:27,971
Mr. Su,

136
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,971
please calm down.

137
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,531
Who are you to tell me to calm down?

138
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,211
You wronged me for nothing

139
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,410
and treated me as a suspect.

140
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,410
Who's going to compensate
for ruining my reputation?

141
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,850
Listen.

142
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,651
If you don't give me an explanation,

143
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:41,131
I'm going to pursue this to the end.

00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:00,490
What do you...

172
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,490
Record the footage

173
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,810
and read what's written here.

174
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,827
(Prepare one million yuan in cash
within three days.)

175
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:13,300
(I'll tell you the drop-off location,
remember don't play any tricks.)

176
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,651
If you play any tricks...

177
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,451
I'll read it.

178
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,691
But if you do anything

179
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:39,571
to hurt us,

180
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,770
I promise that you won't get anything.

181
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,811
You're not in a position
to negotiate with me.

182
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,730
Don't worry.

183
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,370
We've already reported it to the police.

184
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,730
We'll definitely find Ying.

185
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,091
All right, guys.

186
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,650
The special task force
has now launched its investigation.

187
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,250
At present, we've put the surrounding

188
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:27,971
of the house under tight surveillance

189
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,610
and also installed tapping devices

190
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,010
on your communication devices.

191
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,130
I hope everyone can remain calm

192
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,411
and work with the police force

193
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,530
from now on.

194
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,171
Zhu,

195
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,331
please be okay.

196
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,130
Please be safe.

197
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,010
Captain Shen,

198
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,971
I'll head back first.

199
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,250
Don't worry.

200
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,931
Everything will be fine with us around.

201
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,331
Let me send you home.

202
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,571
Thanks.

203
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:46,971
Thank you.

204
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,490
Actually,

205
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,850
everyone should be thanking you.

206
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,010
Me?

207
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:55,171
If you didn't contact me first,

208
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:55,850
the Chen Family

209
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,730
would be even more out of control now.

210
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:00,490
Then Tan Jiao and Chen Ruying
would be in more danger.

211
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,691
What should we do now?

212
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,250
Staid Shen,

213
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,850
Zhu will be safe, right?

214
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:18,291
The situation is complicated.

215
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,250
The footage clearly said
not to report to the police.

216
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,091
We need to pretend

217
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,610
that the police are not involved.

218
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,850
Zhou Xiaoyu,

219
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,730
I need you to work with us.

220
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:29,730
Leave Chen's residence for now

221
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,451
and pretend you don't know anything.

222
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,850
We must work together for Tan Jiao.

223
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:34,850
Trust me.

224
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,730
I'll bring Tan Jiao back.

225
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,931
We'll do this together.

226
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,691
After writing so many suspense novels,

227
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,091
is this your first time

228
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,370
being in such a situation?

229
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:18,850
How did you undo it?

230
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,091
You can find the way in my novel.

231
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:26,451
Untie my feet.

232
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,370
Hurry and be quick.

233
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,530
Here, here.

234
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,530
You can remove it altogether.

235
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,291
There you go.

236
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,010
Let's get out of here.

237
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,211
Come on.

238
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,370
Hurry up.

239
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,610
Quiet.

240
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,931
Let's go and don't make any sound.

241
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,130
Someone is trying to escape!

242
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,250
You're in this together?

243
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,331
Do you think you can escape?

244
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,171
Are you okay?

245
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,451
It's you?

246
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,610
I didn't expect you're full of tricks.

247
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,411
Can't you be more careful?

248
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:39,931
She could still escape
after being tied up.

249
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,130
I...

250
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,571
I'll pay more attention next time.

251
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:47,931
So...

252
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:51,370
So you're all behind all these?

253
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,530
But why are you doing this?

254
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:58,291
Yes, I did it.

255
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,010
Are you surprised?

256
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,971
I want to get back at you,

257
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,530
my mom,

258
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,770
and everyone.

259
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,370
All of you lied to me.

260
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,571
You guys owe me!

261
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,411
What about Wu Miao?

262
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,411
Did you kidnap Wu Miao too?

263
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,411
Let her go and behave yourself.

264
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:14,411
Let me go!

265
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,730
Xu,

266
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,370
it looks like

267
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,331
we need to speed things up.

268

This is good.

273
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:57,530
Your acting is pretty good.

274
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,370
It looks pretty real.

275
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,890
She's just an empty suit.

276
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,490
She'll behave after a slap.

277
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,770
She pretended to be brave
and intelligent before.

278
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,571
In the end, she fell into my tricks.

279
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:09,610
But

280
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,730
I've worked for your family
for ten years.

281
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,411
Based on what I know about Ms. Feng,

282
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,890
she prefers to take the lead.

283
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,530
Would she...

284
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,091
There's nothing to be scared of.

285
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,490
I had it all planned out
before coming here.

286
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:24,770
Everyone has a weakness.

287
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,571
My mom's weakness

288
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:28,850
is me.

289
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,650
Once you have control over her weakness,

290
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,850
she'll do whatever you say.

291
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,091
Am I right?

292
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:35,850
Yes, you're right.

293
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,250
You're absolutely right.

294
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,530
You're Ms. Feng's only daughter.

295
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:42,571
She'll definitely comply with you.

296
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:43,411
We'll just wait and see.

297
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,530
My mom will definitely pay
the ransom to save me.

We've prepared the money.

321

The kidnapper just sent out the footage.

322
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,411
The drop-off location

323

is the underground parking lot
at Jinghai Road.

324

We'll set out right away.

325

I've informed the police unit
to keep the place under surveillance.

From the footage,

(But they won't come
into contact with you.)

(Only Huang will be trailing you.)

(You can talk to us
through the earpiece anytime.)

00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:58,891
(If anything happens,)

343

(you must listen to our command.)

344
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,340
(Unknown Number)

345
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,651
They've changed the drop-off location

346
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,290
to the men's toilet on the west side
of the 5th floor in Jinghai Building.

347
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:25,371
Shen Shiyan, follow him.

348
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,611
Hello?

349
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,770
Within two hours,

350
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,530
put the money in the trash can

351
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,651
at the north gate
of the suburban forest park.

352
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:25,851
It'll take at least a two-hour drive

353
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,971
to the suburban forest park.

354
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:28,770
The traffic will be heavy
because it's rush hour.

355
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,290
Just head to the location.

356
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:31,530
Captain Ding will be ahead of us

357
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,691
and deploy the officers there
in advance.

358
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:49,891
What are you doing?

359
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:50,371
Don't move!

360
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:51,171
What are you doing?

361
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,250
I'm just picking garbage!

362
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,171
Behave!

363
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,570
Let me go!

364
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,211
Let me go.

365
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:57,891
What's going on here?

366
00:22:58,131 --> 00:22:59,050
Someone switch the money.

367
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,691
What money?

368
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:03,770
What are you guys doing?

369
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:07,290
I switched it.

370
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,010
Hello?

371
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:14,490
Within two hours,

372
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:16,171
put the money in the trash can

373
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:17,211
at the north gate
of the suburban forest park.

374
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,971
(Unknown Number)
(When I reached the men's toilet,)

375
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,250
(I received a text message.)

376
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,211
(They asked me to switch the money)

377
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,211
(with the garbage from the toilet.)

378
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,770
(They told me not to inform the police,)

379
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,211
(or they'll harm the hostages.)

380
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,010
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

381
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,851
Are you messing with me?

382
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:37,490
Huang.

383
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:39,530
Didn't you notice

384
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,971
that Shen Shiyan wasn't here all along?

385
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,131
Let's carry out the second plan now.

386
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,010
(I know the police are involved.)

387
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:57,290
(If you want Tan Jiao
and Chen Ruying to live,)

388
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:58,611
(you must do what I say.)

389
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,730
What's wrong?

390
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,411
Nothing.

391
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:07,971
I was just thinking
about Tan Jiao's safety.

392
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:16,411
Wait.

393
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:30,730
He's still threatening you?

394
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:35,931
I wonder

395
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:38,010
if we should pretend to feel threatened

396
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:39,090
and lure him out.

397
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,570
It's a good idea.

398
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,730
The kidnapper wanted you to drop
the money at the underground parking lot

399
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,891
and he also knew
the police are involved.

400
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:48,530
Then he probably won't appear

401
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,651
at the park.

402
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,411
He would inform

403
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:53,371
and change the location
at the last minute.

404
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,171
It doesn't matter how many times
he changed the location.

405
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:56,131
His goal

406
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:58,171
is to inform you in different ways

407
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,730
to either lose the police

408
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,851
or switch the money bag.

409
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:03,611
So I need to keep you guys informed.

410
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,290
But we mustn't alert them.

411
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:09,570
Wu Yu,

412
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,891
we've prepared a watch for you.

413
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,211
It's installed with a tapping device

414
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,211
and a camera.

415
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:17,010
This way,

416
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,290
we'll know every piece of information

417
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,570
you'll receive in real-time.

418
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,171
If the kidnapper decides
to switch the content,

419
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,530
you must pretend to cooperate with him.

420
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:25,451
We can take action

421
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,330
according to the message received.

422
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:27,770
Okay.

423
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:31,651
Stop pacing about.

424
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,171
You're giving me a headache.

425
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,611
Wu Yu.

426
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:50,290
Where's she?

427
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,691
You promised

428
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,651
that you'd bring Ying home.

429
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,570
Madam,

430
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,451
we set up a trap.

431
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,330
But the kidnapper didn't fall for it.

432
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:07,611
I'm sorry.

433
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:11,570
I told you not to call the police.

434
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:12,451
See what happened?

435
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,570
I only want to know

436
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,290
when you're going

437
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,810
to bring Ying home.

438
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,971
We'll rescue the hostage
as soon as possible.

439
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,651
As soon as possible?

440
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:35,131
Officer Shen,

441
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,050
what happened?

442
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:40,010
Our plans were meticulous.

443
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:41,530
No one went to the toilet

444
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,050
until the office building was closed.

445
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,330
How did the kidnapper find out?

446
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:51,050
(Are you asking me?)

447
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:52,411
(Who are you asking?)

448
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:53,570
(Let me go!)

449
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,330
(Madam Feng, calm down.)

450
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,171
(What are you doing?)

451
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:57,851
Are they calling this investigating
a case?

452
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,171
They would never imagine

453
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,730
that the spy wasn't a person

454
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,050
but spy cameras.

455
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,290
Are you still blaming yourself?

456
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,211
It's all my fault.

457
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:36,330
I was too focused on Su Wan
in the beginning

458
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:38,931
and led everyone in the wrong direction.

459
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:40,570
Do you still remember

460
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,050
what Zhou Xiaoyu told us?

461
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:44,411
She said Tan Jiao
is an intelligent person

462
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:46,090
and someone with a strong will
to survive.

463
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,010
Someone like her

464
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,931
will definitely leave
a lot of clues for us.

465
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:51,490
So

466
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,371
with your understanding of Tan Jiao

467
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,611
and your tacit understanding,

468
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:56,250
I believe we'll find

469
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,691
a new clue.

470
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,851
Maybe you don't trust yourself.

471
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:04,290
But you can trust Tan Jiao

472
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,250
and Zhou Xiaoyu.

473
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:06,851
Of course,

474
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,851
there's me too.

475
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:23,730
Brat,

476
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,131
it's time to record a video.

477
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,411
Ying,

478
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,691
take this.

479
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,691
What's this?

480
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:42,611
It's gross.

481
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:43,971
It's fake.

482
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,851
Fake blood.

483
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:46,851
I mix red coloring with honey.

484
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:47,971
Didn't you tell me

485
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:49,611
to make things more realistic?

486
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:52,451
Chen Ruying,

487
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,371
have you ever thought

488
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,611
about how to clean this mess?

489
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,451
I couldn't care less about the rest.

490
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,171
I'll only be happy

491
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:03,131
when I see you suffer.

492
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,770
Stop talking too much.

493
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,971
I'll use your blood if you keep talking.

494
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,651
Enough, stop messing around.

495
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:12,171
It's showtime.

496
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:14,611
Don't scare our "kidnapper."

497
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:43,171
What...

498
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:44,290
Ying's face is covered in blood.

499
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,530
(I told you not to play any tricks.)

500
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,211
(Wu Yu,)

501
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:52,891
(you still call the police.)

502
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,611
(You're such a disappointment.)

503

(You're such a disappointment!)

504

Ying!

505

506
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,330

507

508
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:16,050

509
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,651

510

511

512
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,611
(won't be this knife anymore.)

513
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:33,451
I'm sure the kidnapper abused Ying.

514
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:35,050
What should we do?

515
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:36,730
What should we do now?

516
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,611
Officer Shen,

517
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:39,570
- I...
- He'll empty the stadium.

518
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,290
Since they've made such a request,

519
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:42,371
we'll just do what they say.

520
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,611
See if you can empty the stadium.

521
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:45,290
I need

522
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,570
to talk to my superior about this.

523
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,570
There's no time to lose.

524
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,171
Come on.

525
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:02,931
Wu Yu,

526
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:05,530
what are you planning?

527
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:12,290
How did the kidnapper find out

528
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,530
about our plans?

529
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,851
Think about it carefully.

530
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,171
Could there be something hidden at home?

531
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,131
Let's go.

532
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:23,411
I'll take you
to the technical department.

533
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,371
What... What are they doing?

534
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:37,371
Officers, what are you doing?

535
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:40,770
Wait, what are they doing?

536
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:47,010
No.

537
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:48,570
No, don't.

538
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,770
Impossible.

539
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,411
My cameras were well-hidden.

540
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,570
They wouldn't have noticed them.

541
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,131
What's going on here?

542
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,411
Did you do it?

543
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:08,411
Tell me!

544
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:10,971
I...

545
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,371
How could it be me?

546
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,211
You have me all tied up.

547
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:17,851
What can I even do?

548
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:19,851
How did they find out?

549
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,250
This is how the kidnapper finds out

550
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,651
about all our plans.

551
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,451
If Wu Yu didn't notice it,

552
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,171
we'll still be kept in the dark.

553
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:31,651
Who installed all these?

554
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:33,770
We're still looking into

555
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,691
those who have access to this house.

556
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,171
Wu Yu,

557
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:40,691
how did you find out?

558
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,891
(You're such a disappointment.)

559
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:46,090
(You're such a disappointment!)

560
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:49,490
Did you notice

561
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,810
the bloodstain on Tan Jiao?

562
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:55,891
Some alphabets

563
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,651
on the logo of her shirt
were covered in blood

564
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,090
and spelled out as "CAM."

565
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,490
Are you saying Miss Tan

566
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,570
is using this method

567
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,931
to give us clues?

568
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,211
Besides that,

569
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,050
based on his conduct,

570
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:07,770
he's used

571
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,530
to making his move
after knowing our plans.

572
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,211
Now that he lost his cameras,

573
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:13,411
he's likely to show up.

574
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,330
Chen Ruying,

575
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,931
the police have found

576
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,010
important clues now.

577
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:23,570
Are you still going to do this?

578
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:26,371
Did they really find out?

579
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,211
We're not really kidnapping anyway.

580
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,490
We only joined hands

581
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,050
to prank you, that's all.

582
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,651
Are you calling this a prank?

583
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,691
Of course.

584
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,770
I did it

585
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,451
because everyone

586
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,971
was against me marrying Wu Yu.

587
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,851
That's why I got upset
and pulled this prank on you guys.

588
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:47,570
But since it has come to this,

589
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:49,090
I don't plan to continue anymore.

590
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,090
Why don't we just end it here?

591
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,290
Xu, say something.

592
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,171
Did you hear me
when I said to end all of this?

593
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,050
Miss Chen,

594
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,371
do you think you're at home now?

595
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:07,651
Do you think you can decide

596
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:09,050
when to end all this?

597
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,170
You...

598
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,570
You...

599
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,331
What are you doing?

600
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:20,210
Money.

601
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,251
I want money.

602
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,891
So you had it all planned out.

603
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:28,010
You liar!

604
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:33,610
Ying,

605
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:37,090
I've been telling the truth.

606
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,971
Ying,

607
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:40,530
it's you.

608
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,490
You're so full of yourself.

609
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:46,490
You thought I was joking around
with you.

610
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:46,931
Let me go.

611
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,411
Do you think I'm joking around with you?

612
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,050
Do I look like I'm joking around?

613
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,771
Let go.

614
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,251
Let me go.

615
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:54,210
Help! Is there anyone out there?

616
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,411
- Help!
- Shut up!

617
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,331
If you shout,

618
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,570
I'll kill both of you!

619
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:05,130
Let me go.

620
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,891
Xu, you're despicable!

621
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,490
I don't care

622
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,490
what you call me.

623
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:12,851
What matters

624
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,851
is for you two

625
