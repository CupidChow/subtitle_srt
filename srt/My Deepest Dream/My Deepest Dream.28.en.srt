00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,156
This is a kind of rare earth magnet

13
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:55,996
which is called NdFeB magnet.

14
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:57,316
It possesses strong permanent magnetism.

15
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,075
Its magnetism is able
to break the rotation

16

of the electric motor's
electromagnetic coil.

Your hand, Wu Yu.

Wu Yu!

Duan Yunying,

00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,316
we've investigated your identity.

You can't get away with it.

32
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:54,716
Your plan failed.

33
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:56,955
Come on out!

34
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,235
You still have the chance
to make up for it.

35
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,996
Duan Yunying has already died.

36
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,515
On the day Ren Jie died,

37
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,276
he was buried together with her.

38
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,036
Who are you now?

39
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,756
Are you on the island as well?

40
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:17,676
I lost this time.

00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,996
I'll send you to hell next time.

42

Like you said,

43
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,035
Tan Jiao and I still have a chance.

44
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,676
As long as we know your true identity,

45
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:27,756
no matter which universe we're in,

46
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:28,955

Wu Yu.

50
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:16,556
Why am I here?

51
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:17,996
You fainted in the cave.

52
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:20,116
Everyone helped to get you back here.

53
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:21,556
Cave?

54
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:25,476
Where is Chen Xingjian?

55
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:26,116
Tan Jiao.

56
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:27,676
- Where is Chen Xingjian?
- Tan Jiao.

57
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:32,556
When we found him,

58
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:35,035
he had stopped breathing.

59
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:45,316
I should be the one

60
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,715
who walked in front

61
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:48,796
when we were in the cave.

62
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,595
I always misunderstood him back then.

63
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,796
But on this island,

64
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,316
he's rescued me for several times.

65
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:02,316
Miss Tan,

66
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:05,035
I know you're upset,

67
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,236
but our top priority now

68
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:09,476
is to catch the culprit.

69
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:12,595
The culprit?

70
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:13,515
Yes.

71
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,436
If not, how could there be

72
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:16,556
traps on this desert island?

73
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,436
Besides, if he accidentally

74
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:20,676
walked ahead of you,

75
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,236
it meant the target

76
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:23,796
of the culprit was either you
or Wu Yu.

77
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,756
In fact, the culprit is evident now.

78
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,676
Look who's not around now.

79
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:38,796
Zhou Wei.

80
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:41,316
Zhou Wei is not here.

81
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,996
When things happened,

82
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:44,155
we were all together.

83
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,155
Except Zhou Wei.

84
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:46,876
Where's he now?

85
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:48,476
He's gone.

86
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:51,955
He must've felt guilty.

87
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,996
Doesn't it prove that he's the culprit?

88
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:55,556
I didn't expect it to be him.

89
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:57,835
This singer

90
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,236
looked innocent.

91
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,356
I never thought he'd be so cruel.

92
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,316
- Actually, Zhou...
- It turned out to be him.

93
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,356
Our top priority now is to find him.

94
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,876
We can't keep a culprit by our sides.

95
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,316
Zhou Wei is not the culprit.

96
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:23,395
I know.

97
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:25,955
And I think the real culprit is

98
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,155
hiding in this island.

99
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,876
Yan Yuan and Chen Ruying were
abroad back then.

100
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:31,715
They couldn't commit it.

101
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:33,756
Could it be...

102
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,236
Could it be Zhu Yutong?

103
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,876
He faked his own death,
and then he hid himself.

104
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,676
In Yan Yuan case
and at the Chen Residence,

105
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:41,835
someone suddenly attacked us.

106
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,236
But I saw Zhu being cremated.

107
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:45,556
It's impossible for him
to fake his own death.

108
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,395
Then, could it be Zhu Jirui

109
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,955
or Feng Yan?

110
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:55,595
I couldn't see his face clearly,

111
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:56,796
but I'm sure he's a man.

112
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:03,835
Do you think

113
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,796
it's possible that the real Duan Yunying

114
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,155
is not among them,

115
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:11,195
but hiding in the island?

116
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,876
Just like Chen Xingjian.

117
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:14,395
It's hard to say.

118
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,195
Let's look for Zhou Wei first.

119
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,756
We'll figure it out
after finding him.

120
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:21,236
Okay.

121
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:35,956
We've searched everywhere on the island.

122
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,635
There's not a soul in sight.

123
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,035
What about you guys?

124
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,275
What's wrong, Ying?

125
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:45,395
It's Zhou Wei.

126
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:48,476
I was exhausted so I returned
to the tent to get some rest.

127
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,675
I just took a sip of water.

128
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:51,756
Then, he...

129
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:56,476
What are you doing, Zhou Wei?

130
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,275
Our food was all ruined.

131
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:10,956
This scoundrel.

132
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:13,876
He just won't give us a way out.

133
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:15,356
Chen Ruying,

134
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,076
did you see where he went?

135
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,196
I don't know.

136
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:22,915
I suppose he's in the cave.

137
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:24,596
The cave is the only place
we haven't searched.

138
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:28,035
It's useless to hide himself.

139
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,476
Let's go find him now.

140
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,476
Come, here.

141
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:32,596
Wu Yu.

142
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:39,076
Let's go.

143
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,635
Will it be too risky?

144
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,675
Why don't we wait for a little longer?

145
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:00,675
There are many of us,
there's no need to be afraid.

146
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,155
He's in the dark now.

147
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:03,956
If we don't catch him now,

148
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:05,236
he'll sneak up on us one by one.

149
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,076
All of us will die in the end.

150
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,356
But... but...

151
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:10,315
We've walked for so long.

152
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,155
Why is there nothing to be found?

153
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:13,956
It's such a long cave.

154
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:15,476
We don't know where Zhou Wei is hiding.

155
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:18,395
Where is Zhu Yutong?

156
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,035
Zhu Yutong.

157
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,196
Zhu Yutong.

158
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:21,675
Zhu Yutong.

159
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,315
Is...

160
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,435
Is this a trap that Zhou Wei sets?

161
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,956
Don't panic.

162
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:28,876
This is neither a trap nor a gimmick.

163
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,236
It's a fluctuation of the universe
on this island.

164
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,596
What do you mean?

165
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:34,476
The time and space on this island

166
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:35,555
are very unstable.

167
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:36,996
That causes the emergence
of the folding phenomenon.

168
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,996
It'll teleport us to a random place.

169
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,155
But this kind of teleportation

170
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,515
won't affect our bodies.

171
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,635
Just like that day when Zhou Wei and I

172
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:44,716
were teleported.

173
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,795
What if we're teleported
to a place near Zhou Wei?

174
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:52,876
Well...

175
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,076
What should we do?

176
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,756
If Zhou Wei found that we're alone,

177
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:59,315
he'll lay a hand on us for sure.

178
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,236
Why don't we go back now?

179
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:07,116
Wu Yu.

180
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,435
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

181
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,275
Chen Ruying was right.

182
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,315
If the culprit found out
that we're alone,

183
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:14,675
he'll surely make a move.

184
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,315
We have to get them back
as soon as possible.

185
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,675
Just hold my hand tight.

186
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,555
Don't let go.

187
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:20,076
In this way,
if space-time folding occurs,

188
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:21,155
we'll also be teleported together.

189
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:27,915
It's Zhou Wei.

190
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:28,435
Let's go after him.

191
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:35,515
Stop there, Zhou Wei.

192
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:37,395
Be careful.

193
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:52,675
Stop there!

194
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,076
Stop there!

195
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:58,515
This way!

196
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:12,596
Zhou Wei.

197
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:14,635
Zhou Wei, stop running!

198
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:16,476
We're here to help you.

199
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,236
I know you're not the culprit.

200
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:22,155
That you're being framed.

201
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:24,116
You're just being controlled.

202
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:37,356
I'm dangerous.

203
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:38,915
Leave!

204
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:40,236
Just go.

205
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:02,515
Wu Yu.

206
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:22,395
Mom.

207
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,996
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

208
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,275
Is anyone there?

209
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,876
Wu Yu!

210
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:28,876
Hello?

211
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:30,836
Be careful!

212
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:31,635
Look out!

213
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:32,756
You too, Mom.

214
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,716
Wu Yu!

215
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:36,716
Yu!

216
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:38,596
- Yu!
- Wu Yu!

217
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:40,515
Ying, Madam Feng.

218
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,196
Mom and I have been looking for you.

219
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,596
We were freaked out just now.

220
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,956
I found Zhou Wei.

221
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,315
Tan Jiao might be in danger.

222
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,035
Follow me.

223
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:47,956
Okay.

224
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:49,035
Be careful.

225
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:49,435
Okay.

226
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:50,395
Be careful.

227
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:53,956
Zhou Wei.

228
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,236
Wake up.

229
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,275
Don't let him control you.

230
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,596
Didn't you say you wanted
to be yourself?

231
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:15,315
Tan Jiao.

232
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:19,155
Zhou Wei.

233
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:20,876
You're awake.

234
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:22,915
I... I didn't mean it,

235
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:23,476
Tan Jiao.

236
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:24,756
I know.

237
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:26,155
You were being controlled.

238
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:27,555
Tell me.

239
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,356
Who's that person?

240
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,836
I don't know.

241
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:32,196
Who is it?

242
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:33,915
I don't know.

243
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:08,155
Well done.

244
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:30,635
Look at me.

245
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:39,035
Stop struggling.

246
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,515
Finish the final play with me.

247
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:44,476
Then, I'll let you meet
your beloved Tan Jiao again.

248
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:51,356
Let go of me.

249
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:53,956
Tan Jiao.

250
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:56,315
Let go of me!

251
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:58,515
Tan Jiao!

252
00:15:58,596 --> 00:15:59,356
Wu Yu.

253
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,395
Zhou Wei killed Tan Jiao!

254
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:02,675
Are you alright, Tan Jiao?

255
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,756
Wake up!

256
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:04,476
Tan Jiao.

257
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,476
Tan Jiao.

258
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:06,996
Let go of me!

259
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:09,795
Wu Yu.

260
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,356
Zhou Wei is very dangerous now.

261
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:14,315
Zhou Wei.

262
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:24,716
Wu Yu?

263
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:27,196
What are you doing?

264
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,035
Wu Yu, you've mistaken.

265
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:29,956
It's Zhou Wei.

266
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,275
I finally got you.

267
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,116
Duan Yunying.

268
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:45,395
Zhou Wei.

269
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:46,675
Zhou Wei!

270
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,116
I command you

271
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:49,435
to kill them both now!

272
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:49,996
Hurry up!

273
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,315
Wu Yu.

274
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:07,795
For all this time,

275
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,595
you've been controlling the others
with this, don't you?

276
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:12,835
How did you know that?

277
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,795
We've already known about the necklace.

278
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,835
We just didn't expect

279
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,115
that space-time folding would occur

280
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,075
at the moment we took the necklace off.

281
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,035
I've asked Zhou Wei about it.

282
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:26,835
But he didn't know

283
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,436
who the real culprit was.

284
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,515
That's why we set this up.

285
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,196
Well done.

286
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,075
But I really can't understand.

287
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:47,075
Why would you

288
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,875
come after me again and again?

289
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:50,716
You know what?

290
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:52,835
Previously,

291
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:56,595
I really treated you two

292
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:00,916
as my brother and sister.

293
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:22,515
I didn't expect

294
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,476
to obtain the memory of the future

295
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,196
at the moment I touched the crystal.

296
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:47,396
Stop it!

297
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,476
I saw you both

298
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,875
traveled through time again and again.

299
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,756
You even tried to rescue
those four sluts.

300
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:06,996
I certainly have to get rid of you
in advance.

301
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:20,676
So,

302
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,275
you're the friend of Ren Jie?

303
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:24,115
That's right.

304
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:25,436
You killed those four girls

305
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,035
just to avenge Ren Jie?

306
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:28,875
But you shifted the blame

307
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:30,795
on Zhou Wei,

308
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:32,956
making him a scapegoat?

309
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:33,996
Of course.

310
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,875
Get up!

311
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,676
I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:40,476
But why did you

313
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:41,676
command me to kill Chen Xingjian?

314
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:42,396
Why?

315
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,156
It was him who rushed forward.

316
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:45,875
Tan Jiao was the one I wanted to kill!

317
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,756
What is this?

318
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,396
What happened to me?

319
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:09,035
Zhou Wei.

320
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:11,515
Look at me.

321
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:23,476
Slap yourself.

322
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:28,515
Enough.

323
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:30,956
Let's split up later.

324
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:34,795
You go outside the cave
and set up a trap in secret.

325
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:54,275
Let's go.

326
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:33,676
Zhou Wei!

327
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:34,515
Zhou Wei!

328
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:35,436
Calm down!

329
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,156
Calm down!

330
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:40,676
I know everything you did

331
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,156
was to avenge Ren Jie.

332
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:43,956
But why would you lay a hand on Wu Miao?

333
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:47,115
What has Miao got to do with this?

334
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:49,396
I never thought of killing Miao.

335
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,035
I'm true to Miao.

336
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:55,396
Ren Jie said

337
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:57,115
that she loved ocean.

338
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:58,595
She wished

339
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:01,275
to go on a cruise trip in her life.

340
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:04,355
This used to be a sad trip.

341
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,636
But I didn't expect

342
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:07,476
that God actually allowed me

343
00:23:07,956 --> 00:23:09,396
to run into another girl.

344
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:14,756
My name is Wu Miao.

345
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:16,515
My name is Zhu Yutong.

346
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,156
I like you.

347
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:21,716
You like me too, right?

348
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:26,835
What?

349
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:29,035
She's really like Ren Jie.

350
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:31,436
The moment that I met her,

351
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:33,355
I only knew

352
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:35,236
that it was a blessing from God.

353
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:37,156
He took Ren Jie away.

354
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,515
Yet, He brought Miao to my life.

355
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:41,875
That was the moment I realised

356
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,555
that I could still be happy,

357
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,035
that I could still love someone.

358
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,676
Then, you should live your life well.

359
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,196
Why would you want to kill people?

360
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:50,996
You know nothing.

361
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,756
If I didn't kill those four women

362
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:55,436
to avenge Ren Jie,

363
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:57,795
I wouldn't be able to start a new life.

364
00:23:57,996 --> 00:23:59,196
I'll go and wash my hands.

365
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:00,315
Don't drink it before I come back.

366
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,315
I'll wait for you.

367
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,756
Hello, what's your name?

368
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:28,916
Well, I'll switch one with you.

369
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:45,156
I'll get going.

370
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:46,595
Bye bye.

371
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,515
You're a lunatic.

372
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,315
I'm a lunatic?

373
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:44,555
Think about it.

374
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:46,916
I didn't kill

375
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,716
any one of these four girls
with my own hands.

376
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,875
I still can be a pure man

377
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,956
and live a happy life with Miao.

378
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:56,315
Stop deceiving yourself.

379
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:58,476
Do you think you're innocent by getting

380
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,355
someone to do your dirty work?

381
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:02,115
Have you ever thought

382
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,636
if Miao knew everything you did,

383
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,835
how could she forgive you

384
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:08,115
and

385
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:09,875
herself who has once loved you?

386
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:11,676
She wouldn't have known it.

387
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,676
She wouldn't have known
anything about it!

388
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:14,756
It's all your fault!

389
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,035
You ruin everything!

390
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,115
You deserve to die!

391
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:34,396
Jie,

392
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:38,636
those who did you wrong,

393
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:41,396
I've sent all of them over there for you.

394
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,315
They will personally apologise to you.

395
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:47,515
I know

396
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:50,075
you're a kind person.

397
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,515
I'm sure you'll forgive them.

398
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:54,476
There's one thing

399
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:57,355
I'd like to ask for your forgiveness.

400
00:26:58,476 --> 00:26:59,555
From today onwards,

401
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:01,716
my name is no longer Duan Yunying.

402
00:27:03,476 --> 00:27:04,196
Because

403
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,716
I met a girl.

404
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:10,756
She's very nice to me.

405
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:13,956
Duan Yunying's life

406
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:17,275
is too complicated for her.

407
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:22,795
Why not just let Zhu Yutong

408
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:26,676
live a simple life with her?

409
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:29,835
Goodbye, Duan Yunying.

410
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,035
Goodbye,

411
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:36,236
Jie.

412
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:00,595
Babe,

413
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:02,476
are you in there?

414
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:04,795
Babe?

415
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:07,436
Babe?

416
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,636
I'm very annoyed.

417
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:13,236
Well,

418
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,035
why would Master Qizhu do this?

419
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,795
Today is the first day
of the autograph session.

420
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,875
But she stood us up.

421
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:21,115
Miao,

422
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:23,436
there's plenty of time

423
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:24,956
until our appointed time.

424
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:26,795
Why are you here so early?

425
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:27,595
I was going to

426
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,595
Master Qizhu's autograph session
just now.

427
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:30,956
Yet, she didn't show up.

428
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:32,236
The autograph session

429
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:34,115
was called off.

430
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:36,236
I see.

431
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,595
It's alright.

432
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:40,196
I'll go with you next time.

433
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,676
What's wrong with you?

434
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,756
Why are you all sweaty?

435
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,156
I was cleaning up just now.

436
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:55,115
In such a weather,

437
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:56,196
you'll catch a cold if you dry yourself.

438
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,236
It's okay, never mind.

439
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,035
What is this?

440
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,795
I found it on the street.

441
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:10,996
This...

442
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:27,115
This...

443
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:31,355
This is all...

444
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,156
The... These...

445
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:35,916
Babe,

446
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:37,676
let me explain.

447
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,355
It's not what you think.

448
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:40,476
These are not mine.

449
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,756
The cases on the news are

450
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,555
your doings?

451
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:50,875
It... It really is you.

452
00:30:02,355 --> 00:30:02,875
Miao!

453
00:30:04,716 --> 00:30:05,275
Miao!

454
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:09,716
Miao!

455
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:13,396
Miao.

456
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:15,916
I thought...

457
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:19,756
I thought I'd never see you again.

458
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,355
This is the place where we first met.

459
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:28,355
Do you remember it?

460
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,996
No matter what has happened back then

461
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:45,075
and whatever you've done,
I'll be by your side.

462
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:49,315
Miao.

463
00:31:59,115 --> 00:31:59,996
Turn yourself in.

464
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:23,756
Miao,

465
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:27,236
have you told anyone about it?

466
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:35,436
I promise you.

467
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:37,676
I'll turn myself in.

468
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:41,676
But before that,

469
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,035
I have a request.

470
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:46,595
What is it?

471
00:32:47,795 --> 00:32:48,916
Hold me once more.

472
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,275
Miao,

473
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,996
you'll always be by my side, right?

474
00:33:06,515 --> 00:33:07,196
Forever.

475
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:46,996
Tan Jiao,

476
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:49,555
if it wasn't for you,

477
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:51,035
Duan Yunying would've fulfilled

478
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:52,035
his wish.

479
00:33:52,676 --> 00:33:54,756
And I would've been Zhu Yutong happily.

480
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,636
Your absence
at the autograph session was

481
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:58,115
the reason Miao suddenly came
to my place.

482
00:33:58,115 --> 00:33:59,396
Causing the tragedy to happen.

483
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:01,196
You're responsible for all of this!

484
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:02,515
You're the culprit!

485
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,156
Obviously, you're the lunatic one.

486
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:05,515
Stop making excuses.

487
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:06,676
I'm not making excuses.

488
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,156
To be honest with you.

489
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,795
The last time when you traveled back,

490
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,076
I already knew everything

491
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,076
due to the space-time disruption.

492
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:18,556
So look,

493
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:20,435
have I ever hurt Miao?

494
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:22,076
Have I ever hurt Miao?

495
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:25,036
No wonder in the previous universe,

496
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:27,795
it didn't work in the way
it used to be.

497
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,315
In the previous universe,

498
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,036
Chen Xingjian was dead.

499
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:33,795
So you used Zhou Wei.

500
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:34,995
That's right.

501
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,516
I wanted to let Tan Jiao know

502
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,756
how it feels like to be killed

503
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:41,556
by her own childhood friend.

504
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,995
You're such a pervert.

505
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,196
But weren't you already dead?

506
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:48,395
How could you keep doing bad deeds?

507
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:53,435
It's Heaven's will.

508
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,875
This is so-called
Heaven's vengeance is slow but sure.

To get rid of the evils.

Bullshit!

If I'm not wrong,

high frequency magnetic field,
doesn't it?

514

The so-called controller is

just transmitting
the intracranial message flow

in particles form

517

via the magnetic field.

518
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:29,475
(And you used
the high frequency magnetic field)

519
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:31,556
(to change his
intracranial frequency fluctuation.)

(Kill Tan Jiao.)

(So before you died,)

(the person's intracranial frequency was
already changed.)

530
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:51,315
(That was why Chen Xingjian kept
attacking Tan Jiao.)

531
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,795
Do you want to call the police now?

532
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:08,156
Who... Who are you?

533
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:09,875
Just let Wu Miao go.

534
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,355
I can help you win Wu Yu over.

535
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:14,036
Wh... What?

536

(If you want to know the truth,
come to room 22 in Northeast road alone.)

was still alive.)

(Yet, we neglected you
who was already dead.)

(This is a trick of reincarnation.)

I gave him many chances
but he failed to do that.

There's no pity in his death.

You were using him.

You should rot in hell.

Where is Miao?
