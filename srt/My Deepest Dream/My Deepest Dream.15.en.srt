It's all because of Tan Jiao.

She wants to steal Wu Yu
away from me.

Aren't you already engaged to Yu?

Why does she still steal your man?

after I showed him this.

127

get this photo?

Stop looking at it.

I've finally fallen for someone.

However, someone wants
to steal my loved one from me,

not to mention my parents
who don't support me.

00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,668
Why do they do that to me?

134
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:39,548
Is it wrong that I love Wu Yu?

135
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,028
Is it wrong to force him?

136

No.

137
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,307
You're not wrong.

138
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,228
Although

139
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:50,267
I'm not wise and insightful,

140
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:51,947
however, I know

141
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,908
one has to go to great lengths

142
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,908
to get what one wants,

143
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,788
let alone one's love relationship,
right?

144
00:07:58,468 --> 00:07:59,588
I always think

145
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,827
that Wu Yu and you
are the destined pair.

146
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:03,827
All this chaos that came into being

147
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,307
isn't your fault,

148
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,827
that woman should be blamed instead.

149
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,307
She's a jerk.

150
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:13,307
You're so naive.

151
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,668
That's why she pushes you around.

152
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:18,988
What about this?

153
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,228
I'll think of something

154
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,627
to avenge you.

155
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:27,387
What are you going to do?

156
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:39,108
What are you doing?

157
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:40,228
Let go of her. Are you insane?

158
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,068
Listen to me.

159
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,108
I'll threaten Tan Jiao

160
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,147
to kidnap you

161
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:45,108
and make her a criminal.

162
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:47,387
Therefore, I can avenge you.

163
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:48,027
Most importantly,

164
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,667
Wu Yu will never like her again.

165
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:50,907
Do you understand?

166
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:56,027
Chen Ruying.

167
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:57,267
Couldn't you realise

168
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:58,787
Xu was using you?

He harboured a bad intention
long ago.

00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,787
He's been working in my house
for dozen years.

171
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:06,188
How would I know
this is his true colour?

172
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,867
Regarding Wu Miao's photo,

173
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,267
who sent it to you?

174
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:14,708
I don't know.

175
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:19,108
I was planning to look for her

176
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,348
after the wedding.

177
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,068
Are you in your right mind?

178
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:23,988
How could you use the photo

179
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,188
to threaten Wu Yu

180
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:26,547
instead of reporting this to the police
once you received the photo?

181
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:28,188
Because I love him.

182
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,027
He's the only one
that matters in my life.

183
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,507
The rest means nothing to me.

184
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,507
How could you fathom

185
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,787
our relationship since we were young?

186
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:37,507
What will Wu Yu think of you

187
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:38,907
if something bad

188
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,428
happens to Wu Miao?

189
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,787
This is not love.

190
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,507
You're just selfish.

191
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:44,907
I...

192
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,308
I...

193
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,867
Will we

194
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,828
be tied up here forever?

195
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,147
What do we do now?

196
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,228
Don't cry. We'll be alright.

197
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:03,188
I believe Wu Yu

198
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,348
will find us.

199
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:17,428
Wu Yu.

200
00:10:18,188 --> 00:10:19,988
You went to the police eventually.

201
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,787
I'm so disappointed in you.

202
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,108
I'm so disappointed in you!

203
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,068
What are you doing?

204
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:52,188
Call them

205
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:53,627
to deliver the money here.

206
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,708
Then, I'll burn this place to ground

207
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,228
together with you.

208
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:01,068
Put simply,

209
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,108
I'll buy your silence with your death.

210
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,547
Previously,

211
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,507
you promised to release us
after receiving the money.

212
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,188
What's this?

213
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:11,907
It's potassium cyanide.

214
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:16,228
This is my mercy for you.

215
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:17,867
Do you know that?

216
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:20,188
Being burned to death is such a torment.

217
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:21,907
But with this, it'll end fast

218
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:22,988
and less painful.

219
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:23,667
No.

220
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:24,468
No.

221
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:30,867
No.

222
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,188
No, please.

223
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:35,867
Wait!

224
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:38,188
Hold on.

225
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,027
Hold on.

226
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,907
Since I'm on the brink of death,

227
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,027
can I ask you some questions?

228
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:48,667
So that I might die
as well knowing the truth.

229
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:58,108
Go ahead.

230
00:11:58,507 --> 00:11:59,468
You didn't plan

231
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:02,667
to kill us here,

232
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:05,147
but on the wedding

233
00:12:05,147 --> 00:12:06,308
of Su Wan and Chen Ruying.

234
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,547
Therefore, before you started the plan,

235
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:10,907
you've found a scapegoat.

236
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:13,708
And that's Su Wan.

237
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:14,867
Am I right?

238
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:16,228
How do you know about this?

239
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:19,068
(No wonder in the previous universe,)

240
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:20,387
(everyone died in the fire)

241
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:21,747
(of the wedding.)

242
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:23,027
It's my guess.

243
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:25,547
Guess?

244
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:28,308
You're smart though.

245
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:29,948
I was planning

246
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:31,747
to put the potassium cyanide
in his house

247
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,547
after the wedding.

248
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,468
However, it's fine.

249
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:36,267
I still have some.

250
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,708
(The reason why we couldn't find Su Wan)

251
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,627
(because he was killed by Xu.)

252
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:42,588
(While Professor Chen and Ms. Feng)

253
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,588
(discovered Xu's true colour)

254
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,108
(at last.)

255
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,147
(Hence, they desperately dragged him)

256
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:48,108
(into the burning room.)

257
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,068
Why would you

258
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,228
think of

259
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,588
using potassium cyanide then?

260
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,387
So many victims

261
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:56,348
were murdered in the serial killings
in Jinghai City.

262
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,787
I think the murderer wouldn't mind

263
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,147
taking this blame for me, right?

264
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,747
Hence, everyone's attention
will be on him

265
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:03,948
instead of me.

266
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,547
(Previously, we looked into
these traits)

267
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:07,708
(yet we got no discoveries.)

268
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,547
(It turns out the two cases)

269
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,228
(were committed
by two different persons.)

270
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:13,147
Enough.

271
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:15,907
You already know the truth

272
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:17,348
that you shouldn't know.

273
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,188
Xu Baotian!

274
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:20,867
My parents treat you kindly.

275
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,907
How could you do this to me?

276
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:25,468
Bull!

277
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:27,348
They treat me kindly?

278
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:30,867
I've been working for your family
for dozen years

279
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,867
and I deserve something, right?

280
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:34,667
How could you do that to me?

281
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,387
I just want to pay off

282
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:39,428
for the one-million gambling debt.

283
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,588
I borrowed money from your mother
to save my life.

284
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,027
But she turned me down.

285
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:43,787
Fine.

286
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:45,907
Since you treated me indifferently,

287
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:48,188
I'll make you pay.

288
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,988
My mother did that for your own good.

289
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:53,188
You're just like those children
born with a silver spoon in their mouth.

290
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,147
The way your mother talks
rubs off on you.

291
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,787
You just want us to torture.

292
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,027
Nonsense!

293
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:00,747
That's just sick.

294
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,747
Help!

295
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:03,708
Help!

296
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,387
Help!

297
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:05,588
Is anyone out there?

298
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:08,507
- We're here!
- Save us, please!

299
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,588
- Help!
- Tan.

300
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:11,068
I knew

301
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,907
you were trying to buy time

302
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,747
while you were asking me questions.

303
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:15,547
Good.

304
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:16,708
If that's the case,

305
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:18,147
I'll start with you first.

306
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,507
- Help!
- Help!

307
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:21,188
Stop it.

308
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:24,308
Wu Yu.

309
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:25,228
Wu Yu.

310
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:26,907
How did you find me?

311
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:28,588
You led me here.

312
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:29,828
That's impossible.

313
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,428
The kidnapper is able to put the camera
in Chen's house,

314
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,507
so it must be someone
who can enter the house freely.

315
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:34,948
Professor and Mrs Chen

316
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,507
didn't go out alone,

317
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,068
they were always accompanied
by the police.

318
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,147
Only you,

319
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:43,228
the driver can go in and out
of the house freely.

320
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,588
Therefore, I followed you here.

321
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,188
You're the most likely one.

322
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:07,588
Hello.

323
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:08,507
Hello, Wu Yu.

324
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:09,948
We found that the driver, Xu Baotian

325
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:11,267
is highly suspicious.

326
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:12,348
Is he in the house now?

327
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,108
He's on his way out.

328
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:14,988
I'll tail him.

329
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,108
I send you the location.

330
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:16,667
Move now.

331
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:20,627
I see.

332
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:23,068
Well, both of you are smart.

333
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,787
But do you think you alone

334
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:26,267
can stop me?

335
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:27,787
Who says I came here alone?

336
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:40,228
Watch out, Wu Yu!

337
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:41,627
Watch out, Wu Yu!

338
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,308
Untie Ying.

339
00:15:58,387 --> 00:15:58,907
Leave now.

340
00:15:59,387 --> 00:15:59,867
Hurry up.

341
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,108
Hurry up.

342
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:04,787
Let's go.

343
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:11,188
Hurry up, Chen Ruying.

344
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:13,228
Faster, Ying.

345
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:15,867
Chen Ruying.

346
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:16,828
Stand right there.

347
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:17,387
Ying.

348
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:18,907
Get up.

349
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,507
Run, Ying.

350
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:21,787
Tan Jiao.

351
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:27,747
Watch out, Wu Yu.

352
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,428
Wu Yu.

353
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:37,588
Wu Yu.

354
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:45,228
Wu Yu.

355
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:46,867
Are you alright?

356
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,507
I'm fine.

357
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:50,147
Don't worry about me.

358
00:16:57,547 --> 00:16:58,507
You knew

359
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:00,188
how dangerous is the liquid

360
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:01,308
in this syringe.

361
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:02,627
Don't strain yourself.

362
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:04,428
You can't protect her anymore

363
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,067
when your blood is drained off.

364
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,347
Don't be pleased too early.

365
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,107
The police are arriving soon.

366
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:12,107
Don't you look down on me.

367
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:13,507
Do you think this place

368
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:14,747
can be found easily?

369
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,188
It'll take them two to three hours

370
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:18,547
to search around this area.

371
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:19,908
They'll only see your corpses

372
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,267
when they arrive.

373
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:22,827
Let's go down then.

374
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,628
The liquid of potassium cyanide

375
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:29,747
is highly volatile

376
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:31,747
when it's exposed to the air

377
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,307
and then produces hydrogen cyanide.

378
00:17:34,668 --> 00:17:37,468
If one breathes in the gas,

379
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,868
he will die from hypoxia
within three minutes.

380
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,267
Are you intimidating me?

381
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:44,827
I don't have much knowledge.

382
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:46,948
But you can't dupe me

383
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:47,948
with such nonsense.

384
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:49,107
At first,

385
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:52,148
after the gas contacts your skin,

386
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,307
the skin turns purple,

387
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,587
your eyes get irritated,

388
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:01,428
and you feel numbness
in your lips and throat.

389
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:05,188
Next, your blood pressure runs low

390
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,468
and you'll suffer dizziness and nausea.

391
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:10,067
If the exposure expands,

392
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,267
you'll feel short of breath
and lose control of your muscle

393
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,347
until you die of suffocation.

394
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:16,428
By the way,

395
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,428
do you have

396
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,787
the taste of bitter almonds
in your mouth?

397
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:23,908
It's the symptom
after you inhale hydrogen cyanide.

398
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:31,507
This is the end for us both.

399
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:34,107
I didn't expect you're a maniac.

400
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,067
But I won't let you drag me down.

401
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,428
You two may die here
if you're seeking death.

402
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,107
That saves me from trouble anyway.

403
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:48,107
Let's leave.

404
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:48,908
Faster, Wu Yu.

405
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:49,948
Let's go out here to seek help.

406
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:50,507
Come on.

407
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:51,908
It's fine, Tan Jiao.

408
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:54,027
I tricked him.

409
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:56,948
A small amount of hydrogen cyanide
won't kill us.

410
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:58,868
But, we're still in danger.

411
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:00,747
I...I know where to go.

412
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:01,547
Come with me.

413
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:02,347
Come with me.

414
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:03,628
Come on.

415
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:05,307
Slow down.

416
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:12,547
Be careful.

417
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:14,067
Be careful.

418
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:23,468
Sit down first.

419
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,067
Sit down here.

420
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:26,908
Lean on the wall.

421
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:28,708
Be careful.

422
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:31,988
Careful.

423
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,027
Wu Yu.

424
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:44,708
Wu Yu.

425
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,188
How do you feel now?

426
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:48,787
Tan Jiao.

427
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:50,027
My phone.

428
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:51,948
My phone.

429
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,100
(No service)

430
00:19:57,827 --> 00:19:58,587
No way.

431
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:00,188
No signal.

432
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:03,827
Press it, Wu Yu.

433
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:02,468
You have to hang in there.

434
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:10,948
Please bear it, Wu Yu.

435
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:12,787
Bear the pain.

436
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:16,787
The bleeding has stopped.

437
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,587
But I fear that you'll get infected.

438
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:22,468
I'm fine.

439
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:24,587
Don't laugh.

440
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,347
What if it triggers inflammation?

441
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:29,827
I'm fine.

442
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:31,988
Press it.

443
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,507
Press it.

444
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:52,347
I found a first aid box.

445
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,628
On January 24th, 2022

446
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:04,827
Xu would chamber you in a warehouse.

447
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:05,747
Don't be afraid.

448
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:06,908
The medicine is in the box.

449
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,900
(Tan Jiao, come to me.)

450
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,628
(The handwritings are the same.)

451
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,827
(Who left this note for me)

452
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,307
(in the warehouse again?)

453
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,860
(Anti-inflammatory tablets)

454
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:33,067
Take the medicine first.

455
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:57,668
Hang in, please.

456
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,347
Wu Yu.

457
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,908
Wu Yu. Tan Jiao.

458
00:23:29,587 --> 00:23:30,988
I know you're inside.

459
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:32,988
Come out.

460
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:37,908
Come out.

461
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,267
Wu Yu.

462
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:40,908
You were bold, weren't you?

463
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:42,468
Why are you hiding now?

464
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:43,868
You're so timid.

465
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:45,668
Come out.

466
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:49,307
Come out.

467
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:52,988
Fine.

468
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,188
You want to wind up together, right?

469
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,067
Fine. I'll fulfil your wish.

470
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,107
Alright.

471
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:09,428
Wait for me.

472
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,107
The place ahead
is where Wu Yu mentioned.

473
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:25,827
Check if

474
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:26,908
you could track
his handphone's location.

475
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:27,547
Alright.

476
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:32,708
It doesn't work, Captain Shen.

477
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:34,708
The district ahead is a dead zone.

478
00:24:34,988 --> 00:24:36,148
Signals are blocked.

479
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:41,468
Request for reinforcement immediately.

480
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:42,067
Yes.

481
00:24:47,908 --> 00:24:48,507
Wu Yu.

482
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:50,668
You're awake.

483
00:24:53,468 --> 00:24:54,747
How do you feel now?

484
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,347
Does it still hurt?

485
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,027
Thank you, Tan Jiao.

486
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:05,787
It's great that you're fine.

487
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,827
Where did you get the bandage
and medicine?

488
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:10,188
Oh, right.

489
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:14,027
Look at this.

490
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:15,787
The handwriting on this note

491
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:17,668
is the same as the one I received

492
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:18,787
in Dali.

493
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:21,188
What's wrong?

494
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:27,347
We're saved.

495
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:30,188
What do you mean?

496
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:34,468
Give me that.

497
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:36,188
This one?

498
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,908
But the phone is broken

499
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:40,428
and no signals in this place.

500
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,107
It's a satellite phone

501
00:25:44,027 --> 00:25:45,388
and it doesn't depend on the network.

502
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:48,668
We can notify others our location then.

503
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:50,787
I just can't believe

504
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:52,388
what has happened.

505
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:55,307
It feels like

506
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:57,188
there's a saviour

507
00:25:57,948 --> 00:25:59,668
arranging all these for us.

508
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:01,708
There's no such a saviour.

509
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,908
Only we can save ourselves.

510
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:07,468
A distress signal is detected.

511
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:08,587
A distress signal is detected.

512
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:09,988
The location is the warehouse
in the eastern suburbs.

513
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:11,267
The location is the warehouse
in the eastern suburbs.

514
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,347
Move out.

515
00:26:12,628 --> 00:26:13,428
Ready for rescue.

516
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,027
The pair of you

517
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:21,507
like to stay inside, right?

518
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:22,307
What do we do now, Wu Yu?

519
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:23,827
I'll grant your wish.

520
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:25,708
I'll burn you to death.

521
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,587
Enjoy your time here.

522
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:48,988
What do we do now?

523
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,307
Help.

524
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:08,708
Help.

525
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:10,148
Help.

526
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:12,307
Chen Ruying.

527
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,267
Are you alright?

528
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:13,948
Why are you here?

529
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:14,708
Where are they?

530
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,067
Wu Yu is still inside.

531
00:27:17,547 --> 00:27:19,428
Please rescue them.

532
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,107
Huang, take her to the car. Faster.

533
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:21,628
Yes.

534
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:22,428
Careful.

535
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:37,787
Tan Jiao.

Today is January 24th.

537
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,307
Fifteen days have passed.

538
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,908
We're coming back soon.

539
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:49,428
You'll be fine.

540
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:51,067
I won't allow anything bad
to happen to you.

541
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,188
We'll be saved.

542
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:54,747
We'll go out together.

543
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:56,388
I promise.

544
00:27:57,988 --> 00:27:59,428
We'll be fine.

545
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:14,507
Wu Yu.

546
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:19,347
Wu Yu, please don't scare me.

We're here.

561
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:44,067
We're here!

562

Wu Yu, please hold on.

567

You'll be alright soon.

569

Just hang in.

Three minutes more.

572
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:13,708

639
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:16,187
I'll die if you keep pressing.

640
00:34:16,227 --> 00:34:18,067
You scared me.

How's your injury?

642
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:28,908
I'm not injured in this universe.

643
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,627
Great.

644
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,667
You scared me to death.

645
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,147
I thought you have died.

646
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:46,627
Do you get hurt?

647
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:49,227
I'm fine.

648
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:53,828
But...

649
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:56,707
but...

650
00:34:58,828 --> 00:34:59,707
but why

651
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:01,268
are we here?

652
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:05,748
Perhaps we got washed up here.

653
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:08,388
What about

654
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:10,388
the others on the boat

655
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:11,788
and Miao?

656
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:13,507
What has happened to them?

657
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:14,948
Perhaps they were

658
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:16,667
swept up to the island like us.

659
00:35:17,147 --> 00:35:18,348
Let's find along the shore.

660
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:23,468
Where should we go now?

661
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:26,828
Let's go to the front.

662
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:30,428
Careful.

663

No.

666
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:55,627
I want to look for Wu Yu.

667
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:56,788
Be careful.

668
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:57,988

669

670
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:00,627
We're fine.

671

Wu Yu.

672
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,187
Are any of you injured?

Chen Ruying.

They're all here.

676
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:10,348
Are you alright, Tan Jiao?

677
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:11,428
We're fine.

678
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:12,948
Do you get hurt?

679
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:13,748
We're good.

680
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,147
Luckily, everyone is in one piece.

681
00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:16,468
But the boat capsized.

682
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:18,348
Has anyone seen Wu Miao?

683
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:20,507
I saw Professor Chen and her

684
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:21,828
being rescued by someone
from the cruise.

685
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:23,147
As long as she's fine.

686
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:23,988
Wu Yu.

687
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:24,587
Come on, Tan Jiao.

688
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:25,147
Be careful.

689
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:25,667
Are you alright?

690
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,268
I'm not fine at all.

691
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,227
If he insisted on

692
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:32,308
rescuing the minors first,

693
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:33,908
we wouldn't be here.

694
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:35,547
Can we abandon the minors?

695
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,308
You're really...

696
00:36:37,748 --> 00:36:38,348
Ying.

697
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:39,788
Don't chip in.

698
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:40,388
Come here.

699
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:43,908
Careful.

700
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,187
How's the boat?

701
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:51,388
The engine is broken.

702
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,187
I checked the communication equipment

703
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:54,268
and it's broken too.

704
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,388
Let's go and check it out.

705
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:01,587
Your handphone can't work too.

706
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:02,388
There's no signal here.

707
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:10,388
Are we going

708
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:12,147
to wait on the boat till we die?

709
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:13,507
No, I want...

710
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:14,027
Enough.

711
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,027
Cut it out. Keep quiet.
