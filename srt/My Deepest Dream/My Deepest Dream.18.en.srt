She stays in residence,

Want me to check on her for you?

152
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,874
I can pretend that I'm looking for
inspiration for my new novel,

do some research with me
or something like that.

155

Everyone was an astronomer.

00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,034
Yes.

172
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:06,234
You were adorable.

173
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:11,794
We have a family tradition

174
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,394
to take a family photo every two years.

175
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:16,673
But our family is getting smaller.

176
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:18,634
It won't get smaller.

177
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:20,673
After we save Miao,

178
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,673
and after you all get married
in a couple of years,

179
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,713
your family will grow again.

180
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:27,474
When that day comes,
it will be beautiful.

181
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,260
(Subway, Underground Market)

182
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,234
Miao.

183
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:36,434
I'm going to the bar tonight
to collect the tickets.

184
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:37,874
Can you still come out?

185
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:39,354
I don't know.

186
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,593
My brother is not doing well right now.

187
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,474
When I got up at 3:00 a.m. yesterday,

188
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,034
I saw that the light
was still on in his room.

189
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,474
He was probably crying behind our backs.

190
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,713
What exactly happened?

191
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,073
What would anger Jiao so much?

192
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:58,154
Could it be that...

193
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:01,673
Wu Yu cheated on her?

194
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:04,793
My brother may seem aloof,

195
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,513
but he's fully committed
when he falls in love.

196
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:07,113
He's completely loyal.

197
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:08,833
He wishes he could
give her the whole world.

198
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,073
That's true.

199
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,953
What else could he have done wrong then?

200
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:14,833
I can't have this.

201
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:15,753
I can't just stand by and watch

202
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,313
my brother lose the love of his life.

203
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:18,434
I've never seen my brother

204
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,514
fall in love with anyone before.

205
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:21,713
I have to help him.

206
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:23,593
How?

207
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:29,913
I don't even have Master Qizhu's number.

208
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,193
I need to talk to her face to face.

209
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,793
Well, you can find her number
in Wu Yu's phone.

210
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:40,113
Babe,

211
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:41,553
you are so smart.

212
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:42,514
Let's go.

213
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:43,833
Let's go eat something good.

214
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:44,353
Let's go.

215
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:44,913
Come on.

216
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:46,474
Easy.

217
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:50,154
This

218
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,234
is Xu Jingmiao's route home
after her night shift.

219
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:53,593
The red dots are security cameras.

220
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,673
If he wants to make a move,

221
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,474
(Jinshanbang Garden)
then the best area to do it is here.

222
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,593
Because this area has no camera.

223
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:02,514
Not just that,

224
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,353
this area is relatively concealed.

225
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,073
If something happens,
no one will notice it.

226
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:08,673
Looks like this guy is very smart

227
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:10,394
and meticulous.

228
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,833
What's next?

229
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:14,274
What should we do?

230
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:15,394
I already have a plan,

231
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,313
but I need the help of one person.

232
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,073
Shen Shiyan?

233
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,313
Are you planning to tell him the truth?

234
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,034
I think we can trust him.

235
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:26,833
Okay then.

236
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,994
We will go find him tomorrow night.

237
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,193
Do me a favor, hide now.

238
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:37,354
Why?

239
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:38,154
Come on.

240
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:39,673
It's Miao. Why should I...

241
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:41,073
Brother,

242
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,514
I got back one day earlier.

243
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,833
That's early.

244
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:47,913
Brother,

245
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,274
what are you doing?

246
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:51,593
I'm thinking about something.

247
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:52,833
Brother, you can't keep this up.

248
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:53,473
Stay back!

249
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:54,673
Just stand there.

250
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,673
I need some time alone.

251
00:11:57,713 --> 00:11:58,274
Miao,

252
00:11:59,073 --> 00:11:59,874
I'm thirsty.

253
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:01,514
Can you get me a glass of water?

254
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:06,593
Wu Yu,

255
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:07,913
what's going on?

256
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:09,513
It's a long story,

257
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:10,634
I can't explain it now.

258
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:11,713
Just do me a favor.

259
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:12,554
Hide first, okay?

260
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:13,313
Please, please.

261
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,553
Brother, listen...

262
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,194
Sit there.

263
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:20,873
No matter what misunderstanding
you and Tan Jiao have,

264
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,034
I'm sure you can work it out.

265
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:22,754
Don't worry.

266
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:23,994
Brother,

267
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,913
why did you guys break up?

268
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:26,833
Break up?

269
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:29,433
It's a long story.

270
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,154
But it's all my fault.

271
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:33,793
Do you still love her?

272
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,553
Keep out of the adults' business.

273
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:37,913
Why should I keep out?

274
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:40,913
Your girlfriend
is my future sister-in-law,

275
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,114
my family.

276
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,953
And I don't have a say in this?

277
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:46,474
Just tell me if you still love her.

278
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:49,874
I love...

279
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:52,634
Loved her.

280
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,073
I don't get it.

281
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:00,754
Since you still love her,

282
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:02,474
then you should get her back.

283
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:04,794
We are doing fine now.

284
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,233
It's fine. Just leave it be.

285
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:07,354
Just leave it be?

286
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:08,674
I'm telling you,

287
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,194
you will never meet another girl

288
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:11,914
as gentle and interesting
as Master Qizhu.

289
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,754
Think about all the girls
that courted you before.

290
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,873
Like Wang Nana in seventh grade,

291
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:16,913
she was scheming.

292
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,994
She often pretended to be sick, so that
you could carry her to the infirmary.

293
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:20,633
And Fang Ting in high school...

294
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:21,473
Enough, enough.

295
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:22,873
Her food was awful in
taste and appearance.

296
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:23,833
Yet she made you lunch every day.

297
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,673
There was also Wang Xiaolu in college,

298
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:26,993
she's got a great body,
but she's empty-headed.

299
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:27,674
She got herself drunk,

300
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:28,913
- trying to seduce you.
- That's enough.

301
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:30,833
And there is Chen Ruying...

302
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:32,313
Stop.

303
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:37,073
The point is

304
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,554
Master Qizhu is the best girl

305
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:40,874
you've ever met.

306
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:42,474
You hear that?

307
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:44,793
I agree on that.

308
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,354
That's for sure.

309
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:48,114
Brother,

310
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,313
I feel a little hungry.

311
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,433
Make some noodles for me.

312
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:54,913
But I'm not feeling well now.

313
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:55,753
Are you feeling sad again?

314
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,554
I feel really sad now.

315
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:58,073
I...

316
00:13:58,553 --> 00:13:59,073
You... You...

317
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,194
What are you doing?

318
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,074
Let go of me.

319
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,673
The pain of my breakup is torturing me.

320
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:03,513
My hair...

321
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,114
Stay here with me for a bit.

322
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,154
Brother...

323
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:10,313
It's hard for me,

324
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,513
but I can't let my sister starve,

325
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:12,193
right?

326
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,634
So, I'm going to
make you something to eat,

327
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:15,953
but you can't move.

328
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,274
You have to sit here,

329
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:18,073
got it?

330
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:19,354
It's settled then.

331
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:22,713
Be a good girl.

332
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,034
Don't walk away.

333
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:35,593
Brother,

334
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:37,154
if you want to apologize,

335
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,234
shouldn't you talk to Tan Jiao?

336
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,713
How should I apologize?

337
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:44,434
(Enter password)
You can send her gifts,

338
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,953
flowers and stuff.

339
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,673
(Incorrect password)
Just say something nice to her.

340
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:51,593
Like "I can't live without you,"

341
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,593
or something like,

342
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:56,553
"You are the light of my life."

343
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,073
(Voice dialing)
Call Tan Jiao.

344
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:06,433
(Can't find Tan Jiao in your contacts.)

345
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:09,433
Call Honey.

346

(Error)
(Can't find Honey in your contacts.)

347
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,833
Call Jiaojiao.

348
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,860
(Jiaojiao)

349
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,994
That's so corny.

350
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:31,993
(Sorry,)

351
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:33,994
(the number you dialed is switched off.)

352
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:36,553
She won't answer
and has turned off her phone.

353
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:38,514
Things are a little serious.

354
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:43,713
What are you doing?

355
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,474
Why are you acting suspiciously?

356
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,433
I'm not acting suspiciously.

357
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:50,193
I'm talking to you.

358
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,634
I just thought of a way to apologize.

359
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,114
Help me fold some paper stars.

360
00:15:58,593 --> 00:15:59,394
I just thought about

361
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:00,233
what you said to me.

362
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:01,193
I think you were right.

363
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:02,674
I can't give up. I have to persevere.

364
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,634
So, I want to fold 1,000 paper stars,

365
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:06,394
but I don't have enough time.

366
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:07,554
Help me fold the stars, okay?

367
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,713
Folding paper stars?

368
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:12,034
What are you? An old fashioned
elementary school student?

369
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:14,674
But your Master Qizhu
loves something like this.

370
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:15,593
I'm sure of it.

371
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:16,954
So, go back to your room now.

372
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:17,914
Fold it while you eat.

373
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,593
You have to make 200 stars today.

374
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:20,873
- 200.
- Thank you, thank you.

375
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:22,833
Am I a child labor
in an illegal factory?

376
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:23,833
You can do it! You can do it!

377
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:24,673
Fold it seriously.

378
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,833
Go on, Miao.

379
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:26,433
You can do it.

380
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:44,394
I can explain.

381
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:45,274
Mr. Wu Yu,

382
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,433
that was a lot of information.

383
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,593
You've got quite a rich dating history.

384
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:52,073
Shut it.

385
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:54,034
After we see Xu Jingmiao tonight,

386
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:56,553
we will have
a serious conversation about this.

387
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:57,713
I should go now.

388
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:02,114
See you tonight.

389
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:02,994
Bye bye.

390
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,474
(Do you usually get off at 7:00 p.m.?)

391
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,194
I began working the night shift
after February 3rd.

392
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:12,553
I get off work at 2:00 a.m..

393
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,153
2:00 a.m.!

394
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:15,994
That's so late.

395
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,234
Aren't you afraid of going home alone?

396
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:19,234
No.

397
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,233
There are cameras everywhere
in this city.

398
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:22,234
What's there to be afraid of?

399
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:24,834
Your boyfriend's here.

400
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:25,714
Hi.

401
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:28,194
(Another dozen of beers, please!)

402
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:30,194
You guys enjoy. It'll be my treat today.

403
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:31,113
I have to get back to work.

404
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:36,833
Sorry for being late.

405
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:38,073
Well, Wu Miao was...

406
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,793
Let's talk about the breakup first.

407
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:44,514
I haven't had time to explain this.

408
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,073
I was trying to distract Wu Miao.

409
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:48,113
It's a lie.

410
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:53,633
I remember you told Wu Miao that

411
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:55,474
you are the one at fault.

412
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,393
We were acting, weren't we?

413
00:17:58,754 --> 00:17:59,793
Answer me this then.

414
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:02,034
If I do something wrong one day,

415
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:03,833
but I don't want to apologize to you,

416
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:05,793
will you come to apologize to me first?

417
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:06,474
I will.

418
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:08,793
Will you really?

419
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:10,153
No matter what you do,

420
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:12,034
I will never be mad at you.

421
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:23,954
You two look so sweet.

422
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,073
So I took a picture.

423
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:26,514
Here, you can have it.

424
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:27,833
Thank you.

425
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,793
We need to shake it, right?

426
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:32,394
Blow on it.

427
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:33,393
Shake it a little.

428
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:35,274
It shows, it shows.

429
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:49,353
Miao, I'm here.

430
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:50,393
Sorry for being late.

431
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,073
My brother was keeping me home.

432
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:53,833
Have you brought the stuff?

433
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:54,633
Yes.

434
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:56,513
I have this in my shop.

435
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,313
I thought it wasn't enough.

436
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:58,514
So I bought some more online.

437
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,513
Good job.

438
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:00,113
Will this be enough?

439
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:00,793
Yes, yes.

440
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,393
This is enough for
my brother to break up three times.

441
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,793
But is Wu Yu really going to use this

442
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:07,954
to win back Tan Jiao?

443
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:09,073
Who knows?

444
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,474
My brother is being weird this time.

445
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:11,793
Let's go and collect the tickets now.

446
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,313
If we go home late,

447
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,153
I'm going to be in trouble.

448
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:14,793
Let's go.

449
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:15,393
Let's go.

450
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:20,434
Why is it so dark in here?

451
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,593
It's crowded.

452
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,274
Are there any seats left?

453
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:25,553
No, you...

454
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:27,274
It's so expensive.

455
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,393
Miao is here.

456
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:36,713
I told you,

457
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,393
don't come to me again.

458
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:40,313
It's over between us.

459
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,274
Why won't you stop pestering me?

460
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:45,153
I'm sick of this!

461
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,353
Master Qizhu...

462
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:52,793
Brother, you...

463
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:55,313
Miaomiao!

464
00:19:58,593 --> 00:19:59,273
Wu... Wu Yu,

465
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:00,274
don't worry.

466
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:01,313
I'll check on them.

467
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:13,393
Master Qizhu!

468
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:16,113
Master Qizhu!

469
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,274
Master Qizhu, wait.

470
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:23,113
I'd like to apologize to you
on behalf on my brother.

471
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:28,313
Consider it as a favor for me.

472
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,833
Consider it as you're putting me
out of my misery.

473
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:31,553
How about this?

474
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,353
See you tomorrow
at 12:00 p.m. at Central Mall.

475
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:34,994
I will wait until you show up.

476

477
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,393
actually...

478
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,553
I won't accept a no.

479
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,513
Tomorrow at noon.

480
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:40,394
You have to come.

481
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:41,274
You have to.

482
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,313
I will wait until you show up.

483

Remember to come.

484

You have to come.

485
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,153
Captain Shen,

486
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,034
here's the security footage
you asked for.

487
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:01,113
Okay.

488
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,634
Are the bar's security cameras on

489

24 hours?

490
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:06,434
Yes.

491
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:08,073
Our cameras are on.

492
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,194
The security level in this area
has increased lately.

493

Okay.

May I see your ID?

Do I know you?

521
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:10,393
We've known each other
for a long time, sort of.

522
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:12,553
I've never seen you before.

523

Your trick doesn't work on me.

please show me your ID.

Wu Yu,

527

You know each other?

do you really know him?

531
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,113
He has no bad intention towards you?

532
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:25,393
Of course.

533
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,313
He saved my life this morning.

534
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,393
I should get back to work.

535

Zhuang Yu.

542
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:04,553
What have you been up to all day?

543
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,073
You didn't answer my call.

Please don't disturb me.

545

There are only a few books left.

546
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:09,474
I'm almost done.

547
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:11,714
Let me see.

548
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:15,153
Evolution of the Planets.

549
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:17,313
I've finally finished signing them.

550
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:19,674
My arms are going to break.

551
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:22,153
Do you know that I was taken
to the police station today

552
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:23,434
because of the mission you gave me?

553
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:24,994
I was only released in the evening.

554
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:27,313
As soon as I came out, I had to sign
over 1,000 copies of this.

555
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,553
I'm exhausted.

556
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,434
You were caught?

557
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:31,954
Well, yeah.

558
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:33,274
They accused me as a thief.

559
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:37,234
If a handsome officer
hadn't defended me,

560
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:38,833
I would've been in a big trouble.

561
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,474
Hang on.

562
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:43,754
What's with the handsome officer?

563
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:46,073
Shouldn't you show concern

564
00:23:46,153 --> 00:23:47,313
about my safety first?

565
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:49,474
A young girl almost became
a victim of great injustice,

566
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:51,793
or a beautiful writer was imprisoned,
or something like that.

567
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:55,154
Didn't you just tell me
a knight saved you?

568
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,754
That means
nothing too bad happened to you.

569
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:58,994
I am more concerned about

570
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:00,674
the knight who saved
the damsel in distress.

571
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,153
Tell me about it.

572
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:05,674
It's just a chance encounter.

573
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,714
He didn't even leave me his contact.

574
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,080
He's probably a staid guy.

575
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:17,714
Why do I sense a hint of
disappointment in your voice?

576
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:22,153
Yes.

577
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,754
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

578
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:26,633
Forget it.

579
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:28,033
How were you guys doing today?

580
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:28,873
Did it go well?

581
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:32,313
We already know the victim's route.

582
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:33,553
And we have a plan.

583
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,394
We're meeting our cop friend tomorrow

584
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,234
to ask for his help.

585
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:37,954
Oh, right,

586
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,113
do you want to join us tomorrow?

587
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,954
He's a handsome officer too.

588
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:47,954
Once you've seen the best,
nobody can be better than him.

589
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,994
The gap between the officers is large.

590
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:52,994
Maybe

591
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,194
it's different in this case.

592
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:44,553
Walk faster.

593
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:48,274
Look.

594
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:54,434
Brother,

595
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,793
that's all I can do for you.

596
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:58,073
Last night, I tried my best

597
00:25:58,153 --> 00:25:59,313
to beg

598
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,954
until Master Qizhu agreed to come out.

599
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:03,674
Go now.

600
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:06,474
Do as I told you.

601
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:08,473
Move her with all your heart.

602
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,393
Get her back.

603
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:14,593
Have a proper attitude.

604
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:17,954
Alright, I got it.

605
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,393
I will talk to her with sincerity.

606
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:19,994
Go.

607
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:34,113
Tan Jiao,

608
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,393
I want to win you back with my heart.

609
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:40,274
Will you forgive me?

610
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:44,793
But how come

611
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:45,833
I can't see your heart?

612
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:49,073
What?

613
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:50,514
You think

614
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:53,633
you can win me back

615
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:55,514
with just a flower bouquet
and some stars?

616
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:01,874
I remember Miao taught you
a lot of nice words

617
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,394
that you can say to me yesterday.

618
00:27:03,474 --> 00:27:04,234
Why aren't you saying them?

619
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:12,873
She said it quite well.

620
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:18,553
Can't you improvise a little?

621
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:19,914
I'm the one who was dumped.

622
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:21,393
I won't break up with you.

623
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,234
I told you,

624
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:24,994
I will never let go of you.

625
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:36,034
Fine.

626
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:38,553
I will forgive you for now.

627
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:44,553

Hello, babe.

I have something
to do at school today.

I won't be able to pick you up.

Come on, be a good girl.

Come back.

644
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:30,154
I told you, I want iced coffee.

645
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:30,914
Iced coffee.

I have to deal with something.

I will call you back.

You call this iced coffee?

653
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:43,633
Drink it. See if it's iced coffee.

654
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:44,753
This is just cold coffee.

655
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,234
How is this iced coffee
if there is no ice?

656
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,194
I'm sorry.

What are you looking at?

658
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:54,754
It's my right
to criticize her poor service.

659
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,353
Stop trying to play victim.

660

Know when to stop.

I can't see her.

You looked pretty smart yesterday.

Why aren't you saying anything now?

Tell me, what do you want me to write?

No...

Nothing special.

691
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:04,273
I just dropped by today.

I knew that my life was no longer mine,

I love you so much.

No!

Wait,

Why "no"?

717

No reason.

718
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:30,914
It's a personal grudge
between him and me.

719
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:32,113
So...

720
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,033
You don't want me to say yes to him,

721
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:34,714
right?

722
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:35,593
Yes.

723
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:36,834
Why are you interrupting?

724
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:37,714
You listen to me...

725

I was worried that
there are new bad guys in the venue.

New bad guys?

I've asked a girl out to dinner.

I was worried that

you would be busy.

740
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:45,954

my market is bad?

No, no.

That's not what I meant.

Sorry.

Sure.

751
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,234
One day, five yuan was kidnapped.

752
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:10,153
The kidnapper then called
ten yuan and said,

"Hello,

I'll tear him up now."

"Go on then.

you will lose five yuan too."

Sorry.

762

It's not funny at all, right?

763
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:32,713
No wonder after I told this
to another girl last time,

764

she blew me off.

girlfriend, look,

842
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:02,233
I really had no idea this staid guy

843
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:04,514
was your

844
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:07,233
blind date.

845
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:08,113
Tan Jiao.

846
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,473
I fell in love with
your good friend Zhou Xiaoyu

847
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:11,434
at first sight.

848
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:12,153
I'd like to court her.

849
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:13,153
That should be fine, right?

850
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:15,273
What are you doing?

851
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:17,113
O-Of course it's fine.

852
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:17,834
It's definitely fine.

853
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,073
Why wouldn't it be fine?

854
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:20,713
Shen Shiyan,

855
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:24,073
you're finally not a staid guy.

856
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:29,514
Yu,

857
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:32,153
actually, I didn't tell you
everything yesterday.

858
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:33,034
What is it?

859
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:35,434
You two are

860
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,233
"50 First Dates."

861
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:41,713
"50 First Dates"?

862
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:43,874
Really?

863
00:37:44,153 --> 00:37:45,153
What are you talking about?

864
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,713
I don't understand.

865
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:48,553
You are just not romantic.

866
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,314
Just drink your beer.

867
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,394
She is the girl I told you to cherish.

868
00:37:59,073 --> 00:37:59,713
Wu Yu,

869
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:02,113
I'm sorry about yesterday.

870
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,514
The reason why I went to
the bar yesterday

871
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,153
and why I wanted to see you today
is the same.

872
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,073
It's about something very important.

873
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:20,034
Go on. What is it?

874
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,513
What I am about to tell you

875
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,713
may sound peculiar,

876
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,394
but please believe that

877
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:26,153
Tan Jiao and I are not
talking nonsense.

878
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,754
The murderer of Chen Ningmeng,
Ye Xunyi,

879
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,719
Liu Xiaojiang is the same person.

880
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:35,274
And tomorrow night,

881
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,593
they will continue to kill.

882
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:38,514
I need your help.

883
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:46,713
