I remember when I first met him,

51
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
there was a rainbow

52
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,121
over the horizon of the sea too.

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,361
It seems like

54
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,960
you still can't get it over with.

55
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,681
Pull yourself together.

56
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,960
He's gone for his sister.

57
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,440
It didn't mean
that he doesn't care about you.

58
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:37,161
Probably he'll be back soon

59
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,960
after everything is settled.

60
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,121
It's been half of a year.
Hasn't he got it settled?

61
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,681
Who knows how long will it take?

62
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,840
Besides, he told me

63
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
that we won't meet again

64
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,001
in the future.

I'm not crying.

68
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,840
To be frank, I still don't get the point

69
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,200
of the cruise,

70
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:15,801
our encounter,

71
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,121
my lost memory,

72
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,721
Zhu's case,

73
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:22,801
and Wu Miao's disappearance.

74
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,361
All these that have happened

75
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:27,200
in our lives,

76
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
what's the meaning behind all these?

77
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,880
Since the universe

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,921
has both of you meet again and again,

79
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,280
it means

80
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,481
that there's a strong and
invisible attraction between you.

81
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,840
Have you heard of quantum entanglement?

82
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,640
Even if the pair of entangled electrons

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,840
are transferred to the Sun

84
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,561
and Pluto separately,

85
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,161
they are still correlated.

86
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:01,681
If one of the electrons changes state,

87
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,681
the other will change too.

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,161
I think this explains your relationship
with him.

89
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,760
Hey.

90
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,561
Can you make it understandable?

91
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,361
I don't understand.

92
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,400
What I'm trying to say

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
is that you'll meet him again for sure.

94
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:21,520
Are you sure?

95
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,520
Yes.

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,121
Besides,

97
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,640
I think you can record this feeling
in your new novel

98
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
and publish it in instalments.

99
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,520
You can wait for him
while writing the story.

100
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,840
Perhaps he'll be back
when you finish writing.

101
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:34,960
Don't you think

102
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:36,041
it's romantic?

103
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,361
Right?

104
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,840
It seems

105
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,681
your idea makes some sense.

106
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:51,840
Right.

171
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,081
You order the food.

172
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm sorry to keep you waiting

173
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,001
on our first meeting.

174
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:30,121
I was tied up with work just now.

175
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,321
It's fine.

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,081
Ms. Chui told me that you're a police.

177
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,241
Are you an elementary school teacher?

178
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Staid Shen.

179
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,241
You came here for a blind date?

180
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,680
I don't eat much for dinner.

181
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,640
You can order anything you want.

182
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,841
Are you on a diet?

183
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,441
Do I look like I need that?

184
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,560
What has happened?

185
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:57,961
What are you laughing at?

186
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,241
Nothing.

187
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,961
I realise that you don't talk much.

188
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:03,160
This is good.

189
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,560
I don't like talkative guys.

190
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:07,321
Yes.

191
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,601
I don't talk much.

192
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,241
How about I tell you a dry joke?

193
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:20,481
One day, Mr. Ten Yuan
is kidnapped by someone.

194
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,241
So, the kidnapper...

195
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,201
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

196
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,441
I'd like to apologise to you.

197
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:27,241
Why?

198
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:29,040
To be honest, I have a boyfriend.

199
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,081
My mother looks down on my boyfriend

201
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,201
and disapprove of him.

202
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:34,920
So, she insisted to arrange
a blind date for me.

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,560
Can please tell the middleman

204
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:39,241
that

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,321
I'm not to your liking

206
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,241
and we're not a good match.

207
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:46,800
Hence, I can explain it to my mother.

208
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:48,601
Sure.

209
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,081
I'm really sorry

210
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,160
to put you through grief for nothing.

211
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:52,520
It's fine.

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,920
Xiaoyu.

213
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,961
All dishes are served.

214
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,201
Eat them while it's hot.

215
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,121
Sure.

216
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,160
My phone is out of juice.

217
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,361
Can you please go to the bar counter

218
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:04,601
to get me a power bank?

219
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,760
Thank you.

220
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,361
Sure.

221
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,680
I'll be right back.

222
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,321
Thank you.

223
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:17,721
Mr. Shen.

224
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,001
Are you angry with me?

225
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,560
No.

226
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,201
Didn't you say
that you have a boyfriend?

227
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:26,841
So, it's not appropriate
if I talk to you more.

228
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,601
Let's just get on with our meals.

229
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,520
Don't mind about me.

230
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,481
Alright.

231
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,481
Let's just get on with our meals?

232
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,841
Wonder what's in his mind.

233
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,201
Why can't I drink?

234
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,121
What are you looking at?

235
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Don't be rude to women.

236
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,601
Shut your trap.

237
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,721
Do you want to challenge me?

238
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,400
Don't you?

239
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,280
It hurts.

240
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:03,920
You disturbed public order,

241
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,800
launched an assault

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,880
against women.

243
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,520
You attempted to do this.

244
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Come with me.

245
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,441
Who's you?

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,201
Shen Shiyan, third-level superintendent
of the Municipal Criminal Police Force.

247
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,481
Do you want to challenge him?

248
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:15,361
It's you?

249
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Let's go.

(Qizhu Spicy and Fragrant)

287
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,680
Tan Jiao told me

288
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
that you have many suitors.

289
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,121
Was the man

290
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:29,361
one of your suitors too?

291
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,321
No.

292
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,400
He's my friend.

293
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,001
You're cute.

294
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,441
It's understandable
that you have suitors.

295
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:38,920
Erm...

296
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:40,920
Did you accept him?

297
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,760
No, certainly not.

298
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,241
Didn't you see he's such a coward?

299
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,880
It's out of the question.

300
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,361
By the way,

301
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:51,040
except for this man,

302
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
do you have other suitors?

303
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,880
I think

304
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,321
there are two or three of them.

305
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:57,241
They're not important.

306
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,721
Two or three?

307
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,321
You don't even approve of

308
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,481
any of them.

309
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:05,280
What kind of guy do you like then?

310
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,560
I like a guy who's composed,

311
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,001
rational,

312
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,840
mature

313
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,881
but slightly childish.

314
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:17,921
Childish...

315
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,760
It'd be better

316
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,600
if he's in uniform.

317
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,681
Are you interrogating me?

318
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:32,481
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,921
It's my work habit.

320

I'm so sorry.

321
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,560
What do you mean by

322
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,681
uniform?

323
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,001
Well...

Eat up.

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,560
Hurry up.

327
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,360
Eat the food.

I really like the story
that happened on the cruise.

331
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,641
A pure sweet romance is the best.

332
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:05,040
It's like the story appears
in real life.

333
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,961
You got this, Master.

334
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,961
Silly girl.

335
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,961
Stop imagining your life
is a romance drama.

336
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Thank you, dear.

337
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,040
You'll discover
more loving moments in life

338

The story is well-written.

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,481
I believe in love again.

341
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,080
This couple is meant to be together.

342
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Looking forward to it.

343
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,401
Do you really think it's a sweet story?

344
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,481
Although the story is intriguing,

345
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,560
I can sense something lovelorn about it.

346
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,800
How dare you?

347
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,921
Curse you, lovelorn whelp.

348
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:19,800
Your words are hopeless.

349
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,120
What the heck is this?

350
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:26,161
Heads-up!

351
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,481
I'll update the story tonight.
You'll be overwhelmed

352
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,201
with sweetness tonight.

353
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,641
Stop pretending,
or you'll get hurt more seriously.

354
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Good luck.

355
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:40,721
Sod you.

356
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,641
Who tells you I'm lovelorn?

357
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,040
You must be a hater.

358
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,921
I'm happy.

359
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,721
My life is sweet and nice.

360
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:48,721
I'm faring very well. I...

364
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,320

366

It's 5th August, madam.

368
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,681
What year?

369
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:44,840
Now is

370

the 5th of August, 2021.

371

Madam.

372
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,241
How may I help you?

373
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,441
No, thank you.

You're welcome.

Sorry.

- I...

379
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
Are you alright?

380
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
Miss, are you alright?

381
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm fine.

Sorry.

383
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:31,840
Sure, please be careful.

it means we've just

It's not a dream.

But...

405
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,840
What's going on now?

406
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,241

It means

we're back.

411
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,441
Wu Miao.

412
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,481
Don't worry.

Yu, are you out of your mind?

416
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,120
Let go of me.

417
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,280
What has happened to you, Yu?

418
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,481
Your brother

419
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,840
hasn't seen you for a long time.

420
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,881
So, he's a bit excited.

421
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,721
He hasn't seen me for a long time?

422
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Didn't we just meet?

423
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:24,560
Why are you crying?

424
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,280
Don't scare me.

425
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,280
What's wrong?

426
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,320
Wu Miao, give me your handphone.

427
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:39,080
Why do you need that?

428
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,641
On the 5th of November, 2021,

429
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:41,681
you must stay at home.

430
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,080
Mark this date.

431
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,760
Isn't that my birthday?

432
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,840
I'll hang out with my friends for sure.

433
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,201
No, you can't. You must listen to me.

434
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:50,280
Yu.

435
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,481
What's wrong with you today?

436
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,881
You act weird.

437
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,161
Besides, it's only August now.

438
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:55,560
Yet, you're interrupting my arrangement
in November.

439
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
You're manipulative.

440
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:07,520
Dear.

441
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,241
This is very important.

442
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,881
Why?

443
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,520
You can't tell, right?

444
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:15,120
Let me tell you this.

445
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:17,080
I won't concur with

446
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,201
this unexplained and ridiculous request.

447
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:20,560
Wu Miao.

448
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,040
You must listen to your brother.

449
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:24,840
Who are you?

450
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:27,961
I'm Tan Jiao.

451
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,161
Your brother's friend.

452
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,201
The novel on the table

453
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,520
is written by me.

454
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,681
You're Master Qizhu?

455
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,921
Are you his friend?

456
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,441
This is unbelievable.

457
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,600
Wu Yu, can I ask for her signature?

458
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,241
Master Qizhu.

459
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,681
Could you please sign it for me?

460
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,600
I really like your novel.

461
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:04,441
Sure.

462
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:05,840
But you have to promise me

463
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,520
that you must keep

464
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,840
what he told you in mind.

465
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,641
You mustn't go out
on the 5th of November.

466
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,921
It's very crucial to you.

467
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:15,320
Fine.

468
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,721
If Master Qizhu said so,

469
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,600
I'll act accordingly.

470
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,001
I agree with anything she says.

471
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,080
Unlike someone

472
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,721
who despised the book I read

473
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,040
ten minutes ago.

474
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,241
This book

475
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
is well-written.

476
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,401
Don't worry.

477
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:54,921
Qu Miao has kept that in mind

478
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,201
and she has promised me that.

479
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,560
Thank you.

480
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:00,120
Thanks.

481
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:02,320
Even though

482
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,481
she promised you,

483
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,961
she won't take it seriously.

484
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,800
Please help me

485
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
to take care of her.

486
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,600
Don't worry.

487
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,681
I'm good at interacting with my readers.

488
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,800
By the way,

489
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,001
didn't you

490
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:21,641
go to another city?

491
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,520
I planned to leave for it,

492
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,241
but something happened.

493
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:28,120
What's it?

494
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:45,760
Miss Zhu.

495
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,641
I have something to inform you of.

496
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,320
I was straightening things up
a few days ago.

497
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,961
I discovered this.

498
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:58,280
Regarding the cruise,

499
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,600
I couldn't recall anything of it.

500
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:02,120
But, Miss Tan is in this photo.

501
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,241
I think I should show it to you

502
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,080
perhaps it might be helpful to you.

503
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,881
What's wrong with the photo?

504
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:14,961
In this photo,

505
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,721
except for you, Yan Yuan,

506
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,881
and Zhu Jirui,

507
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,961
everyone in the photo is dead.

508
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,120
Are all of them dead?

00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:24,921
How could it be possible?

510
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:26,040
Miao,

511
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,560
Professor Chen and his family,

512
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:31,560
and a little boy named Zhu Yutong

513
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:33,360
died in accidents within a year

514
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:35,560
after disembarking.

515
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,120
Since we've come back to the cruise,

516
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,681
we have the chance to change everything.

517
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:48,641
Whether it works or not,

518
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,360
we must give it a shot.

519
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,040
Oh, right.

520
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,681
I ran into Yan Yuan on my way here.

521
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,481
I remember that Zhu Jirui said

522
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,520
Yan Yuan and her met

523
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,201
the next day the cruise departed.

524
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:05,760
It's tomorrow.

525
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,201
Do you mean

526
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,641
we're going to stop them from meeting?

527
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,201
Yan Yuan wouldn't get access
to the Zhu's family

528
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,560
and the tragedy can be avoided

529
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:17,161
only if they didn't meet.

530
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:18,560
That's right.

531
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:19,520
If that's the case,

532
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,800
we'll meet up here first thing
in the morning.

533
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,800
We must figure out a plan

534
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,201
to stop them from the meeting.

535
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,560
What's wrong?

536
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:54,040
Do you

537
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,560
have anything to tell me?

538
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,120
Not for now.

Anything's wrong?

540
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,320
No.

541
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:10,481
Take an early rest then.

542
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:11,560
We'll meet here tomorrow.

What's wrong with you, Wu Yu?

612
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,361
There's a special shop over there.
