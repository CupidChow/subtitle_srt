00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:51,084
We're back on the cruise again.

20
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:54,603
Why are we back to this point in time?

21
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:55,364
By just a second later,

22
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,084
we'd have known
the whereabouts of Su Wan.

23
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:14,044
It's 23:26 now.

24
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:16,443
Therefore,

25
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,883
it just lapse a minute

26
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,163
from the time we were in the cruise.

27
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:22,843
But, within this minute,

28
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:24,883
we stayed for two weeks

29
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:25,883
in another universe.

30
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,723
What's the pattern?

31
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,443
Pattern.

32
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:32,443
Let me think about it.

33
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:36,324
I went on board

34
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:37,563
on August 5, 2021.

35
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,644
Not long after I met you,

36
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,003
time travel began

37
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:43,244
and we came to

38
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,003
September 4, 2022.

39
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:48,563
At that time,

40
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:52,324
we met Yan Yuan.

41
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:56,364
Next, on September 18,

42
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:59,364
we were back on the cruise again.

43
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:03,524
However,

44
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,484
we only stayed one day on the cruise.

45
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:09,084
Strangely, the next time travel

46
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,204
landed on August 19th,

47
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,364
2022

48
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,204
where met Chen Ruying there.

49
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,004
Now,

50
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:20,163
we're back on the cruise once again.

51
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,084
Today is September 2nd.

52
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:26,644
Hence, time doesn't move forward,

53
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:27,603
but reverses.

54
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,283
4th to 18th.

55
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:31,564
19th to 2nd.

56
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:32,964
That's to say,

57
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:34,684
the cycle of each time travel
is fifteen days.

58
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:36,324
In other words, time travel

59
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:37,644
works in a specific pattern.

60
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:40,564
So, we'll have to stay for
fifteen days full in the different zone

61
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:42,004
after we left the cruise.

62
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:43,684
Do you realise

63
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,884
that we'll continue what we were doing

64
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,444
when we left the cruise?

65
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,243
We were away fifteen days,

66
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:50,884
yet it was only a moment

67
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:52,723
on the cruise.

68
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:57,843
I wonder when the time travel

69
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,923
will stop.

70
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:03,684
Still, what we did on the cruise

71
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:04,923
last time

72
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,004
really brought Chen Ruying
back to life.

73
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:09,444
Therefore,

74
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,524
we really can

75
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,084
prevent tragedy from happening.

76
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:14,684
Yes, we can.

77
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:17,283
But before this,

78
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,124
there's something important.

79
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:20,644
What's it?

80
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,243
Remember my phone number.

81
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,524
By doing so,

82
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,204
you can find me in any universe

83
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:28,723
and we'll meet again.

84
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:32,043
Well.

85
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:34,803
What about mine?

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,350
♪Find you, find you♪

87
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,530
♪I won't let every second

88
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,100
♪Escapes me♪

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,410
♪No matter♪

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,204
♪Which universe you're in♪

91
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,084
I didn't expect

92
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,684
to taste such delicious ice cream
on the cruise.

93
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,403
My brother doesn't let me
eat ice cream.

94
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:15,564
Which flavour do you like?

95
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,243
I like yam flavour.

96
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,923
Really? I like that too.

97
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,124
- Seriously?
- Yes.

98
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:22,204
We have the same taste.

99
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:24,764
Wu Yu.

100
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:28,564
Well,

101
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,764
I'm on my way back to the room.

102
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,043
He bought this ice cream.

103
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,363
I'm just holding it for him.

104
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,564
I didn't eat it.

105
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:42,564
Yes, I bought this.

106
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:47,843
Go back and rest early.

107
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:50,644
We're off then.

108
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:51,803
Faster.

109
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:53,204
Good night.

110
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:53,884
Good night.

111
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:57,684
Thank you.

112
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:58,324
Bye-bye.

113
00:06:58,564 --> 00:06:59,124
Bye-bye.

114
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:03,483
It's great

115
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:04,764
seeing them

116
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:06,243
have fun together.

117
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:14,964
Although Ying didn't die last time,

118
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:17,923
however, Zhu Yutong
still killed himself.

119
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:22,043
Do you mean

120
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:24,483
we're going to change his destiny too?

121
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:27,403
By the way,

122
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:29,124
since we suspect

123
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:31,043
Su Wan is behind this,

124
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,524
will you remind Mrs Chen?

125
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:35,803
But we don't have evidence now.

126
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:38,084
Don't worry.

127
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:39,483
I'll remind her.

128
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:43,124
You're tired, right?

129
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,004
Rest early.

130
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:48,124
You too.

131
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:49,964
Sure.

132
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,324
Good night.

133
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:20,723
Professor.

134
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,363
Ying was being mischievous just now

135
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,324
and caused you trouble.

136
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,843
I'll ask her to apologise to you
first thing in the morning.

137
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:34,924
Professor.

138
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:37,084
Actually, I called you here

139
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,883
not because of Ying.

140
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:40,924
What's it then?

141
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,044
Just now,

142
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:44,723
I went back in time again.

143
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:46,523
I've been to next year for fifteen days.

144
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:47,763
Fifteen days?

145
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:51,044
We just separated for a moment.

146
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:53,643
So,

147
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:57,084
we still...

148
00:08:58,324 --> 00:08:59,483
But, Ying was alive.

149
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,804
As long as she's alive.

150
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:05,164
Besides, I believe

151
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:08,044
that the future can be changed.

152
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:12,763
Professor.

153
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,164
May I know

154
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,284
if Su Wan came with you too?

155
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,324
It's a family trip.

156
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:21,603
Why would he follow us here?

157
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:23,603
I suspect the arson at the wedding
has something to do with him.

158
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:24,964
I'll look into it more carefully

159
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,324
after I leave here.

160
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:31,603
Professor.

161
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:32,723
It's late now.

162
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:33,924
Please rest early.

163
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:36,523
Wu Yu.

164
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:39,444
I'd like to ask you for a favour.

165
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:41,404
Professor,

166
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:42,523
please don't be so courteous.

167
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,444
You're like my father.

168
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:46,003
Just say it.

169
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:53,284
No matter what's going to happen,

170
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,084
please take care of Ying.

171
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:12,483
Wu Yu.

172
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:13,883
Professor.

173
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,444
I have something to talk to you.

174
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:20,723
Please go ahead.

175
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,123
I'll wait for you

176
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,044
over there.

177
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:26,763
Let's find a place.

178
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,643
Yesterday night,

179
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,123
I asked you to look after Ying.

180
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:35,643
Because I know

181
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,643
I'll be relieved

182
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:39,643
only by handing her over to you.

183
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:43,204
As your mentor,

184
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,164
I have a presumptuous request.

185
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:46,763
Professor.

186
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:47,404
Wu Yu.

187
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:49,603
To be honest, I know

188
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,164
Ying likes you.

189
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:54,883
If you have feelings for her too,

190
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,084
I hope both of you can get married.

191
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:00,843
Taking Ying as part of your family.

192
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,723
If I'm destined to die,

193
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,123
my last wish would be

194
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:12,123
to have someone I trust
to take care of her.

195
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:14,084
If so, I'm relieved.

196
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:15,763
Wu Yu.

197
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,643
Can you do this?

198
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:28,843
It's occupied?

199
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:30,164
Miss.

200
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:33,243
Please sit.

201
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:35,883
There are many ways to approach me.

202
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:37,603
But, your way

203
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:39,284
is just lame.

204
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:43,723
I didn't mean to approach you.

205
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,444
We have a great band playing tonight.

206
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:53,883
If you're coming,

207
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:54,723
I'll reserve the first row for you.

208
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:55,444
Alright?

209
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:56,723
It's you.

210
00:11:59,003 --> 00:11:59,883
I know it.

211
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:01,243
No one will forget me

212
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:02,444
after hearing my singing.

213
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,603
How come you're on this cruise too?

214
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:06,363
What do you mean?

215
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:07,804
I've been working on the cruise.

216
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:09,523
Didn't you hear my singing

217
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,603
in the bar here?

218
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,243
Anyway.

219
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,284
You better grab the chance

220
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,243
to cherish my voice while you can.

221
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:17,603
Soon,

222
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:20,164
I'll be a famous singer
and publish my albums.

223
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:21,763
You'll have to buy tickets

224
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:22,924
to see me then.

225
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:27,883
The entertainment industry

226
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,483
isn't as simple as you think.

227
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,684
Anyway,

228
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,924
you better be prepared
for a long-haul fight.

229
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:35,084
I'm off then.

230
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:35,924
Hold on.

231
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:42,123
Did we meet before?

232
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,564
Where are you from?

233
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:45,003
Dali

234
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:47,044
or Jinghai?

235
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:49,243
Dali.

236
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,123
Did you stay nearby the main road

237
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,843
around Dali's hilly area
when you were young?

238
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,483
How did you know that?

239
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:03,964
Little Cloddish.

240
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:06,123
It's you, Little Cloddish.

241
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:07,444
I...you...

242
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:09,123
It's me, King Braggart.

243
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:09,883
Do you forget me?

244
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:11,603
When we were small, I tricked you

245
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,483
that you could become a flower fairy
by eating five popsicles

246
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,044
And you were then scolded
by your mother.

247
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,643
King Braggart?

248
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:18,523
You're King Braggart?

249
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:19,444
Blimey.

250
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,123
You're so slim now.

251
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:21,964
Oh my.

252
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:22,804
You grew taller now.

253
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:23,804
So much taller than before.

254
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,883
Of course, it's been years.

255
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:27,964
Why do you become a singer now?

256
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:30,123
Professor.

257
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,404
After my parents passed away,

258
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,204
it was you who have been taking care
of me and Miao.

259
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:40,243
So, I'll never turn down your requests.

260
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,603
However, regarding this request,

261
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:46,363
I can't do it.

262
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,003
But I'll protect you with all my might.

263
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,723
Not only Ying

264
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,603
but also you and your wife.

265
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,723
I'll definitely bring you back to life.

266
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:02,723
Mrs Chen.

267
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,084
Ying.

268
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:05,603
Why didn't you take some food?

269
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,324
You can have mine.

270
00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:11,444
No, thanks.

271
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,404
Wu Yu.

272
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,643
Drink orange juice.

273
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:18,883
Right.

274
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:21,404
Professor, Mrs Chen,

275
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,044
Ying.

276
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,843
Please excuse me.

277
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:24,483
Sure.

278
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:25,924
Off you go.

279
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,243
You even cried

280
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:31,284
when I moved away. Do you remember that?

281
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,164
- Tan Jiao.
- Well, I...

282
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:33,643
Wu Yu.

283
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:35,164
You've finished talking?

284
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,804
Don't be worried.

285
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:40,603
I'm fine.

286
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,324
Do you know who I met?

287
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:44,404
He was my neighbour when I was little.

288
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,084
He's Zhou Wei.

289
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:47,243
I'm Wu Yu.

290
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,324
Hello.

291
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:49,603
I'm Tan Jiao's childhood friend.

292
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:50,363
My name is Zhou Wei.

293
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:00,603
Little Cloddish.

294
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:01,523
Shut up.

295
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:03,164
Don't call me that.

296
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:03,804
Do you hear me?

297
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:04,643
Well.

298
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:05,523
Beauty Tan.

299
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,404
I invite you to listen to my singing
at the bar tonight.

300
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:09,123
Tonight?

301
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:10,684
Tonight?

302
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,804
We've been knowing each other
for twenty years.

303
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:17,243
Why did you ask for his permission?

304
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,444
See you at 7 p.m. tonight.

305
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:20,243
I'll wait for you.

306
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:29,003
See you, King Braggart.

307
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,044
What a coincidence.

308
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:36,924
The stranger we'll meet

309
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:38,603
half a year later

310
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,564
is my neighbour when I was little.

311
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:41,763
Wu Yu.

312
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,044
Do we need

313
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,363
to ask Zhou Wei about the cruise...

314
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,044
No need.

315
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,003
Well, I mean

316
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,324
he's just a lounge singer.

317
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,843
He has nothing to do with our target.

318
00:15:57,843 --> 00:15:59,123
We won't get any useful messages
from him.

319
00:15:59,123 --> 00:15:59,723
Am I right?

320
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:03,003
Yes.

321
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,243
I can't believe

322
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,883
that he has become a singer now.

323
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,003
He used to sing badly when he was young.

324
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:13,123
Besides, he was a fat boy.

325
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:14,523
But, he's slim now.

326
00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:16,843
So,

327
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:19,684
are you going to the bar tonight?

328
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:21,843
I'm okay with that.

329
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:23,284
I will if you go too.

330
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,284
I'm going.

331
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,243
Let's go together then.

332
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:43,804
Miao.

333
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:45,084
You were scared, right?

334
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:47,763
What are you shooting?

335
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:49,564
Back then,

336
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:52,084
I wanted to ask for your photo,

337
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:53,883
but I daren't.

338
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,404
Now,

339
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:56,643
I got it.

340
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,684
This is ugly.

341
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,523
Delete it.

342
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:01,324
Delete it. I looked ugly.

343
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:01,763
Delete...

344
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:28,444
Is there anything on my face?

345
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,124
I'm just thinking

346
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,043
that you're beautiful when you smile.

347
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:40,404
Can I keep

348
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,204
this picture?

349
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:44,204
Sure.

350
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,003
Really?

351
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:46,644
Yes.

352
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:56,523
Do you have anything to tell me?

353
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,283
I can't hesitate like Wu Yu.

354
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:09,323
Youngsters must be brave.

355
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,323
I like you.

356
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,243
You like me too, right?

357
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:24,523
I said, I like you.

358
00:18:27,444 --> 00:18:28,803
Don't evade my question.

359
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:29,884
Do you like me?

360
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:31,644
But

361
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:35,043
I haven't liked someone in a long time.

362
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:38,164
It's fine.

363
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,763
I haven't fallen for someone before.

364
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:43,803
I

365
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:46,604
I have many flaws.

366
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:52,083
Stop hesitating.

367
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:56,763
Miao!

368
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:02,964
I like you.

369
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:08,164

Run.

441
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,604
It was so awkward.

442
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,243
I was going to cringe

443
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,164
if I still stay here.

00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:44,043
purposely say that to him?

It's Chen Ruying.

Enough about Su Wan.

452
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:52,563
I've had enough of him.

453
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:54,644
He has already called you three times.

454
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:57,043
Calling back is common decency.

455
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:59,204
But I hate to listen to him.

456
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,404
I don't like him either.

457
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:02,124
I wish he could stay out
of my sight for good.

458
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:03,164
I warn you,

459
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:04,763
you better not act tough.

460
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,763
You always tell me

461
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:07,964
that Su Wan is considerate.

462
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,124
There are many considerate men
out there too.

463
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,124
Why don't you ask me to marry them too?

464
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:12,924
You!

465
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:14,164
Mum.

466
00:24:14,283 --> 00:24:16,043
I know what you're plotting.

467
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:17,844
You want Su Wan
to take over your business

468
00:24:17,844 --> 00:24:19,404
after marrying me.

469
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:20,924
But mum,

470
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:23,283
I only marry someone I love.

471
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:25,124
You're drunk.

472
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:25,803
Go back with me.

473
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:28,884
I didn't drink at all.

474
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,364
Faster.

475
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,444
Her mother is aggressive.

476
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:34,884
Judging her attitude,

477
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,483
what should we do to remind her?

478
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:44,043
Why do I think

479
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,644
that things have become
more complicated?

480
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,083
Whenever we're going

481
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,364
to reach the truth,

482
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,924
more mysteries turn up.

483
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:55,924
What are those secrets

484
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:59,003
hiding in this cruise?

485
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,323
No matter what,

486
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:16,563
I'll protect you and Miao.

487
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:20,124
I want to protect Miao with you.

488
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:21,404
Sure.

489
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:27,924
The night view is beautiful.

490
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:29,884
Let's enjoy it.

491
00:25:31,444 --> 00:25:32,043
Sure.

492
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,003
Can I open my eyes now?

493
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:46,684
Yes.

494
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,483
The night sky in the middle of the ocean
is so beautiful.

495
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,243
It's amazing.

496
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:02,844
Wu Yu.

497
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:04,523
What's that?

498
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:06,043
That one.

499
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,204
It's a moonbow.

500
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,083
Light from the moon is weaker
than sunlight.

501
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,684
Hence, a moonbow is rare to be seen.

502
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,404
We're lucky, aren't we?

503
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:30,364
Do you see

504
00:26:30,364 --> 00:26:31,723
the three stars
which outshine the others?

505
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:33,483
That's Altair,

506
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:34,964
Vega,

507
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:37,204
and Deneb.

508
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:39,283
The three stars

509
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:41,563
form the famous Summer Triangle
in the northern celestial hemisphere.

510
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,444
While Altair and Vega

511
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:45,404
are known as

512
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,003
the Cowherd Star and
the Weaver Maid Star.

513
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:49,763
The Cowherd Star.

514
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,444
The Weaver Maid Star.

515
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,523
They're far apart.

516
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:58,964
14.57 light-years apart.

517
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:02,844
They persist to meet up once annual

518
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,523
despite the far distance.

519
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:05,884
Probably

520
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:09,124
they love each other very much.

521
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:11,243
According to the life span of stars,

522
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:13,483
they meet up once every year

523
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:16,563
equals to humans meeting up once
within three seconds.

524
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,164
They love so deeply with each other

525
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,323
till

526
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:23,483
they can't bear to leave each other
even for three seconds.

527
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,924
What if they get lost in the galaxy

528
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:29,083
because they're far away
from each other?

529
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,323
They wouldn't get lost.

530
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:32,604
Why?

531
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:38,483
The universe came into being
after the Big Bang.

532
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,844
The heavy atoms that make up our bodies

533
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:43,043
are the stardust from Big Bang.

534
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:45,964
If the heavy atoms of the two persons

535
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,924
originate from stardusts
of the same planet,

536
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:51,604
they'll be attracted to each other.

537
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:53,844
Although the wheel of time turns,

538
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:56,754
they don't lose
their bearings to each other.

539
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:02,204
Previously, I refrained myself
from getting closer to you

540
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,924
because I'm not qualified
to protect you.

541
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:07,003
But, I'm wrong.

542
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:10,323
The girl I love is strong and composed.

543
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:13,323
She's the soulmate
who fights together with me.
