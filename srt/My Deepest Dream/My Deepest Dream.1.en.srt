00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,231
that I don't dare to take another dive?

169
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,790
I just don't want you
to miss out on the beautiful scenery.

170
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,871
Don't worry.

171
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,590
I love adventures.

172
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:28,830
Although I don't know
what will happen on the way,

173
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,430
I guess

174
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,031
this is a way for me to have
beautiful accidental encounters.

175
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,830
What's wrong with my car?

176
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,820
(Garage)

177
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,710
Remember to put some lubricant
when you change the tires.

178
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,351
Did you finish sorting them out?

179
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:15,430
These are tires.

180
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,430
What did I tell you yesterday?

181
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,231
They sent it here yesterday.

182
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,351
I couldn't get to it in time.

183
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,151
I won't listen to your excuses.

184
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,031
Lady!

185
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:25,991
What's wrong with your car?

186
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,351
My tires are punctured.

187
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,910
Check it and see if it's serious.

188
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:30,830
Alright.

189
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:31,590
I'll ask

190
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,310
our top mechanic
to check it out for you.

191
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,830
Thanks.

192
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,351
Yu!

193
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,631
Come and take a look.

194
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,271
It's pouring out there.

195
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:24,550
Why don't we make the run?

196
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:26,111
The rain will stop soon.

197
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,351
Cumulonimbus like this,
which is formed by

198
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,471
the convergence of hot and cold air

199
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:30,511
will pass soon.

200
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,430
Once the cloud passes,
the rain will stop.

201
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:33,991
That's why we call it a passing shower.

202
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:42,790
You must be a prophet!

203
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,871
Look, it's a rainbow.

204
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,751
It's gorgeous.

205
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:54,670
This is a beautiful accidental
encounter indeed.

206
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:59,111
First, you're a diver.
Now, you're a prophet.

207
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:00,991
What exactly do you do for a living?

208
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:01,751
I'm a PhD student

209
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:02,590
in Astrophysics.

210
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:05,751
What about you?

211
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,070
I...

212
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,351
You can predict the future, right?

213
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:12,511
Why don't you try to predict my job?

214
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,271
Alright, I'll make a prediction then.

215
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,231
I predict that we'll see each other

216
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,910
in the restaurant at 6pm.

217
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:21,631
I'm Wu Yu.

218
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,950
Wu with an Er,

219
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,351
And Yu as in nice to meet you.

220
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,471
I'm Tan Jiao.

221
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,950
Tan with a Yan,

222
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:30,670
Jiao, as in shining moon.

223
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,910
You didn't send your car for maintenance
for a long time.

224
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,871
You don't need to change the tires.

225
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,910
It'll be fine after some fixing.

226
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,271
Will you do it?

227
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,430
Yeah.

228
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,190
I'll get the tools.

229
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,830
(Wasn't he taking his PhD in Jinghai?)

230
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,950
Yu is awesome.

231
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,391
He can fix all kinds of models.

232
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,111
He used to be a top student.

233
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,151
Top student?

234
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,631
Have you ever heard of
the term "passing shower"?

235
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:49,950
Yu,

236
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,151
how long have you been working here?

237
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,151
Less than one month.

238
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,590
Hua,

239
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,271
bring our guest to her seat.

240
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:01,031
Lady,

241
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:01,871
follow me.

242
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,110
(Seems like he doesn't know me.)

243
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:15,630
Lady,

244
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,671
here's some water.

245
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:18,511
Thanks.

246
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,751
We just opened
our workshop not long ago.

247
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:21,870
We're doing a promotion right now.

248
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,150
If you use our prepaid card, we'll give
you a 50% discount for your car wash.

249
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,790
Do you want a prepaid card?

250
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,070
It's quite the bargain.

251
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,271
It's worth it.

252
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,511
You just need to reload 1,000 yuan

253
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,390
for you to designate your own mechanic.

254
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,070
Yu,

255
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,830
I'll leave my car to you in the future.

256
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,911
Here, Miss Tan.

257
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,070
Thanks.

258
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,070
Don't mention it.

259
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:06,471
I'm Tan Jiao.

260
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,231
Tan with a Yan,

Jiao, as in shining moon.

262
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,550
I'm Hua.

263
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:17,711
Why don't you give me your contact?

264
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:18,830
Contacting him will do.

265
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:23,590
Do you have any elder
or younger brothers?

266
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,511
340 yuan.

267
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:28,350
I've deducted it from your card.

268
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:29,671
Sign here.

269
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,500
(Car maintenance ticket)

270
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,511
Did I give Miss Tan

271
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,671
the receipt just now?

272
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,380
(Pengxiang Car Maintenance Prepaid Card)

273
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,070
You did.

274
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:25,271
Don't tell me you two knew each other?

275
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:27,310
Just do your work.

276
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,550
So, this is close to my unit.

277
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:40,550
I'm Wu Yu.

278
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,191
Wu with an Er,

279
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,150
Yu, as in encounter.

280
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:56,550
(Could it be that
he's still angry about that?)

281
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,390
Tell me.

282
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,310
Did you have an affair outside?

283
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:09,711
I thought you weren't going?

284
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,150
And,

285
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:13,031
if I must say, you're too much
of a shut-in.

286
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:14,191
You should have fun when you're outside.

287
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:15,911
Stop reading those stupid novels.

288
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:18,310
This is a novel written by
Master Qizhu, you know?

289
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,870
It's not stupid.

290
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,191
You mean this?

291
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,191
May Time Flies?

292
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,550
She's just a Marcel Proust knockoff.

293
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,031
Listen,

294
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,390
this novel is amazing.

295
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,991
You'll surely like it if you read it.

296
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,550
Here.

297
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,150
No thanks.

298
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:34,951
It doesn't feel interesting
just by the name itself.

299
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,070
And, look.

300
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,471
I guess everyone can
write a novel nowadays.

301
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,471
It's no wonder
you didn't improve at all.

302
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,671
How could you improve
when this was the only thing you read?

303
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:41,630
That's not it.

304
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,751
Master Qizhu wrote a great novel.

305
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,390
What kind of stupid view was that?

306
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,271
Just take a look.

307
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:45,911
Just ten minutes.

308
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,991
Don't try to act coy here.

309
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,150
I have something else to do later.

310
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:48,790
You should head back first.

311
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:03,471
Don't let him pass!

312
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:08,751
Catch!

313
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:15,511
I was just...

314
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,711
I was just passing by.

315
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,911
I saw you guys playing basketball

316
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,231
when I was passing by.

317
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,031
That's why I came to take a look.

318
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,671
You...

319
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,790
Where are you going?

320
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:40,830
Don't touch it with your bare hands.

321
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:48,431
It hurts.

322
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:53,590
Yu.

323
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,991
I truly feel

324
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:58,951
that you're very similar
to a person I know.

325
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,590
My life was in danger
when I went diving before.

326
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,870
He was the one who saved me.

327
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:14,191
Don't be in contact with water lately.

328
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:17,671
Say,

329
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:19,991
how could there be two people
who look the same?

330
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:24,031
Do you think this is
The Prince and the Pauper?

331
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,191
Or is this The Double Life of Veronique?

332
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,790
