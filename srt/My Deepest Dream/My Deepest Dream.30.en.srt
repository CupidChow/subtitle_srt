Just keep moving forward.

You'll be back to reality
once you go through it.

I got it. Don't worry.

They all went through it
one by one, didn't they?

38
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,747
I'll just do as they did.

00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:51,108
What do you want to do

after you get back?

41
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:55,747
I'll realize my dreams
for my future, of course.

Don't you forget that

you still owe me a ring.

00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:12,987
I repaired this watch?

Yes.

restarted the gears of destiny.

50
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,788
And we have experienced
many moments together.

51

I want to remember every single moment.

52
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,228

every moment we spent together.

54
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:34,987
Not just now,

55
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,427
there will be countless,

56

countless moments in the future.

every time I travel through time.

66
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,547
And this time, I saw that

67
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:55,387
you pushed me through this.

68
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,947
You've been trying to keep it from me,

69
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:01,708
but I already knew

70
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,148
what would happen since the beginning.

71
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,067
You've planned to stay behind all along?

72
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,228
No.

73

All this time,

74
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:15,507
we've been traveling
through time tunnel.

(A year later)

Mercury's perihelion produces
a gravitational redshift.

00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:13,747
And gravitational redshift

131
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,787
produces a bending of
the gravitational field,

132
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,267
which will cause time reversal

133

and spatial instability.

that wave seems to have changed.

It's okay,

it's just the wrong interface.

Sorry about that, sir.

142
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:46,667
It's okay. You may return to your seat.

Guys,

do you know

145
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,907
what the most important thing
about an experiment is?

146
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,387
Proper operation of lab equipment.

147
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:00,548
What else?

148
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:03,267
Record the data well.

149
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:04,987
All correct,

150
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,387
but not accurate.

151
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:09,907
The most important thing
is not being afraid to make mistakes,

152
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:11,907
because each mistake

153
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:14,108
examines the truth behind time.

154
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:16,588
Only by seizing every possibility

155
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,267
can we create a bright future.

156
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:26,428
That's all for today's lesson.

157
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:27,428

How was it?

160
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,787
How was

161
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:40,907
your first lecture?

162
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:42,267

But I finally understand

164
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,267
why you were always tired after class.

165
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:49,548
That's why you have to grow up quickly

166
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:50,907
and take over my classes sooner.

167

Sir,

171
00:11:58,228 --> 00:11:59,147
I got plans.

172
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:00,627
Plans?

173
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,188
Ying asked me to dinner.

174
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:05,708
Nice.

175
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:08,228
So which stage are you on?

176
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:09,867
Sir...

Alright, alright.

It's between you young people,

179

I won't ask then.

180

What time are you meeting?

181

6:30 p.m..

182
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:24,387
Hurry up then, go now.

183
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,907
If you're late,

184
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,108
Ying will be upset again.

185
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:45,507
Have you been waiting long?

186
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:46,627
I just got here.

187
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,708
You're such a gentleman, Yu.

188
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:53,027
By the way,

189
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:54,188
I bought you a present

190
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,188
to congratulate you
on becoming a lecturer.

191
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:57,348
Remember to collect the delivery.

192
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,267
Thank you.

193
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,428
You said you have
something important to tell me.

194
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:01,147
What is it?

195
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,428
The University of Leipzig has awarded me

196
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,027
a full scholarship to study topology.

197
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,228
I'm going abroad soon.

198
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:07,548
You're going to study abroad?

199
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:10,548
Congratulations.

200
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:11,948
You can study the Klein bottle now.

201
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,188
But how come Mr. Chen
didn't mention it to me?

202
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:17,387
I decided it secretly.

203
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:18,987
You're the first person I told.

204
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:21,428
I think I should pursue

205
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:22,747
things I like to do.

206
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,548
What do you think?

207
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:25,828
I support you.

208
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:27,027
I knew it.

209
00:13:27,468 --> 00:13:30,667
The guy I liked before
would definitely support me.

210
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:35,468
In the past,

211
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,667
I really liked you.

212
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,267
But then I found out that

213
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,267
there seems

214
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,308
to be someone in your heart.

215
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:47,787
You never said it,

216
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,468
but I can feel that

217
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:51,348
you care about her very much.

218
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,108

You have to believe girls' intuition.

224

Anyway,

Now wish me the best
for my upcoming study in Germany.

I wish you the best.

Congratulations on
officially becoming a wage earner.
