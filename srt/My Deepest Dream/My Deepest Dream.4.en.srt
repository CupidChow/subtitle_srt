about one particular child.

He was having some cake.

Why did the kidnapper do that?

No idea.

One more thing.

457

The hideout

458
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,400
is so remote and hidden.

459
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,361
How did you chance upon it, Miss Tan?

460

We were having an excursion

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,960
Exactly.

463
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,841

464
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:00,240

but I can't remember.

482
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,761
You lost one year of memory.

483

It's normal to feel that way.

484
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,680
Maybe this is a sign that your memory
is coming back.

485

Where have I met her before?

486

What's going on?

499
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,680
The police just called

500
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:59,240
and asked if the kidnapper contacted us.

501

Did he?

502
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:06,440
So why did the police ask us
that question?

503
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,321
Do you not get it?

504
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,361
That means the kidnapper
reached out to others.

505
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,720
The kidnapper didn't contact us.

506

Does that mean Zihan...

Anything new from her?

513
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,121
She told me

514
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,561
when she was there, Zihan was safe.

515
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:34,841
She didn't tell me anything else.

516
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,081
That's all?

517
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,081
Nothing else?

518
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:39,561
Isn't that a waste of time?

519
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,281
I don't even know

520
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,001
if Han is dead or alive.

521
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,440
Zihan is fine.

522
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,680
I mean

523
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,081
the kidnapper won't probably target
Zihan

524
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:00,321
so he should be fine.

525
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
I was so scared just now.

526
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,001
Why did the birds target me?

527
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:32,801
Thank god you're there.

528
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:34,761
Thank you.

529
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,841
Why were you there, by the way?

530
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:39,200
I was passing by.

531
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,001
You were injured previously.

532
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
You should rest up.

533
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,281
I'm fine.

534
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,521
I...

535
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,081
I'll head back then.

536
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,281
Bye.

537
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,440
Ouch.

538
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
What happened?

539
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,321
Why are you here?

540
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,081
I need to live here.

541
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,001
What?

542
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:14,960
I want to live with you.
