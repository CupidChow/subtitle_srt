They look like stars.

63
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:30,907
The universe is so vast

64
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:33,308
that we can calculate distance
using light years.

65
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,507
The stars we see now

66

were formed many years ago.

67
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:42,308
But no matter how many
light years have passed,

68
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,268
they will eventually cross the universe

69
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:45,907
and merge into the Milky Way.

86

His health has been deteriorating.

00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,107
We found solid evidence

171
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,988
that you planned and prepared

172
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,148
to attack four women.

173
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:26,908
Sir,

174
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,468
I've told you many times.

175
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,148
I was being controlled.

176
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:31,907
Tan Jiao is my friend.

177
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:33,587
We've known each other
since we were in kindergarten.

178
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:34,787
I kidnapped her?

179
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,148
Have I gone mad?

180
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:37,748
Are you saying you were coerced?

181
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:39,187
Not coerced.

182
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:41,548
It wasn't like someone was holding
a knife to my neck.

183
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:42,268
Not that kind.

184
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:45,348
My mind was being controlled.

185
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:46,307
You get it?

186
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,628
It is me that you see,

187
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,348
but in here,

188
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:52,628
it's someone else.

189
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:54,388
Are you saying you were hypnotized?

190
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:56,907
Not hypnotized.

191
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,108
I didn't lose my mind and consciousness,

192
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,748
I just lost the control of my body.

193
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,028
I didn't want to do those things.

194
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:07,388
It was that person who wanted to
do it, but he had me do it for him.

195
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,187
First love?

196
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,748
Cyberbullying?

197
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,587
Those had absolutely nothing
to do with me.

198
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,587
You guys can check it
if you don't trust me.

199
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,467
I was on tour in 2019.

200
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:17,987
I wasn't even in Jinghai.

201
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:18,947
Listen carefully,

202
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:21,268
stop giving us nonsense.

203
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:24,707
Fine.

204
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:26,187
If it wasn't you,

205
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:27,587
who was it then?

206
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:29,227
How did you meet?

207
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:30,707
And how did he control you?

208
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:31,707
I don't know.

209
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,187
I really don't know.

210
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:36,628
It probably...

211
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:40,508
It probably happened before.

212
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,748
He tampered with my memory.

213
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,067
But then I came to my senses.

214
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:48,067
I was also puzzled by what I was doing.

215
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:54,667
Hold on.

216
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,827
I think I remember something.

217
00:10:58,508 --> 00:10:59,907
What is it? Tell us.

218
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,868
He won't stop.

219
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,228
You can't catch him.

220
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,587
Those who deserve to die

221
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,707
won't be able to get away.

222
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:24,427
Pen!

223
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:26,707
Paper!

224
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:28,388
Now!

225
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:29,187
Uncuff him.

226
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,268
The patient's heart rate is high.

227
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:13,348
Please leave the ward first.

228
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,268
What did he write?

229
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:23,427
Take a look at it.

230
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:30,228
How is it?

231
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:31,827
Can you understand it?

232
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,308
We conducted

233
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:42,108
a thorough forensic investigation
at Zhou Wei's house

234
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,148
and the place of Tan Jiao's kidnapping.

235
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:47,028
We found no sign
that anyone else had been there.

236
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,707
There were no fingerprints, hairs,

237
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,067
or other physical evidence.

238
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,307
Could Zhou Wei be telling the truth?

239
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,148
He was under some kind of mind control.

240
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,748
A normal person
was made to commit crime,

241
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,388
while the real culprit
remains hidden in the shadows

242
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:04,868
and gets away with it.

243
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,108
The mind control that he said...

244
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:10,187
Is it even possible?

245
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:12,587
Mind control,
as it is known in psychology,

246
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,428
will only change and influence

247
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:16,347
one's judgment of

248
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,868
oneself or the outside world,

249
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,068
but not to the extent that
being controlled

250
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,587
like a puppet on a string,
as what he described.

251
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,227
But...

252
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,628
Since he said there is another person,

253
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,748
we should follow this lead
and investigate it.

254
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,707
About the unidentified object
extracted from his stomach,

255
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:30,907
have you tested it?

256
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,268
It is something similar to a stone.

257
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:34,307
The expert said

258
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:36,347
it contains a large amount
of radioactive elements,

259
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:37,028
cesium.

260
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:38,427
This object

261
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,228
has been in his stomach
for quite some time.

262
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:41,867
It has caused

263
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,547
an irreparable damage to his body.

264
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:44,468
Cesium?

265
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:46,388
Can I take a look at it?

266
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:52,737
(Forensic Identification Center)

267
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,348
This is an important exhibit.

268
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,307
Please be careful.

269
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,348
Cesium

270
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,468
is the most metallic
and radioactive element,

271
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,028
which doesn't exist in nature
as a single substance

272
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,788
and is in the form of salt.

273
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,307
It's rarely found
in continents or oceans.

274
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:14,067
The outermost electron
of the cesium atoms

275
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,759
spins around the nucleus

276
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:16,787
at such a constant rate

277
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:19,348
that scientists use its speed

278
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,707
to define the time unit, one second.

279
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:24,508
It is the element that defines time.

280
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:25,987
The expert said

281
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,028
if this thing is close to
a strong magnetic field,

282
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:27,787
it will produce...

283
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,587
In short, unpredictable changes.

284
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:41,507
Human brain wave

285
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,628
is essentially an electromagnetic wave.

286
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:47,067
Could that person have used this stone

287
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:48,667
to control Zhou Wei's mind?

288
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:51,347
This would seem to be
the logical explanation

289
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,108
for Zhou Wei's puzzling behavior.

290
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,187
But is this

291
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:56,907
really possible?

292
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:59,428
Today's science hasn't been able
to manipulate

293
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:00,587
the human brain through
electromagnetic waves,

294
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,947
but theoretically, it's possible.

295
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,028
Could this stone

296
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,787
be brought back from the island?

297
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:13,508
If our assumption is correct,

298
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:18,468
then the person we are up against
will be extremely powerful.

299
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,228
Officer Shen,

300
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,787
it should be stored
with a strong magnetic shielding device.

301
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,427
And don't allow anyone
to hold it for a long time.

302
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,108
Leave it to me.

303
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,195
(Forensic Identification Center)

304
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,748
How did it go? How was it?

305
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:38,908
Zhu.

306
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:39,587
Yu.

307
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,947
It's likely that Zhou Wei
was under mind control.

308
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,187
I wouldn't even dare to use a plot
like this in my science fiction.

309
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,068
But I have faith that

310
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,348
he will catch the bad guy.

311
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:50,228
Right, Staid Shen?

312
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,068
We have arranged for the four girls

313
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:54,948
to be questioned
early tomorrow morning.

314
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,827
See if we can find a clue
to the second person.

315
00:15:58,388 --> 00:15:59,548
It's getting late now.

316
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:00,787
You guys should go back
and get some rest.

317
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:02,827
If there is any update tomorrow,
we'll be in touch.

318
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,067
We'll be leaving first.

319
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:06,788
Bye bye.

320
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:07,228
Bye bye.

321
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:10,787
Xiaoyu,

322
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:12,987
let me take you home.

323
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:13,868
Okay, let's go.

324
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:19,988
What's wrong?

325
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,148
Will this make you more secure?

326
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:32,627
You are not as unromantic as I thought.

327
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:33,707
Of course.

328
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:34,988
Right?

329
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,107
Wu Yu, that brat

330
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:38,227
usually looks pretty quiet.

331
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:40,187
I didn't expect him
to propose so quickly.

332
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:41,948
Do you prefer

333
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:43,947
a more simple proposal

334
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,108
or a more ceremonious one?

335
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:49,468
What?

336
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:51,868
Are you trying to take a shortcut?

337
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:52,868
No, no.

338
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:54,748
Just trying to discuss it with you.

339
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,188
Tell me then,

340
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,268
how do you want to propose?

341
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,667
Well...

342
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:02,667
I...

343
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,787
I could hide the ring

344
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,188
in a piece of cake.

345
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,067
Or hide it

346
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:10,948
in a pile of roses

347
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:12,147
and let her find it by herself.

348
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:16,508
Oh, right.

349
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,628
I can get my guys in
the police force to stand in a line

350
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,747
and sing a love song together.

351
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:21,708
Romantic, right?

352
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:23,827
Will you do something for me?

353
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:24,628
What is it?

354
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,267
When it comes to our proposal,

355
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,148
please don't do anything
ostentatious like this.

356
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:29,228
Keep it simple.

357
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:30,107
Promise me.

358
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:31,867
Our proposal?

359
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:33,587
What?

360
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,027
Was I not the one in your mind

361
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,668
when you talked about proposal just now?

362
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,468
From the moment I met you,

363
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:43,708
there is no one else but you in my mind.

364
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,988
That's more like it.

365
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:49,028
Hold on.

366
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:50,867
Put her down now.

367
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:45,828
-Zhu.
-Wu Yu,

368
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:46,827
is Miao home?

369
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:47,748
Miao?

370
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:49,587
We were supposed
to meet at eight o'clock.

371
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,108
I waited for an hour,
and she didn't come.

372
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,268
She hasn't answered my calls either.

373
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,748
Miao is probably still in bed.

374
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:57,307
I'll wake her up.

375
00:19:58,988 --> 00:19:59,587
Miao?

376
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:01,988
Miao?

377
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,347
Miao?

378
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:12,147
I'm coming in.

379
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:13,708
Miao...

380
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,587
Still not answering?

381
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:36,787
Please pick up.

382
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:38,147
Please pick up.

383
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:41,948
Wu Miao?

384
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:44,428
Wu Miao, is it you?

385
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:46,268
Where are you now?

386
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,028
Wu Yu,

387
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:50,827
he got me.

388
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:52,948
Goodbye.

389
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,268
Hello?

390
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:57,067
Hello?

391
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:23,107
Don't worry.

392
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,347
Miao will be fine.

393
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:26,507
We will

394
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:27,867
catch that culprit.

395
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,067
I have a feeling that

396
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,908
he has changed his target.

397
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,468
But why did he still take Miao away?

398
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:53,107
Could it be that

399
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:55,748
he's also like us?

400
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:58,827
He knows what will happen
to him in the future,

401
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,468
and what he will get.

402
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:06,108
We ruined his plans

403
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:07,787
again and again.

404
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:12,948
He must really hate us now.

405
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,067
Who is there?

406
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:54,268
Wu Yu.

407
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:09,787
(Only we know)

408
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,228
(what each other wants.)

409
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,387
(I will take her away)

410
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,428
(before the last sunset.)

411
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,508
Take this original copy
for identification.

412
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:34,547
Expedite it.

413
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:35,188
Yes, sir.

414
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,988
I think your analysis is right.

415
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,188
The man who took Wu Miao
is not an ordinary criminal.

416
00:23:42,627 --> 00:23:43,307
He has typical

417
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:44,627
antisocial personality traits.

418
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,827
He's supposed to be hiding himself
at times like this.

419
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,467
Why would he risk

420
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:50,948
the exposure of his identity

421
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:52,347
and take Wu Miao away?

422
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:54,428
I think there is
only one reason for this.

423
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:56,827
He wants to use Wu Miao to torment you.

424
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,787
But who is this person?

425
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:02,067
Try to think carefully.

426
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:04,867
Before Wu Miao was taken away,
who did she meet?

427
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:06,148
Who did she contact?

428
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,108
Did anything

429
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:08,468
special happen?

430
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,508
Miao has been staying at home lately.

431
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,988
Other than me and Wu Yu,

432
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:14,987
there is only Zhu Yutong.

433
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,028
Zhu Yutong?

434
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:17,268
Who is he?

435
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:20,107
Zhu Yutong...

436
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,188
He's Miao's boyfriend.

437
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,707
Zhu Yutong is the first person

438
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:32,387
to notice that Miao is missing.

439
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:36,627
But he has no reason to hurt Miao.

440
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:38,547
No reason doesn't mean
he's beyond suspicion.

441
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,747
We can't miss any clues.

442
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:41,867
No matter who he is,

443
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:43,108
as long as he makes moves,

444
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:43,948
he will leave

445
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:45,147
more and more traces.

446
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:47,428
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

447
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,228
This person was like a phantom before,

448
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:52,668
but now,

449
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:53,547
his silhouette

450
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,107
has been revealed little by little.

451
00:24:55,988 --> 00:24:56,867
There is only

452
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,387
a thin veil that
separates us from him now.

453
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:07,708
Relax.

454
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,228
It's just routine questioning.

455
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,107
You and Wu Miao are a couple?

456
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:17,387
Yes.

457
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:20,508
Miao is the best girl I've ever met.

458
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:23,547
I failed to take care of her.

459
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:25,268
Yesterday at 10:30 a.m.,

460
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:26,748
where were you?

461
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:29,508
Miao and I agreed
to meet up at 8:00 a.m..

462
00:25:30,188 --> 00:25:31,227
But I waited for an hour,

463
00:25:31,307 --> 00:25:32,387
and she didn't show up.

464
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:35,268
She didn't answer my calls either.

465
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:37,387
So, I went to her house to find her.

466
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:41,547
That's how I found out
something had happened to her.

467
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:51,227
Was it Wu Miao
who suddenly asked to meet up?

468
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:52,588
Or did you already arrange

469
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:53,948
to meet up before?

470
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:55,307
As far as you know,

471
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,428
did anyone else know that

472
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:57,627
you two were going to meet?

473
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,748
It was Miao who asked to meet up.

474
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:01,468
If someone knew...

475
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:05,587
Officer Shen,

476
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:08,107
are you saying that

477
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:10,627
someone knew Miao was going out

478
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:12,908
and that's why he took her away?

479
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:21,787
I knew it.

480
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,827
I shouldn't have agreed to meet her.

481
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:26,307
This is all my fault.

482
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:32,547
We are still investigating it.

483
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:33,547
Calm down.

484
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:35,508
The more information you can give us,

485
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,547
the more likely it is
that we can find the perpetrator.

486
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:39,028
This is all my fault.

487
00:26:40,428 --> 00:26:41,428
This isn't your fault.

488
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:41,988
By the way,

489
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,587
what were you doing
when you were waiting for Wu Miao?

490
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:45,547
I was reading.

491
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,587
Phantom by Jo Nesbo.

492
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:51,107
Most people

493
00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,867
would take a few seconds to think
before they answer.

494
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:07,228
Officer Shen,

495
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:10,988
I'm the last person Miao contacted.

496
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:14,708
So I understand
that you are suspecting me.

497
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,188
But I really regret it.

498
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:19,147
I am very sad.

499
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,228
You can arrest me,

500
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:22,708
lock me up,

501
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,708
or torture me,

502
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:26,827
whatever you want.

503
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:29,347
Just return Miao to me.

504
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:30,908
You have to get her back.

505
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:32,387
Please.

506
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:39,787
We have no evidence to prove

507
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,587
that you have something to do
with Wu Miao's disappearance.

508
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:43,748
How can we detain you?

509
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:45,067
As I told you,

510
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:47,067
this is just a routine questioning.

511
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:48,468
You may leave now.

512
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:56,668
I will count on you.

513
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:04,748
Zhu Yutong.

514
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,668
If you recall anything useful,
contact us anytime.

515
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:16,827
Thank you.

516
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,948
When he answered that he was reading,

517
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:26,627
he answered too fast.

518
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:29,228
It's like he was waiting for me
to ask him that.

519
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:32,267
I just received a message.

520
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,908
He does have an alibi.

521
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:35,428
He can't be the one who left the letter.

522
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:38,351
(A witness confirmed that Zhu Yutong
was at the bookstore at 10:30.)

523
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:19,468
You're back.

524
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:21,908
How is it?

525
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,147
Any news?

526
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:27,508
What about Zhu Yutong?

527
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:28,587
What did he say?

528
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:30,107
I asked the police.

529
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:31,948
When Miao went missing,

530
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:33,107
he was in the bookstore.

531
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:34,347
He never left.

532
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:37,547
So, that means

533
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:40,708
we can rule out Zhu Yutong.

534
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:45,908
During the time you were out,

535
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:48,948
did the murderer make any other moves?

536
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:50,827
No.

537
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:54,627
That's odd.

538
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:57,827
This isn't like his usual style.

539
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,147
He would either leave us a riddle

540
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:01,748
or make demands.

541
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:06,267
But sending us a letter
without any demand,

542
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,147
and nothing more?

543
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:10,307
This isn't like him.

544
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:44,867
Stop reading it.

545
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:45,988
Let's eat.

546
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:50,827
Come on.

547
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:01,387
Have you

548
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:03,347
figured out a way?

549
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:06,107
No.

550
00:31:09,387 --> 00:31:10,867
Whatever happens next,

551
00:31:11,228 --> 00:31:12,307
it will be a tough battle.

552
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:14,708
So, we need to eat enough
to gain strength.

553
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:17,147
You should finish everything
in your bowl.

554
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,067
I'll go get you a bowl of soup.

555
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,067
Okay.

556
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:06,787
Thank you.

557
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:11,147
Finish your rice,

558
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:14,468
and your soup too.

559
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:17,107
Wu Yu.

560
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:20,307
Will our lives

561
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:22,827
be normal and peaceful again?

562
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:24,067
It will.

563
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:26,468
I promise you that, Tan Jiao.

564
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,107
But the premise is that

565
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:29,547
you must live a safe

566
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:30,787
and happy life.

567
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:35,668
Drink it.

568
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:36,948
Okay.

569
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:43,827
It's nice.

570
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:14,268
Tan Jiao.

571
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:18,067
I'm sorry.

572
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:24,508
I just can't put you in danger again.

573
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:10,707
Are you sure you want
to keep this from Tan Jiao?

574
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,587
Is everything ready?

575
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:18,468
Let's go. Let's go to this place

576
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:19,788
and catch that brat.

577
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:20,428
(Wu Yu,)

578
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:22,828
(let's trade Tan Jiao for Wu Miao.)

579
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,267
(I'm waiting for you
at No.11 Jianhua Road.)

580
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,707
(Tan Jiao, I'm sorry.)

581
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:49,868
(I can't put you in danger again.)

582
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:51,547
(No matter what happens,)

583
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,559
(you must live.)

584
00:35:35,028 --> 00:35:35,707
Yu?

585
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,320
What are you doing here?

586
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,747
How did I fall asleep?

587
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:44,988
But you didn't sleep for long.

588
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:46,428
It's okay.

589
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:47,747
Don't worry.

590
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:50,828
What time is it now?

591
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:52,027
Now?

592
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:52,747
Wu Yu?

593
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,239
Wu Yu?

594
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,041
Where is Wu Yu?

595
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,654
Are you thirsty? Let me get you
a glass of water.

596
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,320
Yu!

597
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,881
Where is Wu Yu?

598
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:05,587
Are you guys

599
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,988
hiding something from me?

600
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:08,428
No.

601
00:36:08,828 --> 00:36:10,028
I mean, he...

602
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:14,667
When did I fall asleep?

603
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:16,147
Could it be...

604
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:20,508
Could it be that soup just now...

605
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:21,667
Dear,

606
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:22,948
it wasn't my idea.

607
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,620
Don't blame me.

608
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:26,667
Wu Yu did it for your sake.

609
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,028
Don't blame him.

610
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:29,828
So where is he now?

611
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:31,868
Tell me!

612
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,547
