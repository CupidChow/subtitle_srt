Wu Yu!

Today is my birthday.

7
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,879
Are you going to give me a present?

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
Wu Yu, look.

9
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,599
What bird is that?

Hao!

12
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,199
It's a relief to see you here.

13
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,240
You sent me here yourself.

14
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,800
Let me take a good look at you.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,919
Did you...

16
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,199
Were you here the whole time?

17
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,360
I peel a lot of garlic cloves.

18
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,520
I was so worried.

19
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,159
Your mother is quite the something.

20
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,719
Even after the divorce,

21
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,439
she still babysits for
your father's new wife.

22
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,639
She even gave him work to do.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,599
Impressive.

24
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,479
My parents

25
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,919
had an amicable divorce.

26
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,560
Besides,

27
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,840
she has no qualms with Hao's mother.

28
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,560
Don't you dare judge
my mother with your

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,199
mundane mindset.

30
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,120
Fine.

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,199
The bird is gone.

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,439
I check the area,

34
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,120
and nothing suspicious.

35
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,039
Aren't you...

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,599
Hello.

37
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,319
I am Wu Yu.

38
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,039
Hi, I am Zhou Xiaoyu.

39
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,520
Come with me.

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,479
Hurry up.

41
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,599
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,280
You said you wanted to talk to him,

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,520
and now you brought him home
to see your parents?

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
You skipped

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,919
right to the final step.

46
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,520
Miss.

47
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,439
You got it all wrong.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,479
He is the key to finding

49
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,000
my lost memories.

50
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,080
Sir,

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,719
are you my sister's boyfriend?

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,919
I take your silence as a yes.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
My sister has a bad temper.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,759
She grinds her teeth when she sleeps.

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,479
She also snores a lot.

56
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,960
Shut your trap!

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,520
Not a word.

58
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,240
How could you

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,039
tell a stranger something so personal?

60
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,240
So,

61
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,599
the adults have important
matters to discuss.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,759
Go to the kitchen.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,120
For the year Zhu was gone,

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
the bird is the only clue.

65
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,600
I even think

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,560
the note that lured me there last night

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,680
was connected to
the controller of that bird.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,519
Is Officer Shen

69
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,040
investigating this case?

70
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,439
You two are...

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,279
You know each other pretty well.

72
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,680
Why don't you ask him?

73
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Forget about it.

74
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,519
He wouldn't tell me a thing.

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,279
He'll brush me off,

76
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,920
saying it's for the confidentiality

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,319
of the investigation.

78
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,360
I think you two get along very well.

79
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,920
Could you get something out of him?

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,639
Forget it.

81
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,120
I'm just a lowly writer.

82
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,360
I can't deal with him.

83
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,040
Officer Shen.

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,160
You assaulted an officer multiple times.

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Do you enjoy it?

86
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,759
I didn't mean it.

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Sorry.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,680
What brings you here?

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,240
My mother asked me
to deliver your mother

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
some mushroom and jelly ear.

91
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,800
My mother went out.

92
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Brothers and sisters,

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,079
have some fruits.

94
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,600
Brother-in-law.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,560
My sister had
a blind date with that man.

96
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,480
Stop spewing nonsense.

97
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,879
So...

98
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,120
I won't be waiting for her.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
I must get back to work.

100
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,439
Hold on.

101
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,279
By the way,

102
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,480
for your mother.

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,079
Hold on.

104
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,920
Tan Jiao wants to talk with you.

105
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,120
I recalled some clues.

106
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,959
At the lakeside,

107
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
I heard the kidnapper mumble.

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
He said boys were troublesome,

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
girls were better

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
with less resistance.

111
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,519
But no girl went missing.

112
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,600
(I see, all of them were boys.)

113
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,040
There was fresh mud
on the kidnapper's shoes

114
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,279
the other night.

115
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,000
It's probably coir peat.

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,959
It is used for gardening.

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,480
Is it possible the kidnapper

118
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,959
is a gardener at the park?

119
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,439
I noticed it too.

120
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,800
We investigated all gardeners

121
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
in the city's east side.

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,360
We've found nothing so far.

123
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
The targets are all from
the east side of Dali.

124
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,839
Is ransom the motive?

125
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,839
I doubt it.

126
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,040
The kidnapper probably never asked

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,319
for ransom from the families.

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,000
He never contacted them.

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,279
I don't think the kidnapper

130
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,439
kept the kids by his side.

131
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,079
I speculate

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,040
he will make a move very soon.

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,160
Alright.

134
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,279
Don't worry about it.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,959
Don't worry.

136
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,720
Believe in the police.

137
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Yes.

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
Believe in the police.

139
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,480
If you two

140
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,319
manage to recall any new clues,

141
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,439
contact me immediately.

142
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,240
The information is important
to the investigation.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,160
Certainly.

144
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,319
We are all law-abiding citizens.

145
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,160
I must get going now.

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,279
Goodbye, Officer Shen.

147
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,759
Bye.

148
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,040
Shen!

149
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,639
Madam.

150
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,560
Hello.

151
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,360
Right.

152
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,839
My mother

153
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,720
asked me to bring you
these mushrooms and jelly ear.

154
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
She is too kind.

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,079
Pass my thanks to her.

156
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,680
Wait here, I'll get the food ready.

157
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Madam.

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,519
I still have some work.

159
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,319
I'll take a pass.

160
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,439
I'll visit again, okay?

161
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,040
That can't do.

162
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
You should get some food before leaving.

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,079
Hey!

164
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,079
Bye, Officer Shen.

165
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,879
And you're just as inconsiderate.

166
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,200
Shen was transferred

167
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,679
away from the city.

168
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,399
Now that he's back,

169
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,679
you two are in the same city.

170
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,519
Can't you...

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,919
A new friend?

172
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
Her old friend left.

173
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,799

Hello.

Wait here.

179
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,440

That can wait.

We have matters to tend to later.

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,559
We won't be eating here.

184
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,679
You should eat before you get to work.

185
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,279
It's good to have work.

186
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,639
The young should have their own space.

187

Indeed.

188
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,960
I was young once.

189

I get it.

190
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,840
Alright, you two can carry on.

What's on your mind?

192

Nothing.

Don't scare me.

Just once.

How did you find my shop?

210
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,879
The motorbike was so loud.

211
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,360
I couldn't hear what I said.

212
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,519
How did you catch that?

213
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,399
I have superpowers.

214
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,519
I don't buy it.

215
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,519
Refrain from going out

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
or going out alone.

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,639
(This is the red-naped tern.)

345
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,480
(It's an endemic species of the area
of the South Pacific Ocean.)

346
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,720
(But it's here in Dali.)

347
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,639
(And it showed up)

348
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,759
(in every kidnapping case.)

349
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,879
Wu Yu!

350
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,799
Wu Yu!

351
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,039
Wu Yu!

352
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,320
Wu Yu!

353
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,799
What is it?

354
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,840
Did you see Hao?

355
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
- Hao?
- He went missing.

356
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,240
I also found this

357
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,200
on the balcony.

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,680
I got this.

359
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,480
Wait.

360
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,240
Take me with you.

361
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,559
No, it's too dangerous.

362
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,599
But he is my brother.

363
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,920
Are you alright?

364
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:53,960
I'm alright.

365
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,880
I hope Hao is safe.

366
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,240
What if the bird

367
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,759
is just a decoy?

368
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,200
What is it?

369
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,440
There is a kid's shoe

370
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,240
one kilometer from here.

371
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,599
I don't see anything from here.

372
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,279
What does it look like?

373
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,839
A yellow canvas shoe.

374
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,240
A yellow canvas shoe?

375
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,400
That's Hao's shoe!

376
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,480
It's his shoe!

377
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
That's the man from the park.

378
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,720
Where is Hao?

379
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,960
I can't see anything from here.

380
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,799
Look closer.

381
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,720
What is the man holding?

382
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,240
It's a modified hunting rifle.

383
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,279
I'll try

384
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,359
rescuing them.

385
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
No.

386
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,839
What if the bad guy comes back?

387
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,880
It's too risky.

388
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
He has a gun.

389
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Maybe...

390
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
Maybe we should call the police.

391
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
Wu Yu! Wu Yu!

392
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,519
Shen Shiyan,

393
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,680
this is Tang Jiao.

394
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,880
(Why isn't he tied up?)

395
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,279
Have you seen

396
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,799
other kids in here?

397
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,799
Maybe Hao got away.

398
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
Leave now.

399
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,160
It's not safe here.

400
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,480
Let's work together

401
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,720
and get these kids out of here.

402
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Stay still.

403
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,000
Did you hear me?

404
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,000
Silence!

405
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,440
Stop crying!

406
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,400
Stop crying!

407
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,440
Stop crying now!

408
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,960
Stop crying! Stop!

409
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,079
You're too loud!

410
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,519
I'll get the kids.

411
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,279
Yes.

412
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:44,759
Who's there?

413
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,640
Sorry. Time to go.

414
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Wu Yu!

415
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,799
Wu Yu!

416
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,279
Tan Jiao,

417
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,119
watch out!

418
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,000
Tan Jiao?

419
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,559
Tan Jiao?

420
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,680
Tan Jiao?

421
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,119
Tan Jiao?

422
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,240
Wu Yu.

423
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,839
You finally awoke.

424
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,480
Are you feeling better now?

425
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,119
How is Hao?

426
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,640
Forget about him.

427
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,359
It was a false alarm.

428
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,400
I'll make him pay for this.

429
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,759
But it wasn't for nothing.

430
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,680
We found the kidnapper's den.

431
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,839
After you fell,

432
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,599
Shen Shiyan arrived in the nick of time.

433
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,240
He got the kids and me out of there.

434
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,960
Don't worry.

435
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,599
He and his team are
looking for the kidnapper.

436
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,119
I'm glad everyone is safe.

437
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Not everyone.

438
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,440
You were unconscious for half a day.

439
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,240
Luckily, it's just a scrape.

440
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,039
The doctor says

441
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,200
you must

442
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,519
rest well for the next few days.

443
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Have some water.

444
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,599
Don't move.

445
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,440
Let me do it.

446
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,799
Stay still.

447
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,440
It's hot.

448
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,119
Take another sip.

449
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,319
See?

450
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,559
You wouldn't let me tag along.

451
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,000
But when the time called for it,
my slipper saved the day.

452
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,119
I saved you.

453
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,039
Rest well.

454
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,039
Thanks.

455
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,839
You haven't eaten anything.

456
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,119
You must be starving.

457
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,799
I'll get you some decent food.

458
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,279
Wait here.

459
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,680
I'll be right back.

460
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,720
What should I get him?

461
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,720
Noodles?

462
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,400
Are you sorry now?

463
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,440
I shouldn't have sneaked out

464
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,000
to buy the Trendy Drumsticks.

465
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,039
and made you worried.

466
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,640
(Yu,)

467
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,279
(bring some clothes to the hospital.)

468
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,279
I'm back.

469
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,359
I noticed you seem
to like noodles a lot.

470
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,160
I bought you some.

471
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,160
I hope you like them.

472
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,920
Here.

473
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,599
Try it out.

474
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,039
Let me do it. Stay still.

475
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,039
Here.

476
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,640
Is it too salty?

477
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,279
I'll get you some water.

478
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,240
Have some water.

479
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,720
That feels great.

480
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,839
Again?

481
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,759
Yeah.

482
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,160
What are they doing?

483
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,279
Yu?

484
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,960
I didn't see anything!

485
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,319
Yesterday I thought

486
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,119
you're making too little progress.

487
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,759
Perhaps I was too narrow-minded.

488
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,960
You two are already

489
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,160
getting so intimate.

490
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,079
I've told you

491
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,119
it was a misunderstanding.

492
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,759
My nose wasn't feeling well.

493
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,279
I was sneezing.

494
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,000
- Yeah.
- Hello.

495
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,119
I'll believe everything you say.

496
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
It's already 2022.

497
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,440
Why are the bad guys

498
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,079
still dragging people into the forest?

499
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,000
Can't they just do it in a building

500
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,920
with elevators?

501
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,960
It's not easy to locate them there.

502
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,319
At least the building
has air conditioning.

503
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,680
I feel so sorry for my Zhu.

504
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,160
It's alright.

505
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,480
I'm safe and sound now.

506
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,200
Thanks.

507
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
(Payment)
Are you hungry?

508
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,519
Come.

509
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,880
I bought you some food.

510
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,319
Yu, you're always so nice to me.

511
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,319
Of course.

512
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,640
Coffee.

513
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,200
- Thanks.
- And a sandwich.

514
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,759
Things got so risky back there.

515

How did you get away?

516
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
You...

517
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,799
What's wrong with you?
Why are you smiling?

518
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,799
What's so funny?

519
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,519
It's nothing.

520
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,799
Hold on!

521
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,920
I didn't add sugar to it.

522
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:08,799
Really?

523
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,599
Yeah.

524

Are you two keeping

528
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,400
something from me?

529
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,000
No.

530
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,720
I'll pay the bill.

531
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,720
Finish the food.

532

You are really getting on my nerve.

533
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,039
Thanks, Yu.

534
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,440
It really tastes sweet.

535
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,559
Did you finish the IV drip?

536
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,000
You don't need to go now.

537
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,319
Lay down and rest for a while.

538
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,319
I can pack your things.

539
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,200
We got some solid results today.

540
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,240
We'll go to the police station tomorrow

541
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
and see if Shen Shiyan
has found anything.

542
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,319
By the way,

543
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,240
I think we are going to solve

544
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,799
this mystery very soon.

545
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,240
From now on,

546
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,119
stay away from the investigation.

547
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,279
What do you mean?

548
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,880
I mean it literally.

549
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,960
I don't want to partner up with you.

550
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,920
Why not?

551
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,559
I thought it went well.

552
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,039
Stop joking around.

553
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,039
I'm not joking.

554
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,240
Wait.

555
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,640
Why are you acting
like a different person?

556
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,559
The two of us

557

Aren't we friends?

561

That's your wishful thinking.

562
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,319
Stay out of my business from now on.

563
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,599
