And that is being reckless

Defaming someone's work

is not good.

Most importantly,

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,580
since you are here with your girlfriend,

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,050
you shouldn't ignore her.

53
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,210
And you shouldn't simply invite

54

another girl for a meal.

55
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,330
Let me give you some useful advice.

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,490
Cherish the one by your side.

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,930
Or else, you'll lose her one day.

And you'll regret it.

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,460
to find out more about what happened.

171
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,650
Are you alone here?

172
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,860
It's you.

173
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,860
Shen Shiyan?

174
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,740
What a coincidence.

175
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,930
You were sent to Jinghai, right?

176
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,410
You are back so soon.

177
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,170
So, both of you are the witnesses

178
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,980
of this case?

179
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,650
When you saw the suspect,
what time was it?

180
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,050
It was around nine.

181
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,410
Why did you

182
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,100
go to such a deserted place
so late at night?

183
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,980
I...

184
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,340
We...

185
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,770
We were on a date.

186
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,740
I...

187
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,690
Girlfriend.

188
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,410
Are you okay?

189
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,770
I heard that you fell into the water.

190
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,930
Are you okay?

191
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,980
Don't worry about me.

192
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,930
This is my fault.

193
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,650
But it was too unlucky for me.

194
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,500
Let me tell you.

195
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,620
First, I had a rear-end collision.

196
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,650
Then, my tire busted.

197
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,220
When I got to the park,

198
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,860
they told me

199
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,380
that you were already sent here.

200
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,410
The car in front of me is to be blamed.

201
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,810
Do you know who he was?

202
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,140
So, you've lost such a young kid.

203
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,220
Isn't this Officer Shen?

204
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,100
Thanks to you,

205
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,340
the kid has been found.

206
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,050
Tan Jiao, I was just passing by.

207
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,050
I'll contact you later.

208
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,570
Bye.

209
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,260
Please wait.

210
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,140
Lady.

211
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,810
If you run away again,

212
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,570
I'll take it that you are
absconding from fear.

213
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,530
Why did you say

214
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,980
that we were on a date?

215
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,570
Because there'll be less trouble.

216
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,690
Are you going to tell the officer

217
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,620
that you mysteriously
lost one year of your life?

218
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,740
And

219
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,890
that you received a note
from a mystery man.

220
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,100
Do you think he'll believe you?

221
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,020
Looks like you are very close

222
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
to that officer.

223
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,530
Better than what I have with you.

224
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,500
Anyway, I won't lie to them

225
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,290
about us being on a date.

226
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,890
We were just on a date.

227
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,980
Why do we have
to go through so much trouble?

228
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,860
I already told you

229
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,170
everything I know.

230
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,620
We are just doing our job.

231
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Please be understanding.

232
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,650
Name?

233
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,650
Tan Jiao.

234
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,050
Age?

235
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,930
I'm 25.

236
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,140
Occupation?

237
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,810
Wait, Shen Shiyan.

238
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,740
You know my name,

239
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,290
age, height, hobby, address

240
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,740
and my partner's criteria

241
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,410
very well.

242
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,260
Why do you still need to ask me again?

243
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,620
She writes novels. She's a novelist.

244
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,740
This is just a standard procedure.

245
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,740
Name?

246
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,260
Name?

247
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,050
He's asking you a question.

248
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,340
Honey.

249
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,570
The officers are just doing their job.

250
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,260
They just need to confirm
your personal information.

251
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,690
Just talk to them. It's fine.

252
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,740
Wu Yu.

253
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,220
Okay.

254
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,690
Now, let's talk about the case.

255
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,380
Wait.

256
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,810
That's it?

257
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,410
It's not fair.

258
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,380
You asked me so many questions just now.

259
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,500
You should ask him those questions too.

260
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,170
For example, his age, his occupation,

261
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,220
his address and other things.

262
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,410
Are you really a couple?

263
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,050
How long have you been together?

264
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,100
Three days.

265
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,020
It was love at first sight.

266
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,020
How could you say that?

267
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,740
We've been together
for more than a year.

268
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,570
We met on a cruise

269
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,500
a year ago.

270
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,930
But

271
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,020
we had a misunderstanding back then.

272
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,050
If you don't believe me,
you can check it with the cruise.

273
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,570
You'll find our information there.

274
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,690
The name of that ship

275
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,570
is called the Diamond Star.

276
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,650
- We went there on...
- Enough.

277
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,410
That has nothing to do with this case.

278
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,100
Let's talk

279
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,170
about tonight's incident.

280
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,810
Especially about the features
and appearance of that man.

281
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,930
I was in a flurried manner back then.

282
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,290
I didn't take a good look at him.

283
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,810
There have been many
child kidnapping cases lately.

284
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,930
They are an abominable syndicate.

285
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,770
So far, you are the only witnesses.

286
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,570
So, I hope

287
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,290
that you can think about it carefully

288
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,260
to give us some clues
to solve this case.

289
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,620
We were at Hubin Park

290
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,140
near the edge of a small forest.

291
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,500
He appeared all of the sudden.

292
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,620
I think he's around 1.8m tall.

293
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,530
He was wearing black.

294
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,980
But it was too dark.

295
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,930
I couldn't see him well.

296
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,290
He was wearing a black coat.

297
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,020
His knuckles are bigger than normal.

298
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,570
He has a mole beside his ear.

299
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,810
You saw him so clearly?

300
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,770
We have a photo here.

301
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,330
Please check
if they are the same person.

302
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,660
This is him.

303
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,610
(Ward)

304
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,370
Shen Shiyan.

305
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,530
Don't tell my mum

306
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,370
about what happened today.

307
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,460
I don't want her to worry.

308
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,050
How is it?

309
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,220
Are you okay?

310
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,530
I'm fine.

311
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,900
They just asked me some questions.

312
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,500
Don't worry.

313
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,180
How can you be fine?

314
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,050
You fell into a lake.

315
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,740
How can you be fine?

316
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,570
I'm so worried about you.

317
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,420
Let me send you home.

318
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,290
Are you just going to leave like this?

319
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,610
Name?

320
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,330
Zhou Xiaoyu.

321
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,810
Age?

322
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,610
I'm 25.

323
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,370
You don't look like 25.

324
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,900
Is it against the law
to look more mature?

325
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,610
Occupation?

326
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,020
Postgraduate student.

327
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,500
I write novels in my free time too.

328
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,530
Are you a novelist too?

329
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,130
Do you write romance novels too?

330
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,050
I go for sci-fi and horror.

331
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
What a peculiar taste.

332
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,370
I know I deserve a punishment.

333
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,260
But you don't have to belittle me.

334
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,370
Okay.

335
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,530
Since you want to be punished,

336
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,460
let's talk

337
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,940
about how you should
be punished for today.

338
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,660
This is under
the traffic police's jurisdiction.

339
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,940
What has it got to do with you?

340
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,420
First,

341
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,980
you were on the phone while driving.

342
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,500
Second,

343
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,370
you ran the red light.

344
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:43,740
Third,

345
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,220
you lied and attempted
to run away after the accident.

346
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,610
Four.

347
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,660
You lied to an officer on purpose.

348
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,740
My kid went missing.

349
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,530
What? You lost your kid?

350
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,770
Let me find my kid first.

351
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,420
We can discuss

352
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,370
the car repair issue tomorrow, okay?

353
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,260
I'm a police officer.

354
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,810
Stop your car by the roadside first.

355
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,180
Then, tell me about the situation.

356
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,530
Stop.

357
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,850
Say no more.

358
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,460
I...

359
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,980
Stop it.

360
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,420
I know I was wrong.

361
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,460
What should I do now?

362
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,610
For the first, second, and third,

363
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,420
I'll leave it
to the Traffic Police Department.

364
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,050
As for the fourth,

365
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,460
the severity of it

366
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,500
will depend on the nature of it.

367
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,530
Make it as minor as possible then.

368
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,180
The most minor one.

369
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,290
Okay?

370
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,530
Please.

371
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,770
I'm just a student.

372
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,900
I have a bright future

373
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,290
ahead of me.

374
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,460
How about this?

375
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,980
In my next novel,

376
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,180
I'm going to write
about an attractive male lead.

377
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,420
And I'll name him Shen Shiyan.

378
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,810
What do you think?

379
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,850
I'll turn you

380
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,220
into a popular man.

381
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,290
Do you know

382
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,130
that you are bribing a police officer?

383
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,940
I'm here to build a good image

384
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,740
for law enforcement officers.

385
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,220
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,290
You can go back for tonight.

387
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Leave your phone number with me.

388
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,500
I'll inform you
when we have the result tomorrow.

389
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,530
Okay.

390
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,940
I can leave now, right?

391
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,050
Go.

392
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,660
Bye.

393
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,400
(Zhou Xiaoyu)

394
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,770
See?

395
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,980
You can fool me.
But you can't fool the police.

396
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,700
But this is good.

397
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,770
Although I didn't get to meet the person

398
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,050
who sent me the note,

399
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,810
I met you.

400
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,980
What does it mean?

401
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,980
It means that fate

402
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,330
has brought us together

403
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,700
so that you can tell me

404
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
what happened on the cruise

405
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,500
and help me recover
the one year I lost.

406
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,770
Go back, take a hot bath

407
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,610
and take a vitamin C tablet.

408
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,940
By the way,

409
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,940
I need to apologize to you

410
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,740
for something.

411
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,770
I remember that I had misunderstood you

412
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,050
on the cruise.

413
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,940
But...

414
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,090
But at the time, I really didn't know

415
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,420
that she was your sister.

416
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,130
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,180
This apology
has been late for a year.

418
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,330
Why did you refuse to admit

419
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,420
that you are Wu Yu?

420
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,330
Did something happen?

421
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,770
Another thing.

422
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,740
You said that you were there today
to look for something.

423
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,020
What were you looking for?

424
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,660
Is that related to the incident too?

425
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,370
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm not the person you know.

427
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,290
What do you mean?

428
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,260
Don't tell me

429
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,090
that you just coincidently

430
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,530
have the same name as that man,

431
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,700
and that you happen
to look the same too.

432
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,220
Why do you refuse to admit

433
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
that you know me?

434
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,290
Why are you so weird?

435
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,460
You said that you don't know me, right?

436
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,530
Why do you keep following me then?

437
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,980
I stay in the hostel of the repair shop.

438
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
It's right across your house.

439
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,770
You are still following me.

440
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,850
Wu Yu.

441
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,020
Wu Yu, come here.

442
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,500
- Wu Yu.
- What is it?

443
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,460
Which one will look better
on the cruise?

444
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,850
This one or this one?

445
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,810
What about this dress?

446
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,530
Wu Yu.

447
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,660
Drink some water.

448
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,810
Why are you using

449
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,460
my favorite hair tie to tie around
your papers again?

450
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,090
(Cherish the one by your side.)

451
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,570
(Or else, you'll lose her one day.)

452
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,460
(And you'll regret it.)

453
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,850
Who is it?

454
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Why don't you check

455
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,290
before you open the door?

456
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,940
Why are you here?

457
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,050
My dear Qizhu

458
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,610
has gotten into such
a terrible incident today.

459
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,130
Of course I have to come here
and keep you company.

460
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,090
You came here because

461
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,980
you are lazy

462
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,180
to go home, right?

463
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,940
Don't expose me.

464
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,530
But I need to lecture you about this.

465
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,810
When you are alone at home,

466
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,740
don't simply open the door.

467
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,130
What if that person is

468
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,940
a bad person?

469
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,130
I know. Don't worry.

470
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,810
Look.

471
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,810
I've put a pair of male slippers here

472
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,940
to scare them.

473
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,980
I don't have another pair of slippers.

474
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,460
You can wear these first.

475
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,770
- They are so big.
- Let me get you a glass of water.

476
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,500
Who can you scare

477
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,290
when you keep the slippers inside?

478
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,850
You went to meet the person

479
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,700
who left the note for you, right?

480
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,850
How did you end up with Wu Yu

481
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,530
and become a witness of the case?

482
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,810
How would I know?

483
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,530
I think this string of events

484
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,020
is not a coincidence.

485
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,700
Think about it.

486
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,610
Everything that you've
gone through lately

487
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,850
has one thing in common.

488
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,940
Wu Yu keeps showing up by your side.

489
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,530
Maybe I'm thinking too much.

490
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,850
But is there a possibility

491
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,810
that everything has happened

492
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,940
because of him?

493
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,260
Who is it? Ask.

494
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,570
Who is it?

495
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,530
Let's go.

496
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:50,940
Jiao.

497
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,220
Hello, Miss Yu.

498
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,940
Why are you here?

499
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,810
Why are you here so late at night?

500
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,530
Where's your dad?

501
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,020
My dad is your dad.

502
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,660
You should say our dad.

503
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,850
Be nice.

504
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:04,980
My dad...

505
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,740
No. Our dad

506

678
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,530
By the way,

679
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,820
what happened on the ship?

680
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,130
I've lost parts of my memories too.

681
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,380
But not the whole year.

682
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,300
I should say

683
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,020
that I've lost parts of my memories
on the ship.

684
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,250
How should I say it?

685
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,940
I remember leaving the ship.

686
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,820
I remember meeting you on the ship

687
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,050
and going through that misunderstanding.

688
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,860
But I lost my memories
about what happened

689
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,780
after the misunderstanding.

690
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,690
What happened?

691
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,250
To make it even weirder,

692
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,610
for a period of time,

693
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,900
I didn't realize

694
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,860
that I had a memory loss.

695
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,130
Just like my mum and Zhuang Yu.

696
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,210
They didn't realize

697
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,340
that I was gone for a year.

698
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,380
I've asked the other tourists too.

699
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,090
They are experiencing
the same thing as me.

700
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,130
What happened on the ship

701
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,460
has become a mystery.

702
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,820
So, does it mean
that I can't recover my memories

703
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,170
for that one year?

704
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,610
That's not quite true.

705
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,860
Look at these photos.

706
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,020
These are the photos

707
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,530
of the children
who were kidnapped, right?

708
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,020
How are these photos

709
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,250
related to me?

710
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,500
This bird showed up

711
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,610
in all of those photos.

712
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,020
You've noticed that too.

713
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,610
This bird showed up on the ship too.

714
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,210
This is a red-naped tern.

715
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,090
It's an endemic species of the area
of the South Pacific Ocean.

716
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,250
But it showed up in Dali.

717
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,090
And it showed up

718
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,300
in every kidnapping case.

719
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,610
Jiao.

720
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,780
Hello, Miss Yu.

721
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,300
Why are you here so late at night?

722
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,020
Where's your dad?

723
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,570
My dad is your dad.

724
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,300
You should say our dad.

725
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,300
Be nice.

726
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,050
This is bad.

727
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,530
I think this bird

728
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,940
was looking at my brother last night.

729
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,650
Where is he?

730
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,050
It's 103 Huayuan Road.

731
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,730
It's after three more junctions.
