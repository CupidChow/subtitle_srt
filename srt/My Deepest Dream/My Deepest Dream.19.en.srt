Wu Yu, Tan Jiao.

21
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,568
The specifics of the murderer
and the prediction you gave

22
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:20,809
are precise.

23
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,688
But, if you don't have the proof,

24
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,049
it can't explain

how you foresee the future event.

Shen Shiyan.

00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,568
I understand you can't accept

29
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,769
everything you have heard.

30
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,888
But, they are all truths.

31
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,049
Please believe in us.

32
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,448
I can explain this to you later.

33
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:43,329
There's no need.

34
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,089
All I need is evidence.

35
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,448
So that I can be responsible
for all the victims.

36
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,168
Shen Shiyan.

37
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,408
I'd bet my life on them.

38
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,568
Please trust them, alright?

39
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,489
I'm a cop

40
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,408
and I can't let my emotion

41
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,168
cloud my judgement.

42
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:05,688
What is wrong with you?

43
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,049
I'm leaving now.

44
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:09,809
Yu.

45
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,128
I'll go and check her out.

46
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:12,969
Yu.

47
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:14,848
Zhuang Yu. Yu.

48
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:16,128
What's wrong?

49
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:16,848
I'm so pissed off.

50
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,568
He's just staid

51
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,249
and rigid.

52
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,448
Shen Shiyan has his own reason.

53
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:24,529
I understand.

54
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,249
After all, he's a cop.

55
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,649
If he believes in us blindly,

56
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:29,089
he'll be

57
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,209
an unqualified cop then.

58
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:35,489
Anyway, I don't wish you
would have a bad impression of him

59
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,529
because of this.

60
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,329
Officer Shen.

61
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:42,128
I guess you're curious

62
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:43,969
of why we could foresee

63
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,008
the murderer's plan

64
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,809
as well as

65
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,608
the encounter
between you and Zhou Xiaoyu.

66
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:50,769
It's simple.

67
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,049
Because we came from the future.

68
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:18,368
I watched this game before.

69
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:21,329
The final result is four to one.

70
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,569
The reason why we came to you

71
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,368
is because you were on our side

72
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:36,928
in three time-travelings before.

73
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,168
Three time-travelings?

74
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:45,889
Yes.

75
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:49,209
The time Tan Jiao and I experienced
keeps moving backwards.

76
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,368
We met both of you every time.

77
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,728
This is the fourth time we meet.

78
00:04:59,009 --> 00:04:59,808
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:01,209
So,

80
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:04,608
you still can't believe us, can you?

81
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:07,769
Wu Yu, do you know?

82
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,129
Everything you said

83
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,408
is beyond belief.

84
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:20,408
To you,

85
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,889
all these things have yet to happen.

86
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,529
But to me,

87
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,889
they were all the history in my memory.

88
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:26,569
After the murderer kills tomorrow night,

89
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,649
his next target

90
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,048
is my sister.

91
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:45,608
Wu Yu.

92
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,048
I've talked to Zhuang Yu.

93
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:48,209
She's going with us today.

94
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:49,969
We'll definitely catch that bad guy.

95
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,209
Although I can't fight

96
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,209
like Shen Shiyan does,

97
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,848
I can take photos of the incident.

98
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,649
I'll record the proof.

99
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:57,689
No need.

100
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,569
I've thought it over.

101
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,209
Zhuang Yu and you
must stay at home today.

102
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,488
Why?

103
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,969
The enemy we're facing
is unlike the previous one.

104
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,129
I can't put both of you in danger.

105
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,449
What if something bad happens to you?

106
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,769
If I don't call you by 2:30 a.m.,

107
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,209
call the police.

108
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:15,769
No way.

109
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,889
You can't go there alone.

110
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:18,889
This is too dangerous.

111
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:23,089
Wu Yu.

112
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:24,209
Zhuang Yu and I will go with you,

113
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,288
please.

114
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,689
Eat breakfast.

115
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,168
Look, who's here?

116
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:38,408
Shen Shiyan.

117
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:40,728
Yesterday,

118
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,129
I checked with my colleague
who's in charge of the case

119
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:43,048
after I went back.

120
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,488
The information you provided is real,

121
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,288
including that football game.

122
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:50,529
That means

123
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:51,969
you trust us now, right?

124
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,368
Although, I still can't come around

125
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:55,969
to the fact that you're from the future,

126
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,009
this incident

127
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,009
is likely to harm

128
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,248
the safety of the people.

129
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,608
If you're right

130
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:01,728
about the murder case,

131
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,288
I must capture the culprit.

132
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:06,408
But, I'm doing this personally.

133
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:07,769
I'll go with you tonight.

134
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:10,288
I know I'm right about you.

135
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,089
Hey.

136
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:19,969
But, on one condition,

137
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,009
you must report everything to the police

138
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:23,889
after this.

139
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:26,649
Of course.

140
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,288
Since you promised to help us,

141
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,969
you must spare no effort

142
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:32,009
to investigate that jerk.

143
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:32,769
Do you hear me?

144
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,808
Oh?

145
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,168
Staid.

146
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:39,608
Officer Shen.

147
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,129
Let's go through the information.

148
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:45,569
This is the murder scene

149
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:47,848
and Xu Jingmiao's workplace.

150
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,126
(Music Bar)

151
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,048
If you're really from the future,

152
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,329
you must know more

153
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:29,009
about this case than me though.

154
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:31,769
Everything I knew

155
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,528
is from the police document,

156
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:35,728
which was told by Ding

157
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:37,329
after my sister was murdered.

158
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,368
Tan Jiao and you
have travelled across time

159
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,768
several times.

160
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,929
Didn't you find any new threads?

161
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,848
The murderer is cunning.

162
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,169
So, this time

163
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,209
is our best chance to capture him.

164
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,049
We were close to the thread

165
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,248
in every time travel,

166
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:53,888
however, they're
a bit different somehow.

167
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:56,329
Therefore, I can't be sure

168
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,049
about the murderer now.

169
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,209
There must be
an unnoticeable breakthrough.

170
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,049
I still have a question.

171
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,969
Tan Jiao and you have travelled
across time several times,

172
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,608
is there anything that didn't change

173
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,248
in the previous universes?

174
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,329
The thing

175
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:18,728
that never changes

176
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,528
is only you and Zhuang Yu.

177
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:25,888
Both of us?

178
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:26,728
Yes.

179
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,689
Regardless of the changes and dangers
we've encountered,

180
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,888
Zhuang Yu and you would show up.

181
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:35,089
Strangely.

182
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:36,969
Every time we met you,

183
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:38,008
something bad happened.

184
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:40,008
I wonder if bad luck falls on us

185
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,488
or you.

186
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:49,008
Honestly, we're lucky.

187
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,008
Even if

188
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,848
you were in danger every time

189
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,128
or you found what we told you
unacceptable,

190
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,449
your decision never changed.

191
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:00,728
Just like now.

192
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:03,248
Then,

193
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,329
in every universe,

194
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,728
Zhou Xiaoyu and I...

195
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:08,648
You are always together.

196
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:16,488
To be frank,

197
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,248
I have no idea

198
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,488
why I would believe in your saying

199
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:23,089
about time travel and superpower.

200
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:23,809
Aren't these things

201
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:24,848
only found in novels?

202
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:36,289
Do you think

203
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,728
they'll get angry?

204
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:39,128
Of course, they will.

205
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:39,969
Staid Shen

206
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:40,728
will surely drive us back,

207
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:41,969
saying that it's dangerous.

208
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,409
Wu Yu will definitely say...

209
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:44,648
No.

210
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:45,689
He'll...

211
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:48,969
- Where are they?
- Where are they?

212
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:51,368
No idea.

213
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:52,608
What are you doing here?

214
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,248
We want to help you.

215
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,689
Just take us as your assistants.

216
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:01,248
Right?

217
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:02,728
It's dangerous being here.

218
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,809
That's why

219
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,089
I'm worried about you.

220
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,409
Plus, we've overcome
so many difficulties together

221
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:09,449
previously, haven't we?

222
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:35,008
Camera showed that

223
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,128
Xu Jingmiao was last seen

224
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,689
at 2:20 a.m.

225
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:40,449
I think that guy will be around here.

226
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,728
She's walking in our direction.

227
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,848
Don't go home. Someone is tailing you.

228
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,528
Run now.

229
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:11,528
Tan Jiao.

230
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,528
Stay in the car with Zhuang Yu.

231
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,329
Call the police.

232
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:14,329
Okay.

233
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:30,209
I go around from the back.

234
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:30,888
You follow behind her.

235
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:31,648
Okay.

236
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,488
Stop it!

237
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:13,689
Stand right there.

238
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,128
Wake up.

239
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:44,049
Where's the person?

240
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:45,128
I lost him.

241
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,049
He ran away.

242
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,008
What about Xu Jingmiao?

243
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,209
She was sent to the hospital.

244
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:51,689
What has happened?

245
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,969
We received a report
that someone intended to kidnap.

246
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,368
I'm Shen Shiyan, from
the Municipal Criminal Police Force.

247
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,329
Request police in this area

248
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,528
to search around the district.

249
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:01,569
The suspect is around here.

250
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:02,888
He's dangerous.

251
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,449
He wears a bucket hat, medium height

252
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:05,049
and with a knife.

253
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,089
When did you know Chen Xingjian?

254
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:18,049
I'm not close to him.

255
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,329
It's been a long time
since I last talked to him.

256
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,329
When was the last time you saw him?

257
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,569
Two weeks ago, I think.

258
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,569
He was a lounge singer in the bar.

259
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,449
Chen Ningmeng,

260
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,169
Liu Xiaojiang, and Ye Xunyi.

261
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:34,768
Do you know these names?

262
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,209
I've never heard of them before.

263
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,289
I don't know them.

264
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,409
Well, Miss Xu.

265
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,728
I hope that you can try to recall it.

266
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,449
- Please. I want to go home, please.
- Shen.

267
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:47,648
We've found Chen Xingjian.

268
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:49,569
You've been working all night.
Go back and rest.

269
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,008
I'll handle the rest.

270
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:00,409
How's it now?

271
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,648
It's fine.

272
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,848
Anyway, the culprit is found.

273
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,409
Everything will be clear.

274
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:10,569
Are you hungry?

275
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:11,648
I've bought you supper.

276
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:12,888
Eat it while it's hot.

277
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:18,728
Excuse me.

278
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:20,169
Two beers, please.

279
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:20,728
- Thank you.
- Give me a moment.

280
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:23,368
The scene in which Chen Xingjian
was captured

281
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,008
differs from what you described.

282
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,409
Just minor details, anyway.

283
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,728
Probably some minor specifics

284
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:32,809
were changed in the end

285
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:33,888
after we told

286
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,608
Shen Shiyan.

287
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,528
Hope so.

288
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:40,888
Thank you.

289
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:41,888
Come on.

290
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:42,809
Let's celebrate

291
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,329
that Chen Xingjian
is finally captured

292
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:45,689
and

293
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,089
Miao is safe now.

294
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:07,608
You must be tired.

295
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:09,409
Rest early.

296
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:17,768
Erm...

297
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:19,929
Thank you for your supper.

298
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:22,289
Erm...

299
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:24,929
Take a good rest.

300
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:28,209
I'm closing the door.

301
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:29,608
Sure.

302
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,329
Bye-bye.

303
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:37,248
Wait.

304
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:38,768
Yes? Anything?

305
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,449
I'm thirsty.

306
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,248
Can I have some water?

307
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:43,728
You're thirsty?

308
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:45,929
Come on in.

309
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:46,728
Thank you.

310
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:01,409
Please sit.

311
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,248
I'll get you some water.

312
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:02,888
Sure.

313
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:15,609
Go, Zhou Xiaoyu.

314
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:16,609
Don't be scared.

315
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,248
The great scene in your love life
is coming.

316
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:20,609
Come on.

317
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,768
Please drink some water.

318
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,169
Sure, thank you.

319
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:37,609
So, you're really thirsty.

320
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:42,328
It's late now.

321
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,689
Rest early.

322
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:46,649
Remember to lock your door.

323
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,889
So, he came in just for the water?

324
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:52,488
Sorry?

325
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:54,328
Nothing.

326
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,369
It's my fault.

327
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:59,649
How would a staid guy flirt?

328
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:05,129
You must be worn out, right?

329
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:07,169
We'll discuss it later.
About you and me.

330
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,488
You can go back and take good rest.

331
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:10,929
Sure.

332
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,488
About you and me?

333
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:20,488
Nothing.

334
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,248
Tan Jiao is coming back soon.

335
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:33,048
What are you doing?

336
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:34,649
Zhou Xiaoyu.

337
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,849
I know you might find it absurd,

338
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,768
but I think I've fallen for you.

339
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:45,649
I've never had this strong feeling
before.

340
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:47,969
I feel like I've fallen for you

That's because

00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,768
we've been in love many times.

344

Really?

345
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:00,248
Yes.

346
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,008
What are you waiting for?

347
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:05,689

Walk slowly.

Master Qizhu.

358
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:51,048
I need your help.

359
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,209
Help me out.

360
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:53,889
Miao.

361
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:54,768
Be careful.

362
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,048
What happened to him?

363
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,008
He's hammered.

364
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,849
He never drinks this much before.

365
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,889
He's happy today.

366
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:03,849
So, he drank a lot.

367
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:07,169
Did you two patch up?

368
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,409
Why are you with him at this late hour?

369
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,129
Careful.

370
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:11,409
Did you really patch up?

371
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:13,969
Come in.

372
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:15,129
Hold onto him.

373
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:16,288
Careful.

374
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:20,568
Hold onto him, Miao.

375
00:20:21,328 --> 00:20:21,808
Sit.

376
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,889
Did you stay at home

377
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,048
without going anywhere tonight?

378
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:27,209
Of course.

379
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:28,689
Wu Yu didn't allow me to hang out.

380
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,768
He forced me to fold origami stars.

381
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:32,728
Zhu Yutong and I both have sore hands.

382
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:35,528
Miao.

383
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,209
You must take care

384
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:38,528
and don't simply go out by yourself.

385
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:40,889
Wu Yu cares about you very much.

386
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,288
I know.

387
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,008
But, sometimes he's too strict with me

388
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,048
like I'm a three-year-old child.

00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:56,889
Jiao.

392
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:58,528
I won't interrupt you then.

393
00:20:58,728 --> 00:20:59,689
I'm going to bed now.

Of course, I was going to text you.

No.

Don't overthink.

452
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:35,568
Nothing has happened.

453
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,768
It's not what you think.

454
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:45,528
You drive me crazy.

455
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:47,568
Yesterday,

456
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:49,169
I was waiting for you the whole night.

457
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,209
I was so anxious

458
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,129
that something might happen to you.

459
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,008
Good for you.

460
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,449
You were staying with Shen Shiyan,

461
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,649
enjoying your sweet time together.

462
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:58,248
You have left me behind.

463
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:00,169
It's not what you think.

464
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:02,169
Nothing happened between us.

465
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,649
I accompanied him
to work late into the night.

466
00:26:10,209 --> 00:26:11,169
Massage my legs.

467
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,008
Well.

468
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:14,409
Tell me.

469
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:16,689
How are you going to compensate me?

470
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:18,969
I'll treat you to a feast.

471
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:21,969
No.

472
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:23,409
Lipstick?

473
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:27,409
Let's go shopping.

474
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,209
I'll buy anything you like.

475
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:29,808
Is that okay?

476
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:30,969
Deal.

477
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,248
Hold on.

478
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,288
I left in a rush

479
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:52,969
and threw my clothes onto the bed.

480
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,409
Supposedly,

481
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:55,849
if you stayed here last night,

482
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,129
my clothes wouldn't be here.

483
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:01,288
I was cleaning up just now

484
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,169
and I left it there.

485
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:07,169
After I observed you closely,

486
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:09,728
the clothes you're wearing
are the same as yesterday's ones.

487
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,288
Plus, the water heater isn't plugged in

488
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:17,568
and the floor is dry.

489

Tan Jiao.

490
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,209
You didn't come back home yesterday.

491
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:21,889
Am I right?

492
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:23,248
No.

493
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:23,889
I won't answer you.

494
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:25,449
No?

495
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:26,488
Don't come near, Zhuang Yu.

496
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:27,568
- You...
- No.

497
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,288
You lied to me.

498
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:34,969
Dear.

499
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:36,649
Tell me more

500
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:37,889
about my story with Staid Shen.

501
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:39,969
Didn't I tell you?

502
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:41,689
You've been together for three lives.

503
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:46,288
I'm curious about

504
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,528
the details of
the three different lives.

505
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:50,169
You said

506
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,768
I bumped into his car previously.

507
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:52,568
What happened then?

508
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:55,328
Greedy girl.

509
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:57,008
Is a sweet not enough for you?

510
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:58,728
Yet you ask for more.

511
00:27:58,929 --> 00:27:59,768
I'm planning

512
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:01,568
a grand date for him.

513
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,288
I'm sure he never sees

514
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,849
something like this in his life.

515
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:06,248
I want to scare him.

516
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:07,449
Scare him?

517
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,568
I don't think so.

518
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:12,169
You want to overwhelm him
with sweetness, don't you?

519
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:13,248
Nonsense.

520
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:14,129
Stop making fun of me.

521
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:14,889
How dare you?

522
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:16,328
Are you going to fill his heart
with your love?

523
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:18,488
Zhuang Yu, you're so sweet.

524
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:20,586
(Criminal Investigation Unit of Kaifu
Branch, Jinghai Public Security Bureau)

525
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:24,209
He confessed.

526
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:25,969
Really?

527
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:29,088
Great.

528
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:30,449
But, he confessed
sexual harassment allegation.

529
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,209
He said he had a crush on Xu Jingmiao
for a long time.

530
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:35,689
Yesterday, he's beside himself
and he harassed her.

531
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:37,768
He was crying over his action
last night.

532
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,169
He hopes Xu Jingmiao will forgive him.

533
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:41,649
But, the priority now is

534
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:43,568
that we can't prove

535
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,409
he's the murderer
of the serial killings.

536
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:48,169
What about his alibi?

537
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:48,969
Does he have that?

538
00:28:49,488 --> 00:28:51,088
We've already known

539
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:52,088
the time of the three murder cases.

540
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:54,649
However, no one noticed if he went out.

541
00:28:55,288 --> 00:28:56,248
Therefore,

542
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:57,609
no alibi.

543
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,609
What's the conclusion then?

544
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:01,129
We have to release him

545
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:03,328
if we have no proof.

546
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,328
He's the murderer.

547
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:10,008
You can't release him.

548
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:12,609
You were with me that night...

549
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:13,248
Wu Yu!

550
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:14,088
What's your proof?

551
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,008
If no,

552
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:20,409
how do you prove he's the murderer?

553
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:20,969
I...

554
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:22,889
We've thoroughly searched
Chen Xingjian's place,

555
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,169
the bar where he used to sing,

556
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:25,808
his studio

557
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:27,328
and his car,

558
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,449
but nothing has been found.

559
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:30,889
There's no sign of him
committing a crime at all.

560
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:34,488
Wu Yu.

561
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:36,369
To be on the safe side,

562
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,209
Captain Ding and I will keep a close eye

563
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,248
on him.

564
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:41,209
But for now,

565
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:43,369
we have to release him.

566
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:46,889
Shen.

567
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,649
After Chen Xingjian is released,

568
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:50,849
Huang and you

569
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,849
will supervise him all day long.

570
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:54,288
Never let your guard down.

571
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:55,209
Yes.

572
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:11,088
Wu Yu.

573
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:23,008
Thank you for cooperating with us
throughout the investigation.

574
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:24,728
We're good citizens.

575
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:26,008
It's our duty

576
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:27,088
to cooperate with the police.

577
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:28,288
But, I hope

578
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:29,808
there'll be no such absurdity
happening to us again.

579
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,088
If you're the murderer,

580
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:45,969
I won't spare you.

581
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:49,008
It's fine.

582
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:51,929
I accept your apology.

583
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,849
This is your girlfriend, right?

584
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:04,088
She's so beautiful.

585
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,288
Do keep a close eye on her.

586
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,488
Say that again.

587
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:10,768
Wu Yu.

588
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:30,969
Wu Yu.

589
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:32,929
Nine days more

590
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:33,969
before you leave this timeline.

591
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:35,929
We'll supervise him all day long

592
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,808
to make sure that he won't harm anyone.

593
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,689
Don't worry.

594
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:55,169
Tan Jiao.

595
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,528
Move all your things out
of Zhuang Yu's house.

596
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,169
From now on,

597
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:01,808
you'll stay at my house.

598
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:04,728
Why, Wu Yu?

599
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:06,528
Didn't you hear him?

600
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,209
History changed

601
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,088
since the moment we caught him.

602
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,048
I have no idea

603
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,609
about his plan in the future.

604
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:29,328
No need to change your shoes.

605
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:34,568
Master Qizhu.

606
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,568
Welcome to our house.

607
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:38,409
I've prepared

608
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:39,409
the slippers, toothbrush, and towel.

609
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:43,048
I wonder tonight...

610
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,288
- We sleep together.
- We sleep in separate rooms.

611
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:53,689
It seems you have different opinions.

612
00:32:54,568 --> 00:32:56,288
You may take some time to discuss this.

613
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:58,369
Wu Yu.

614
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,008
Let's dine out tonight

615
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:02,649
to celebrate

616
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:04,288
that you've patched up
with Master Qizhu.

617
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:09,849
Didn't I tell you

618
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,288
that the murderer

619
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:12,369
is likely

620
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,649
to harm Tan Jiao again?

621
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:15,088
So, the two of you

622
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,609
must stay at home.

623
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:17,728
Do you hear me?

624
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:20,409
I have to attend classes though.

625
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:21,409
I'll ask for a leave on your behalf.

626
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:23,969
Why do you drag me in?

627
00:33:25,689 --> 00:33:26,328
Listen to him.

628
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,768
Well, Miao.

629
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,129
You have to understand

630
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,849
that Wu Yu is protecting you.

631
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:37,008
Crap.

632
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,808
I know he cares about me.

633
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:40,689
But, I'm bored.

634
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:42,169
Also, I have a business on campus
to deal with.

635
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:43,328
Well,

636
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:46,449
perhaps you put it aside first.

637
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:47,929
After all, your safety matters the most.

638
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:48,649
Listen to your brother.

639
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:50,609
What are you doing?

640
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:53,689
I miss you too.

641
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:10,769
Tan Jiao.

642
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:13,608
Tan Jiao.

643
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:17,369
What's wrong?

644
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:18,849
Do you need my help?

645
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,409
No need.

646
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,449
I just want to make sure you're fine.

647
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:21,889
Never leave my sight,

648
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:22,528
okay?

649
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:27,729
Look.

650
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,769
When you are busy,

651
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,128
I'm out of your sight.

652
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:34,249
Sounds reasonable.

653
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:46,568
Aren't you

654
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,289
being too exaggerated?

655
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,528
It's impossible
that Chen Xingjian has a superpower

656
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,409
and suddenly turns up here

657
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,568
to catch me.

658
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:55,849
Well done.

659
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:57,168
Keep on talking.

660
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:03,048
Are you going to stay outside
the bathroom

661
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:06,329
when I take a shower?

662
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:10,168
What did you say? Louder, please.

663
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:12,849
Nothing.

664
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,048
I said

665
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,889
you're such a discreet

666
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:21,048
and resourceful high achiever.

667
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:25,769
Speaking of this,

668
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,849
you haven't gone to the campus
for a long time.

669
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,488
How could you finish your paper?

670
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,289
I've finished it already.

671
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:32,568
Waiting for the graduation ceremony.

672
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,369
What's your plan

673
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,128
after graduation?

674
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:40,289
Do you want to stay in Jinghai

675
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,608
or Da...

676
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:44,128
What happened?

677
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:47,128
Are you alright? Get up.

678
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:47,608
I...

679
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:48,929
I'm fine.

680
