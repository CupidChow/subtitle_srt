00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,181
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,981
We had no choice.

173
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,620
It's all my idea.

174
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Tan Jiao has nothing to do with this.

175
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,341
It's still because of that timeline
you mentioned, right?

176
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,301
Yes.

177
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,101
What I said is real.

178
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:29,301
At the crime scene last time,

179
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,740
I really caught him.

180
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,620
But I don't know
why it has changed this time.

181
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
I will continue

182
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,500
to investigate this matter for you.

183
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:40,620
Don't ever do this again.

184
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:43,620
I got it.

185
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,101
Do you remember Captain Ding saying

186
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,020
he felt like he'd seen you before?

187
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,581
I have a hunch

188
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,061
that this time,

189
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,660
everyone has been affected.

190
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,581
Everyone seems to have
some memories of the past.

191
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,101
That person changed his plan.

192
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:32,101
Oh no.

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,020
We lost our only advantage.

194
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,461
But when will he make his move again?

195
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,221
Today?

196
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:43,620
Or tomorrow night?

197
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,740
He is bloodthirsty and brutal.

198
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,780
There is no way he will stop.

199
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,140
Don't worry.

200
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,620
As long as we keep targeting on him,

201
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:58,301
we will catch him.

202
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,260
I'm feeling more helpless and terrified

203
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,101
than I did when Miao's body was found.

204
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,101
I really don't know what else I can do.

205
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,421
I can ask for Shen Shiyan's help.

206
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,020
How about

207
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,660
locking Miao up in CID's office?

208
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,461
I don't believe

209
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,181
that person is capable of
hurting Miao in front of the police.

210
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,020
But how long are you going
to keep her in there?

211
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,380
A week?

212
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,900
A month?

213
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:52,780
Or a year?

214
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,421
Everything has changed now.

215
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:56,941
Even we do not know

216
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:59,101
when Wu Miao will really be safe.

217
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,301
You can't lock her up forever, can you?

218
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,260
Have you ever thought that

219
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,461
it's because

220
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,500
you've been treating her like a child,

221
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,301
that you haven't told her the truth?

222
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,780
Maybe she knows better and is smarter

223
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,260
than we thought.

224
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,941
When she learns the truth,

225
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,821
she will protect herself well.

226
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:31,020
But she will be scared, won't she?

227
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:34,941
She will.

228
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,181
When I first learned about all this,

229
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,061
I was so frightened too.

230
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,620
But whenever I am in danger,

231
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,301
you will always

232
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,581
show up in time

233
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:47,780
and protect me.

234
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,620
As time passed by, I feel that

235
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,061
I'm not alone

236
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:53,540
against the world.

237
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,461
I have you.

238
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,981
Wu Miao has such
a great brother like you.

239
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,061
I'm sure she will

240
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:04,900
feel the same as I do.

241
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:06,860
Trust me.

242
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:18,941
♪Try to remember
when life was so tender♪

243
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:24,821
♪That no one wept except the willow♪

244
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,900
♪Try to remember the kind of September♪

245
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,540
Miao.

246
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:30,941
Miao!

247
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,421
I have something
very important to tell you.

248
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,581
Tan Jiao,

249
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:45,421
is all of this true?

250
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,101
Miao,

251
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,860
do you remember

252
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,581
how I told you that day that

253
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,780
you could sing Try to Remember well?

254
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:02,461
That's because

255
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,380
we have gone to this concert together.

256
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,860
You were invited on stage at that time.

257
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,341
This is the song you sang.

258
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:12,260
What happened then?

259
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,740
Then...

260
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,701
Sorry.

261
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,101
We didn't stay until November 5.

262
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,780
We don't know what happened after that.

263
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,421
Alright now.

264
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,540
Don't be scared.

265
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:33,821
It's alright.

266
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,380
Miao,

267
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,020
you have to believe
that your brother and I

268
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,981
will protect you

269
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,701
very, very carefully.

270
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,260
We have travelled through time
so many times

271
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,260
just to save you.

272
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,500
You understand?

273
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,140
Tan Jiao,

274
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:54,900
I'll only cry this time.

275
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:59,500
I'll be strong after this.

276
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,981
I'm not going to let you
and Wu Yu worry about me.

277
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:12,780
Miao.

278
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,901
I used to treat you like a child,

279
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,901
but now

280
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,221
I want you to help us

281
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,221
as my teammate.

282
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,621
Let's catch that bad guy together.

283
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:28,580
Okay?

284
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:33,540
Wu Yu,

285
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,381
I will listen to you from now on.

286
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,300
I won't go anywhere,

287
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,181
but I'm not afraid of him.

288
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,580
Our parents are looking out
for us in heaven.

289
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,300
Besides, I have you.

290
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,740
You are right.

291
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,020
Dad, Mom and I

292
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,820
won't let anyone hurt you.

293
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,300
Miao.

294
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,540
What are you doing?

295
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,861
I'm in the shop.

296
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:46,461
Why are your eyes red?

297
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:49,181
Babe, I miss you so much.

298
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:51,540
Well...

299
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:53,701
There is no one in the shop.

300
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,300
I will take you to
the amusement park this afternoon.

301
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,901
Okay?

302
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,060
No.

303
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,421
We won't be seeing each other
for a few days.

304
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,260
My brother said

305
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:03,701
I'd be in danger these few days.

306
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:04,981
I can't leave my house.

307
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,981
Wait for me at home.

308
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:07,780
I will be right over.

309
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,141
I will leave her to you.

310
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,421
Miao.

311
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,461
Babe.

312
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,540
Why are you crying?

313
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,300
What's wrong?

314
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,141
You just told me

315
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,181
you'd be in danger.

316
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:50,780
What happened?

317
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,421
You can't tell me?

318
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm just worried that you won't
believe me even if I tell you.

319
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:59,020
I will believe you.

320
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,060
I will believe anything you say.

321
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,981
Even if you tell me Earth is square,

322
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:04,941
I will believe you too.

323
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,181
My brother said

324
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,981
there is a bad guy out there.

325
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,861
A murderer.

326
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:13,421
He has killed five girls.

327
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,941
I am his last target.

328
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:15,740
Did...

329
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,461
Did you get any threat letter?

330
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,421
Have you called the cops?

331
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,421
There isn't any threat letter.

332
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,901
Other people won't believe us.

333
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,580
That's why my brother

334
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,500
asked me to stay at home
over the past few days.

335
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:33,060
I just promised him I would stay strong,

336
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,300
but I really want to cry.

337
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,221
You have no idea how much

338
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:42,421
my brother has gone through for me.

So is Tan Jiao.

Yet I can only stay in my room.

I can't do anything to help.

342

Alright, Miao.

343

Don't cry.

Will you always be with me?

352

Of course.

353
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:19,780
I don't know what is going on,

354
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:23,300
but if someone wants to hurt you,

355
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,181
he will have to get past me first.

356

will you protect Wu Miao with me?

I will.

360
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:44,981
I love Miao.

361
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,500
I will protect her with my life.

Promise me then,

Ten more days later,

366

I'll probably be gone for a while.

367
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,221
I will entrust her safety to you then.

Hang in there, Miao.

You will get better

He never came out after he went in.

She was knocked out.

She's awake now.

Right.

510
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,901
There is a guy too.

511
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:23,141
You are annoying.

512
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,820
You always ruined my plans.

513
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,020
And there were many times

514
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
the girl was already in my hands.

515
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,141
I was so close.

516
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,701
Later,

517
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:49,221
I had no choice
but to kill Chen Xingjian.

518
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:53,540
You know,

519
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,381
it wasn't that easy to find a puppet

520
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,100
that was so obedient.

521
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,260
I... I don't understand
what you are talking about.

522
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,141
W-who is Chen Xingjian?

523
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:08,580
I don't know what you are talking about.

524
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:11,381
But I want you to know that

525
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:14,341
I have camera on me.

526
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,620
The police will be here soon.

527
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,500
Release me now.

528
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,140
It's not too late.

529
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:22,020
Shut up!

530
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,301
How dare you threaten me!

531
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:31,981
I have to kill you,

532
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:33,901
and that guy.

533
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,700
And then, I will kill all those girls.

534
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,660
None of you can escape.

535
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,741
None!

536
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,821
This is not right.

537
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:02,580
This drag mark is too suspicious.

538
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:04,941
The pressure seems off too.

539
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:05,580
That's right.

540
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,741
For the weight of an adult woman,

541
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:08,620
this won't be right.

542
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,461
It feels like he's misleading us.

543
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,981
If they had gone in another direction,

544
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:14,781
they would have left a different trail.

545
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:16,741
Let's look again.

546
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:40,781
Anyway, as long as
I have a little consciousness,

547
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:42,381
I will leave traces

548
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,781
for people who are looking for me.

549
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,060
In real life,

550
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,381
the killer won't give you any chance.

551
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,381
I will create my own chance then.

552
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:54,461
For example, I can dig a hole,

553
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,060
or scratch a few marks on the wall,

554
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,741
I can spit on the ground.

555
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,461
The point is
I will try to leave a trail.

556
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,660
I won't give up on saving myself.

557
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:07,461
This way.

558
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,580
Are you sure it's this way?

559
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,100
Yes.

560
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,301
Want to know how you'll die?

561
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,261
Here comes the highlight!

562
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,220
I have more than a dozen potions here,

563
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:35,540
each of which will kill you.

564
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:39,741
But some work fast, some slow.

565
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:42,421
If you're unlucky,

566
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,301
and I pick the slowest one,

567
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
you will experience

568
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,660
a long and slow death.

569
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:04,540
Let's load this gun

570
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,660
with its ammunition, shall we?

571
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:08,540
No.

572
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,421
Actually, you are not as annoying
as they are.

573
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,220
I can give you a quick death.

574
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,741
What do you say?

575
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,020
(Tan Jiao,)

576
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,540
(you mustn't fall asleep.)

577
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,381
(You are the heroine.)

578
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:28,341
(Heroine will be saved
at the last minute.)

579
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,461
(You won't die.)

580
00:37:32,261 --> 00:37:33,060
Let's pick this.

581
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,461
This will give you a rapid death.

582
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,580
You will feel nothing.

583
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,220
Wait a minute.

584
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:42,781
Who are you really?

585
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,901
Why do I find

586
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:47,821
your voice so familiar?

587
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:54,461
Alright, the preview is over.

588
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,461
I know you can't wait.

589
00:37:57,861 --> 00:37:58,821
Here we go.
