Don't take me wrong.

29
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,507
It was because the jerk freaked me out
just now,

30
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:01,706
so I reacted violently.

31

But, if you think it was too much,

Do you feel better now?

The doctor said

39
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,226
that jerk gave you an injection
which triggers neuritis.

However,

49
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,826
it's me lying here this time.

50
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,307
I'd rather lying here for you.

51
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:05,586
No.

52
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,747
It's better if both of us

53
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:12,226
are in one piece.

54
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:15,867
By the way,

how's the murderer now?

56
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:19,226
Is he arrested?

57
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:20,947
Do you know who he is?

58
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:22,906
Someone we know?

59
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,947
No wonder he kept wearing a mask.

60
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:31,627
Also, I think his eyes
seem familiar to me.

61
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:35,507
Who's he?

62
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:37,226
Zhou Wei.

63
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,307
She has something

64
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:11,226
to tell him.

65
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:22,667
Don't go near him.

66
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:24,466
Just stand there.

67
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:26,547
Zhou Wei.

68
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,627
It was you.

69
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:33,986
But

70
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:36,547
I can't believe this.

71
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,346
But

72
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,746
why did you do that?

73
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,346
It was really easy to gain your trust.

74
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:47,826
Tan Jiao.

75
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,787
Didn't you claim
that you know human nature well?

76
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:53,787
Tell me.

77
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:56,866
Why did you kill those girls?

78
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,027
Why did you want to kill me?

79
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:04,547
Are you curious?

80
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:20,547
I want to know.

81
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:43,586
Tell me.

82
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:49,067
Behave.

83
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:49,626
Cuff him.

84
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:53,466
Are you alright?

85
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,427
I'm fine.

Wu Yu.

87
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:00,506
Take her and leave this room.

88
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,267
Let's go.

89
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:04,626
Come.

90
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:12,826
Wu Yu.

91
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,187
Did you see his eyes?

92
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:16,387
He isn't Zhou Wei.

93
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,187
At least he's not that Zhou Wei
we met on the island.

94
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,706
Previously, when Zhou Wei
was going to kill me,

95
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:20,986
he talked a lot to me.

96
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,267
However, he seems

97
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,746
to be unfamiliar to me.

98
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:24,826
It's the same case
with Chen Xingjian.

99
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:25,866
When we were on the island,

100
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,267
he didn't seem like he was lying
when he talked to us.

101
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:29,826
True.

102
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:32,027
Did you realize something?

103
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,986
The two were completely different from

104
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,746
when they were on the island.

105
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,746
This is so weird.

106
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,826
Did you kidnap Chen Ningmeng?

107
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:45,226
Zhou Wei.

108
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,346
We have proof

109
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,226
in our possession.

110
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,307
You better be honest

111
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,626
and own up to your mistake.

112
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,586
Did you kidnap Tan Jiao

113
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,106
and Chen Ningmeng?

114
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,187
Also, do you have
the malice aforethought

115
00:10:57,187 --> 00:10:59,027
of killing Chen Ningmeng, Liu Xiaojiang,

116

Ye Xunyi and Xu Jingmiao?

117
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,506
They are deservedly murdered.

118
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,106
They should've died earlier.

119
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,626
None of them is kind.

120
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:09,427
How did they offend you?

121
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:13,067
They claimed to be just and upright.

122
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,866
But in fact, they're murderers

123
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:19,267
who killed someone with their keyboard
in the dark.

124
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:21,746
They took away Jie's life,

125
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:24,586
but they never get punished.

126

I knew Jie through the internet

127

and she's my first love.

128

Every night,

134
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:54,947
we would chat

late into the night.

Starting this afternoon,

a girl kept calling in and scolding me.

and ask him to delete the post.

00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,387
I didn't take these photos.

173
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:09,866
It doesn't help if I delete my post.

174
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,307
The netizens will still spread them
to other places.

175
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,866
Waste of time.

176
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,346
Later, we went to see the photographer.

177
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:19,187
It's Chen Ningmeng.

178
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,067
We asked her to delete
all those pictures.

179
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:25,027
Well, it's deleted.

180
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:26,267
Geez.

181
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,027
I'm not interested in
taking such photos of you on purpose.

182
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:29,106
The pictures were published by a netizen

183
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:30,346
and some of them were retouched
intentionally.

184
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,307
It's hard to tell the difference
between real and fake pictures.

185
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,626
Enough.

186
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:39,667
Afterwards,

187
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:41,466
we met

188
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:43,907
Liu Xiaojiang, the one
who exposed Jie's personal information.

189
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,547
She's a returning student.

190
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:48,466
And Ye Xunyi

191
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,626
who kept making hoax calls to Jie.

192
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,427
She harassed Jie

193
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:53,547
because her boyfriend saved

194
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:54,947
Jie's pictures in his phone.

195
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:56,866
She thought Jie seduced her boyfriend.

196
00:14:57,787 --> 00:15:00,147
Later, things went serious
and beyond control.

197
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:03,626
Those pictures started to spread

198
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,626
among Jie's workplace, family,

199
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:09,187
and neighborhood.

200
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:10,787
Everyone

201
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:14,387
thought she was an indecent
and brazen girl.

202
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,187
They gave her nicknames,

203
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:20,083
cast her out,

204
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:21,427
and even bullied her.

205
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:56,746
Jie!

206
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:00,787
Those who insulted her,

207
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:02,706
published the pictures,

208
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:04,626
and took her photo,

209
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,307
all of them think

210
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,226
that they are normal

211
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,267
and innocent.

212
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:11,826
But, they are the culprit

213
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,947
that caused Jie's death.

214
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:17,226
Therefore, all of them

215
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,746
must pay for it.

216
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,067
What about Tan Jiao?

217
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,267
Because Wu Yu and her
kept disturbing me.

218
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,027
So, I must kill her.

219
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:29,387
Otherwise, I can't avenge Jie.

220
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:30,466
Well.

221
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,907
We've listened to your story

222
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,907
and Chen Ningmeng was saved.

223
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,506
Naturally, you can't

224
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:38,147
continue your revenge plan.

225
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,267
No.

226
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:42,586
No way.

227
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:43,746
No.

228
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:48,187
Chen Ningmeng, Liu Xiaojiang,

229
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,387
Ye Xunyi and Xu Jingmiao.

230
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,267
All of them must die.

231
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:54,826
They all have to die.

232
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,067
They all have to die.

233
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:56,586
Behave.

234
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,506
They all have to die.

235
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:58,907
They all have to die.

236
00:16:58,907 --> 00:16:59,586
Behave.

237
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,787
They all have to die.

238
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:02,067
They have to die.

239
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:02,506
Stay put.

240
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:04,026
They all have to die.

241
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,907
The patient is emotionally unstable.

242
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:07,786
Can you please leave this room?

243
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,147
Please leave.

244
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:09,986
They all have to die.

245
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:10,907
Huang, stay here.

246
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:13,147
They all have to die.

247
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:14,546
They all have to die.

248
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:17,266
They all have to die.

249
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,466
They all have to die.

250
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:22,266
They all have to die.

251
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,746
They all have to die.

252
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:33,627
Do you believe what he said?

253
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,867
Shen Shiyan has verified

254
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,187
his statement about Ren Jie.

255
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,026
Besides, the three girls
apart from Chen Ningmeng

256
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,947
have confirmed too.

257
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:45,147
I didn't expect

258
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,506
that a trivial action seemed to them

259
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:48,506
would develop into a tragedy today.

260
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:50,986
That's how the internet influences us
nowadays.

261
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,306
Everyone merely thinks

262
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,786
their comments are insignificant,

263
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,706
yet every comment they make
would turn into

264
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:58,466
a knife that kills someone.

265
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,266
Do you empathize with Zhou Wei?

266
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:10,986
No.

267
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:14,546
I sympathize with him,

268
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,427
but I disapprove of his action.

269
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,026
He's manipulated by hatred

270
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,746
and that led to more hatred.

271
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:24,147
You've seen how he treated me

272
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,066
as well as

273
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:26,746
the scene just now.

274
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,226
I think Zhou Wei

275
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,066
can't get himself under control.

276
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:33,627
He has become a maniac.

277
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,546
Is there anything disturbing you?

278
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:46,506
I reckon something is off.

279
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:47,947
Think about it.

280
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:49,786
He has the memory
from the last time travel,

281
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:51,706
so he changed his action

282
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,667
and planned to kill us before he acted,

283
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,627
which makes some sense.

284
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:57,306
What about Wu Miao?

285
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:58,427
She has nothing

286
00:18:58,427 --> 00:18:59,546
to do with this,

287
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,587
and she doesn't appear
in Zhou Wei's target list.

288
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:03,986
You're right.

289
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,266
Zhou Wei said

290
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,466
because we got in his way,

291
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,187
that he had no choice
but to kill Chen Xingjian.

292
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,546
He also mentioned that Chen Xingjian

293
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,506
is under his thumb.

294
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:24,986
When we were on the island,
Chen Xingjian said

295
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:26,986
he and Zhou Wei weren't on good terms.

296
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,226
And they haven't contacted each other
for a long time.

297
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,506
It's impossible that Chen Xingjian
was his accomplice in the murder.

298
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:36,387
Logically speaking, since Chen Xingjian
is died

299
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:37,546
and Zhou Wei is arrested,

300
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:39,786
we're supposed to know the truth now.

301
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,746
But, I wonder

302
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:43,786
why I'm getting more confused now.

303
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:47,786
Let's leave this to the police.

304
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:48,947
At least,

305
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,226
we've captured him.

306
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:58,026
Does it still hurt?

307
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,226
You were terrified, right?

308
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:03,427
Of course.

309
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,907
Luckily, I told myself

310
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:07,867
not to cry,

311
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,306
because I'm the female lead

312
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,627
and I wouldn't die.

313
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,867
Wu Yu will definitely show up

314
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:13,986
and save my life

315
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,066
at the crucial moment.

316
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,226
Thanks to the self-comforting,

317
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,187
I didn't cry.

318
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:26,226
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,506
Why do you apologize?

320
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:31,466
Didn't you save my life in the end?

321
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:35,667
But, if you could

322
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,266
come a bit earlier,

323
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,147
you would be cooler.

324
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:47,306
It's my mum.

325
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:53,306
Mum.

326
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:54,947
Jiao.

327
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:56,667
I came to Jinghai for you.

328
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,907
Are you surprised?

329
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:00,947
I'm done.

330
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,546
My mum is here.

331
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:05,947
I just got in the taxi.

332
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,867
Give me Zhuang Yu's address now.

333
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,026
I miss you so much.

334
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:11,387
Mum.

335
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:13,026
Zhuang Yu

336
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,466
is preparing for her exam
these two days,

337
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:15,387
she's busy now.

338
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,746
I don't think it's a good idea
if you go there now.

339
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,746
Why not?

340
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,466
I'll cook delicious food for you there.

341
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:23,226
It's a good idea.

342
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:24,466
A brilliant idea ever.

343
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,347
Sir, please hold on.

344
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:27,107
I want to go...

345
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:28,347
Hurry up.

346
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,306
The taxi driver is waiting.

347
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:29,907
Alright.

348
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:31,147
I'll send you the address right away.

349
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,266
Good.

350
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,266
Wait for me, my dear.

351
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,627
Bye-bye.

352
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,066
My mum is coming.

353
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,066
What do I do now, Wu Yu?

354
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,066
Look at me now.

355
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:45,947
How about this?

356
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:46,947
Do you think

357
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:48,907
she'll trust me

358
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,667
if I tell her I fell?

359
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,226
Aunt.

360
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,066
You must be tired now.

361
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,427
Drink some water.

362
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:00,226
Zhuang Yu.

363
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,387
No need to entertain me.

364
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,066
I know you're busy

365
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,066
with your exam now.

366
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:05,867
Go and study.

367
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,226
I'll just look around here.

368
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,706
Your house is so well-furnished.

369
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:12,226
It's beautiful.

370
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,387
You may go to revise.

371
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,026
No need.

372
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:15,066
I just look around here.

373
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,147
It's fine. I'll accompany you.

374
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,306
This...

375
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,546
Why is there only one blanket
and a pillow

376
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:22,706
on the bed?

377
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,907
How do you and Jiao sleep then?

378
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:28,667
Aunt.

379
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:29,667
Tan Jiao

380
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,387
is too disciplined.

381
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:32,907
Every day after she wakes up,

382
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:35,466
she keeps the pillow and blanket

383
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:36,986
in the cupboard.

384
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,546
I've told her many times

385
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:39,546
not to do this.

386
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:41,706
But she still insists.

387
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,706
This girl has never been

388
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,187
so disciplined at home.

389
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,667
Wow, this is an open kitchen.

390
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:49,627
What a modern design.

391
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:50,986
This is the bathroom, right?

392
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,147
It's well-furnished too.

393
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:55,306
Good design.

394
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:56,387
Well.

395
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:57,867
This is the shower area.

396
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:58,627
Yes.

397
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,466
Is this your towel?

398
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,427
It's mine.

399
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:05,187
Toothbrush and face wash.

400
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,466
This toothbrush is yours, right?

401
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:09,306
Where's Tan Jiao's toothbrush?

402
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:13,466
I...I've put Tan Jiao's towel

403
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:14,587
into the washing machine.

404
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,506
I...I'm going to wash it later.

405
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,627
And her toothbrush...

406
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:19,466
Toothbrush...

407
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:20,506
Good question.

408
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:22,827
Her toothbrush is broken.

409
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:23,347
Aunt.

410
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:23,867
You know it, right?

411
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:26,347
Electric toothbrushes can break easily.

412
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:27,266
It's really annoying.

413
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:27,947
True.

414
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:30,226
Zhuang Yu.

415
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:32,867
Why did Tan Jiao

416
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:34,827
come to Jinghai this time?

417
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:36,867
Zhu is a writer.

418
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:40,827
Maybe she's out of ideas.

419
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,627
So, she came here to visit me.

420
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,506
What did she tell you?

421
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:51,706
Zhuang Yu.

422
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:52,266
My mum...

423
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:53,667
Mum.

424
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,667
You're fast.

425
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:56,226
Why are you...

426
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,546
Put your bag down.

427
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:58,986
Your forehead...

428
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,026
Ouch, mum.

429
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:03,867
What's wrong with your forehead?

430
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:12,026
Mum.

431
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:15,387
I fear that you wouldn't allow this.

432
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,347
So, I didn't tell you.

433
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:19,387
Actually...

434
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,587
I came to Jinghai

435
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,226
for plastic surgery.

436
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,107
Plastic surgery?

437
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:27,907
Nonsense.

438
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:28,587
You're so pretty.

439
00:24:28,587 --> 00:24:29,706
There's nothing you need to fix.

440
00:24:31,546 --> 00:24:32,907
Well, I seek perfect beauty.

441
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:36,746
So, I got a botox injection
to remove forehead wrinkles.

442
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,746
There's no way
that you have forehead wrinkles.

443
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,746
You're young. How can there be wrinkles
on your forehead?

444
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,786
There are a few.

445
00:24:44,427 --> 00:24:45,827
You really pissed me off.

446
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,347
Well, as long as you're alright.

447
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:49,546
I'm going to cook you some food now.

448
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,026
Gosh, forehead wrinkles?

449
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,827
- Thank you, mum.
- Troublesome girl.

450
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:53,986
Forehead wrinkles?

451
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:56,026
It's more convincing
if you say that you fell.

452
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:58,667
Don't touch it. It hurts.

453
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,266
You know nothing about my mum.

454
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:04,066
If I told her that I fell,

455
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:04,986
she'd be anxious and

456
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:06,347
worried about me afterwards.

457
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,187
But, if I told her

458
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:09,387
I got a botox injection
for forehead wrinkles,

459
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:11,107
she'd just

460
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:12,587
nag me for some time.

461
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:13,427
It's a small case then.

462
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,746
I can't eat anymore. I'm full now.

463
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:19,427
Aunt.

464
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,907
The food is absolutely delicious.

465
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:22,506
I haven't shown you my speciality.

466
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:24,347
Hey, I eat chillies as snacks

467
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:26,306
since I was young.

468
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:27,427
However,

469
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:28,986
you can't take spicy food at all.

470
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:29,746
I really doubt

471
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:31,107
if I took the wrong baby home.

472
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:31,867
Wrong baby?

473
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,706
But, you still raised me happily.

474
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:34,947
Are you sure I'm happy?

475
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:36,347
Since when did you see me happy?

476
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:37,066
Zhuang Yu.

477
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:38,387
The year when she just turned eighteen,

478
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:38,907
I was hoping

479
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:40,427
she could bring a boyfriend home.

480
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,147
I keep waiting and anticipating

481
00:25:42,147 --> 00:25:43,427
until now.

482
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:44,466
Oh, please.

483
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:45,827
If I was seeing someone at that time,

484
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:46,947
I'm sure you'd beat me to death.

485
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,347
No worries, aunt.

486
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:52,907
Tan Jiao will bring back

487
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:55,066
a tall, handsome
and well-educated boyfriend

488
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:55,907
very soon.

489
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:56,867
Don't worry.

490
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:57,947
Thanks, Zhuang Yu.

491
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:58,947
From your lips to God's ears.

492
00:25:58,947 --> 00:25:59,907
If what you said comes true,

493
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,627
I'll cook you a feast

494
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,587
with many delicious dishes.

495
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,226
I'll thank you in advance then.

496
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,587
To be honest,

497
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,587
Shen, the guy you met last time

498
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:10,746
is really good.

499
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:11,546
I just couldn't understand

500
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:12,907
why you didn't contact him then

501
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,187
and be with him.

502
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:16,226
Shen is a pretty good guy.

503
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:16,627
Right?

504
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:17,587
Am I right, Zhuang Yu?

505
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:19,226
Oh, geez.

506
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:21,387
Aunt,

507
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:24,147
what if there is a man
who is 1.8 meters tall,

508
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,947
graduated from a prestigious university
with a doctorate

509
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,107
and works as a scientist.

510
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:29,066
Moreover, he takes good care of Tan Jiao
and he's very manly.

511
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:30,786
What do you think about it?

512
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:32,187
My goodness.

513
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:33,907
I'll be on cloud nine.

514
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,147
Really, mum?

515
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:37,427
If I have a boyfriend like this,

516
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,827
do you agree?

517
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:41,427
Is your mum a fool?

518
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:43,107
Only fools won't agree with this.

519
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:44,427
Geez, this girl.

520
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,466
Well, we've done eating.

521
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,147
I'm going to clear up the dishes.

522
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,427
Bravo.

523
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:56,466
Do you really think

524
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,506
I'll stay at Zhuang Yu's place?

525
00:26:58,546 --> 00:26:59,986
Didn't you always tell me

526
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,506
that you young people
need your own space?

527
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,546
You have it now.

528
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:04,587
I've booked a hotel room already.

529
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:05,387
Don't worry.

530
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:06,627
Mum.

531
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,667
Did you really mean that just now?

532
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:09,466
Of course.

533
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:10,627
Look, I didn't bring my luggage here.

534
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:11,986
I've put them in the hotel.

535
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:13,266
I'm not talking about this.

536
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,986
If I really

537
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:16,706
have a boyfriend like that,

538
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:18,107
will you agree?

539
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,147
I won't if I'm a fool.

540
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,306
You'll get no argument from me.

541
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:24,226
No.

542
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,506
And from your dad too.

543
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:29,706
Come here.

544
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:35,147
Mum.

545
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:39,466
Nice to meet you.

546
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,746
I'm Wu Yu.

547
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:42,506
Let me give you a ride to the hotel.

548
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:44,947
Who's he?

549
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:47,627
Mum.

550
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:49,506
He's my boyfriend,

551
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,266
Wu Yu.

552
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:54,187
No need.

553
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:55,867
We'll take a taxi ourselves.

554
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:57,867
Mum.

555
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:58,986
Didn't you say

556
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:00,667
you'll have no argument
if I have a boyfriend?

557
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,147
He's well-educated,

558
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,066
and an ace student.

559
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:05,907
Besides, he's a good man.

560
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:07,066
What's so special about an ace student?

561
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,187
How could he treat you like this?

562
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:11,746
Did he ask you to go for plastic surgery

563
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:13,147
not long after you were with him?

564
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,187
Oi.

565
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:16,667
Are you not satisfied with
my daughter's appearance?

566
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,387
I'm telling you
that I think you're ugly.

567
00:28:18,387 --> 00:28:19,587
You're tall and dark.

568
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,187
No, mum.

569
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,506
What do you mean by "no"?

570
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:23,387
I'm telling you that

571
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,667
my son-in-law doesn't need to be tall

572
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,867
and handsome.

573
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:29,226
It's fine if he has a mediocre
educational background

574
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:30,867
and doesn't earn much.

575
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:32,786
However, I have a request.

576
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:35,187
That's to hold you dear

577
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:36,347
wholeheartedly.

578
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,387
Otherwise, I won't approve
of your boyfriend

579
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:39,867
even if he's a prince.

580
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:41,306
Let's go.

581
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:42,627
Let's go.

582
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:43,387
Stop calling me.

583
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:43,827
I'm leaving now.

584
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:44,427
Let's leave.

585
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:44,786
Go.

586
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:45,266
Bye-bye.

587
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:49,986
Mum.

588
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:52,147
Let me ask you this.

589
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:54,266
Do you really disapprove of Wu Yu?

590
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:55,587
Yes.

591
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:57,226
Why?

592
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:59,506
Do you think I'm a fool?

593
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,226
Why do you need a man

594
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:02,706
who can't protect

595
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,907
you well?

596
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:05,466
That's not true, mum.

597
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:06,427
This has nothing to do with him.

598
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:07,907
It's my own decision.

599
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,107
Enough.

600
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,347
I was tricking you just now.

601
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:13,506
At first,

602
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:15,667
that's what I thought.

603
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:18,627
However, I changed my mind
when I thought it carefully.

604
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,546
With your carelessness,

605
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:22,026
if it wasn't for him,

606
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:22,706
I guess

607
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,266
you must be lying sickly

608
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,466
in the hospital now.

609
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:26,546
Mum.

610
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:28,667
You're smart.

611
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:31,187
Mum.

612
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:36,026
Wu Yu is the one who treats me the best
in this world

613
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:38,266
besides you.

614
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,867
Moreover,

615
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:46,266
both of us

616
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,066
have been through a lot together.

617
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:50,786
He's the one I've been looking for.

618
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,786
So, you've chosen him?

619
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:03,627
Ah, naughty girl.

620
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,786
I hate you.

621
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:05,746
Why?

622
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:08,427
The first time I met my son-in-law...

623
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:10,627
How am I going to face him later?

624
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:13,947
You did well just now.

625
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,306
Nonsense.

626
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:16,107
Alright.

627
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:16,867
It's fine.

628
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:17,986
You're beautiful and elegant.

629
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,347
You're the most beautiful lady.

630
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,280
(Six days later)

631
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:44,066
The second murder should've happened
yesterday.

632
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:45,907
But, nothing has happened
to Liu Xiaojiang.

633
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:46,907
Shen Shiyan has already informed

634
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:48,107
the other two girls.

635
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:49,266
They're all alert.

636
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:50,667
It's difficult for someone
to harm them.

637
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:52,026
Does it mean

638
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,466
that we've made it?

639
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:55,427
Ren Jie's pictures

640
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:56,827
have been found on the internet.

641
00:30:56,907 --> 00:30:58,226
Everything Zhou Wei said is true.

642
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:02,546
Great.

643
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:04,827
I can't believe

644
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,706
that we managed to change our destiny.

645
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:10,667
Wu Yu.

646
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:13,546
Miao is safe now.

647
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:23,506
Tan Jiao.

648
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:25,986
Thank you.

649
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,347
If it wasn't for you,

650
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,667
I wouldn't have persisted until now.

651
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:34,907
We've been working so much.

652
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,746

Good morning, Master Qizhu.

674
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:08,146
Where's Wu Yu?

675
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:11,867
I haven't seen him since this morning.

676
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:13,466
Did he go out this morning?

677
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:14,986
Yes.

678
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:28,626
Why did he slide off this early morning?

679
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:37,506
Master Qizhu.

680
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:38,867
Previously,

681
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:40,867
you said that you came back
from the cruise with my brother.

682
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,026
Wouldn't it be if he went back
to the cruise first?

683
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:47,586
It's impossible.

684
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,146
There are a few days more

685
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,387
before we return.

686
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:51,707
Besides,

687
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,267
we'll go back to the cruise together.

688
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:54,026
Master Qizhu.

689
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:55,666
If...

690
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:57,947
I mean if my brother goes missing,

691
00:34:57,947 --> 00:34:59,106
will you search for him?

692
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,146
Of course.

693
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,546
I'll search for him
in every corner of the globe.

694
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:03,747
Seriously?

695
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:09,626
Wu Miao.

696
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:14,186
Do you really not know where Wu Yu went?

697
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:15,986
I don't know.

698
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:17,307
How would I know?

699
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,307
Stop playing with your phone.

700
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:21,947
Look into my eyes.

701
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,427
Are you lying to me?

702
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:25,827
Tell me honestly.

703
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:26,747
Are you lying to me?

704
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:29,546
Master Qizhu.

705
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:30,747
Stop forcing me.

706
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,387
Wu Yu asked me not to tell you.

707
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:34,026
Otherwise, there'll be no surprise.

708
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:35,506
Surprise?

709
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:39,867
What's it?

710
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,827
I was out of my wit.

711
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,267
I thought the timelines are messed up.

712
00:35:46,907 --> 00:35:48,307
Wonder what they're up to.

713
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,267
It's a surprise, anyway.

714
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:51,787
Just sit tight and wait for it.

715
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:54,947
The thing more romantic
than the romance itself

716
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,106
is anticipating and fantasizing
about romantic surprises.

717
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:58,907
Speaking of romantic surprises,

718
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,827
I've written a lot in my books.

719
00:36:02,506 --> 00:36:03,146
Dear Yu.

720
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:06,907
What surprises do you think
Wu Yu would prepare?

721
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,227
Judging by his dull character,

722
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:12,986
it must be below your expectation.

723
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:16,586
Either he'll play the guitar
and sing a song to you,

724
00:36:17,387 --> 00:36:19,586
or he'll hide a big bouquet of roses
in his car boot.

725
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:22,387
Preserved fresh flowers,
colorful lights and a teddy bear.

726
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:23,867
They are their best props.

727
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:26,546
Gas balloons, confetti
and cold firework.

728
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:27,387
- They are also their...
- Hold on.

729
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,387
What's wrong?

730
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:30,427
Did you just mention

731
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:31,986
gas balloons?

732
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:32,827
Yes.

733
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,867
Gas balloons, confetti
and cold firework

734
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:36,707
are their best friends for a surprise.

735
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:40,626
What do you want to eat later?

736
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:40,947
(Tan Jiao, October 16th,
I wait for you at the usual place.)

737
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:42,307
I want ice cream.

738
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:42,707
(Tan Jiao, October 16th,
I wait for you at the usual place.)

739
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:44,827
Wait for you at the usual place.

740
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:48,626
Tan Jiao.

741
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,347
Not only you'll be my grandeur moon,

742
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,546
but also I want you to stay with me
for good

743
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:54,347
and be my sun.
