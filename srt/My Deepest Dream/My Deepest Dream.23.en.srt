But I feel so uneasy.

15
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,732
Even if Chen Xingjian is innocent
at this moment,

16
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,413
are we going

17
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:43,893
to watch him

18
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:45,813
turn into a heinous killer?

19
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,012
We're indulging him

20
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,813
and supporting him in his crime.

21
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:52,372
So is everything you said just now

22
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:55,453
real?

23
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,492
- Chen Xingjian.
- Wu Yu.

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,110
Tan Jiao.

25
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,910
Wu Yu.

26
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Chen Xingjian.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,790
Tan Jiao.

28
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,550
This...

29
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,390
What's this?

30
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,830
This is too much for me.

31
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,510
I can't digest the message now.

32
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,630
What did I experience

33
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,510
and what made me a ruthless murderer

34
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,430
without fear?

35
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,830
We're curious about it too.

36
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,030
What happened

37
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,790
after you left this island?

38
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,950
Perhaps

39
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,630
I can stay on this island.

40
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,270
What do you mean?

41
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,550
I'm serious about this.

42
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,230
I'll stay on this island.

43
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,990
Just leave me some food.

44
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,470
Preferably, a guitar too.

45
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,990
I'll wait here
until the future incident passes.

46
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,910
You can fetch me then.

47
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,670
I'll stay here alone
for my music creation.

48
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,430
Stop fooling around.

49
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,390
No, I'm serious.

50
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,510
Or

51
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,430
do you know any cops?

52
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,870
Ask them to capture me and lock me up

53
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,510
after we reach the shore.

54
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,430
Release me

55
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,430
after the incident passes.

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,110
But, you don't commit a crime now.

57
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,670
I...

58
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,830
I can.

59
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,670
What about this?

60
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,030
After we reach the shore,

61
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,390
I'll take some snifter

62
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,030
and drunk drive
towards the police station.

63
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,830
So that they can arrest me.

64
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,670
Isn't that settled?

65
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,070
What are you up to?

66
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,790
I'm trying to tell you
that I won't kill anyone.

67
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,670
Do you know how important music is to me?

68
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,710
I love it so much.

69
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,790
No matter what,

70
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,110
I never wish

71
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,990
I'll be a murderer.

72
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,350
Forget it.

73
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,350
You won't trust me
regardless of what I say.

74
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,790
Don't act extreme.

75
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,710
Our priority now is to get out of here.

76
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,150
We'll talk about this after we're out.

77
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,270
This cave is a big labyrinth.

78
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,750
I was lying

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,830
when I said I knew the way out.

80
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,270
Are you depending on the torch

81
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,430
to find the exit?

82
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,950
According to the direction of the flame

83
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,510
to determine the flow of air.

84
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,230
It's a method to escape from the cave.

85
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,430
But, on one condition,

86
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,790
the cave must have a free flow of air.

87
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,910
We're lucky.

88
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,710
Wu Yu, the exit is over there.

89
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,670
Wait.

90
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,390
I know

91
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,510
my words irritate you

92
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,190
and are annoying.

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,870
But,

94
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,110
you'll stop me, right?

95
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,750
I promise you

96
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,950
I'll never become someone like that.

97
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,070
Whether you trust me or not,

98
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,790
I'd like to thank you.

99
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,870
It's been a long time

100
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,230
since I last talked to someone sincerely.

101
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,830
We trust you.

102
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,830
Good.

103
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,350
The exit is ahead of us.

104
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,590
I'll lead you out here

105
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,870
with my righteous figure.

106
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,030
Let's go.

107
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,350
Come on.

108
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,870
Wu Yu. I go and wake Master Qizhu up
for breakfast.

109
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,510
Come back.

110
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,950
Let her sleep for a while more.

111
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,510
Wu Yu.

112
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,830
It's not clean.

113
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,870
You eat this yourself.

114
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,030
I've washed it thoroughly.

115
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,910
Are you sure they're clean?

116
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,990
Wash it again.

117
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,950
No.

118
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,630
Good morning, Master Qizhu.

119
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,630
You're awake.

120
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,830
Wu Yu.

121
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,390
Chen Xingjian was killed by someone.

122
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,750
Then...

123
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,750
What will happen in this timeline then?

124
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,270
What's the date today?

125
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,270
October 4th, 2021.

126
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,870
October 4th.

127
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,870
None of the cases has happened yet.

128
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,470
Yes.

129
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,630
The first case will happen
three days later.

130
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,950
But will it still happen

131
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,830
if Chen Xingjian went missing?

132
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,390
I don't know.

133
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,070
Hold on.

134
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,830
If today is October 4th,

135
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,350
everything

136
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,110
seems to be not right.

137
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,310
You realise this too.

138
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,150
Why would we wake up

139
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,510
in your house?

140
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,310
The last time, I moved in here

141
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,710
on October 24th

142
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,070
after the case of Xu Jingmiao.

143
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,230
It's different now.

144
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,950
What's going on?

145
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,910
Perhaps we're nearing
the finishing point.

146
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,590
Present, past and future

147
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,750
have all met up at some point.

148
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,510
The unknown power has grown stronger

149
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,710
and it has affected people
other than us.

150
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,510
If the universe was affected,

151
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,910
what about Xiaoyu?

152
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,910
Will Xiaoyu...

153
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,310
How come she doesn't answer my call?

154
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,390
Today is October 4th, right?

155
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,990
Don't worry.

156
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,310
Let's go to her house.

157
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,150
Zhu.

158
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,870
What brings you here?

159
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,070
Yu.

160
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,030
What has happened?

161
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,710
Great, Yu.

162
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,670
We just didn't meet for a few days.

163
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,590
Why are you crying so badly?

164
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,750
What has happened?
Tell me.

165
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,430
Yu.

166
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,870
I'm sorry, Yu.

167
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,470
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,910
My mask is going to drop.

169
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,190
It was expensive.

170
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,070
What's wrong?

171
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,870
Come on. Let me see.

172
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,710
What has happened to you?

173
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,550
There, there.

174
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,630
Let me see.

175
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,270
You're ugly.

176
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm so happy

177
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,630
to see you again.

178
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,510
Who's he?

179
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,430
I'm Wu Yu.

180
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,550
Her boyfriend.

181
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,510
Boyfriend?

182
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,230
When did you meet him?

183
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,230
How come I didn't know about this?

184
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,470
Boyfriend.

185
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,150
My goodness.

186
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,750
I hate him.

187
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,890
I'm not wearing make-up now.

188
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,390
I've seen it before.

189
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,070
Yu.

190
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,910
Yu.

191
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,270
Come out.

192
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,630
You're pretty even without make-up.

193
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,550
Also, Yu.

194
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,990
Remember to turn on the application

195
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,790
to share your location with me.

196
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,470
Keep it on.

197
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,630
Do you hear me?

198
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,110
What are you thinking?

199
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,510
Wu Yu.

200
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,270
Since everyone is all alive,

201
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,910
let's make it

202
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,350
a perfect happy ending

203
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,630
this time.

204
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,870
Sure.

205
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,310
Call me if you need any service.

206
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,870
Sure.

207
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,750
Hello.

208
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,310
Xu...

209
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,590
Hello.

210
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,150
How may I help you?

211
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,390
Hello.

212
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,950
I'd like to ask

213
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,990
if there's a lounge singer

214
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,750
named Chen Xingjian here?

215
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,630
Chen Xingjian?

216
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,710
It's been a long time

217
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,870
since he came here last time.

218
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,230
I heard that he went on a trip

219
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,430
and he hasn't returned yet.

220
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,630
Perhaps he has worked in another bar.

221
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,510
Do you want to ask at other bars?

222
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,390
Sure.

223
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,470
Thank you.

224
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,070
Welcome.

225
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,590
Hold on.

226
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,070
Erm...

227
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,550
Please be careful

228
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,350
when you go home at night.

229
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,270
Thank you.

230
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,270
Hello.

231
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,550
How may I help you?

232
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,990
Two beers, please.

233
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,710
Before destiny,

234
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,310
we're so tiny and helpless.

235
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,670
If we can rescue more people this time,

236
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,470
I hope they know nothing about this.

237
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,430
Chen Xingjian has gone missing.

238
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,550
What are we going to do next?

239
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,350
Hello.

240
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,830
Hello, madam.

241
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,910
Yes.

242
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,030
I thought it over

243
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,150
after I returned home that day.

244
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,830
I was too impulsive.

245
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,110
Well.

246
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,630
Can you please ask him out
for me again?

247
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,590
Yes.

248
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,670
I shouldn't be afraid of embarrassment.

249
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,630
What about this?

250
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,910
I'll meet him tomorrow.

251
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,470
Alright.

252
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,270
Bye.

253
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,590
Wu Yu.

254
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,390
I need you

255
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,390
to meet Shen Shiyan on a blind date.

256
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,270
Officer Shen.

257
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,150
Officer Shen.

258
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,270
It's been a while.

259
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,270
Hello.

260
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,990
This is...

261
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,390
He's my boyfriend,

262
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,310
Wu Yu.

263
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,830
Your boyfriend?

264
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,790
Tan Jiao.

265
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,030
What's going on now?

266
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,230
Do you bring your boyfriend here
to intimidate me?

267
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,470
No.

268
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,110
Officer Shen.

269
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,990
Honestly, we came

270
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,350
to discuss something serious

271
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,310
with you.

272
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,670
Lives depend on it.

273
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,950
Officer Shen.

274
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,790
You might find it ridiculous

275
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,150
about the story
you're going to listen to.

276
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,950
I suggest you sit down.

277
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,630
I'm not easily frightened.

278
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,190
This is what's going to happen.

279
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,430
Two days left before the first victim,
Chen Ningmeng

280
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,310
goes missing.

281
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,550
We need the police force

282
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,190
to ensure no accidents will happen.

283
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,070
Are you expecting me

284
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,470
to believe in such an absurd story?

285
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,590
The thing I can only accept is
that he's your boyfriend.

286
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,190
Officer Shen.

287
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,990
You're the best cop I've ever seen.

288
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,270
Although you don't trust us,

289
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,110
however, please consider

290
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,510
the life of your girlfriend

291
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,630
who'll be related to this.

292
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,350
It's safer if you trust us.

293
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,230
Am I right?

294
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,230
I'm single.

295
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,150
No, you're not.

296
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,070
Mister.

297
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,750
Wu Yu.

298
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,030
My name is Wu Yu.

299
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,510
Fine. Wu Yu.

300
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,670
When I'm talking to Tan Jiao,

301
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,270
please don't chip in.

302
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,910
Is that okay?

303
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,670
Would you trust us

304
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,350
if I could foresee your future?

305
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,150
Half an hour later,

306
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,830
please wait at the gate
of Jinghai University.

307
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,190
At that place,

308
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,950
you'll meet your destined partner.

309
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,510
Destined?

310
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,030
Yes.

311
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,670
There's a girl

312
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,950
you've met countless times

313
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,070
and you've fallen for her at first sight
every time.

314
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,190
She'll show up at Jinghai University.

315
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,590
Please go and meet her now.

316
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,550
Who's she?

317
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,870
She's Zhou Xiaoyu.

318
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,590
You'll believe

319
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,950
everything we've told you

320
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,190
once you see her.

321
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,950
I'm off.

322
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,110
Dude.

323
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,150
I've completed my promise to you.

324
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,550
You'll have to do the rest
by yourself.

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,590
Have you met Xiaoyu?

349
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,830
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,590
I've let you down.

I mean,

it ended up Zhou Xiaoyu

asking for my contact.

354
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,070
I knew it.

Shen Shiyan.

How come you always make Xiaoyu

357
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,430
take off her cold mask?

358
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,550
Sit, please.

359
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,350
Officer Shen.

360
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,830
Why did you ask for us
on short notice?

361
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,670
What's the matter?

362
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,710
I have something important

363
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,550
to tell you.

364
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,630
It's Chen Xingjian,
the guy you mentioned last time.

365
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,430
I found him.

366
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,470
- Where's he?
- Where's he?

367
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,510
(Missing)
Chen Xingjian disappeared for two months.

368
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,870
His family called the police

369
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,830
and said he never returns

370
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,070
after he got on

371
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,350
Diamond Star.

372
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,790
So, he's already died.

373
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,030
And that means

374
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,110
the murder case on this timeline

375
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,830
won't happen.

376
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,030
No.

377
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,870
The situation will be worse.

378
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,510
Xu Jingmiao said

379
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,270
Chen Xingjian has another accomplice.

380
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,030
Besides, the accomplice

381
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,310
is most likely the mastermind.

382
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,390
Now that Chen Xingjian has disappeared.

383
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,830
It means that this person

384
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,350
has hidden in the dark again.

385
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,190
However, we're totally clueless

386
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,750
about the murderer's identity and plan.

387
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,030
(Recipe)

388
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,070
Asked me to describe
the cooking process?

389
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,270
I can't even describe this in Mandarin.

390
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,390
Didn't they know

391
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,710
women nowadays
don't engage in a relationship

392
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,790
and cook?

393
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,950
Excuse me, sir.

394
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,950
Your order is ready.

395
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,310
Alright.

396
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,510
You ordered a lot.

397
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,030
We work overnight.

398
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,470
I bought them for my colleagues.

399
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,950
You can get a discount
with my membership.

400
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,070
Thank you.

401
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,910
There are so many coffee shops

402
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,990
in this city,

403
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,510
yet we still meet.

404
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,950
Are you stalking me?

405
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,270
It's out of the question.

406
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,030
Stalking someone

407
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,790
is a violation of one's privacy

408
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,070
and...

409
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,190
Enough. I was joking.

410
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,150
What about

411
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,750
I buy you coffee?

412
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,190
Sure.

413
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,270
Actually, I know

414
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,550
you're a good cop.

415
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,190
So, I'll accept your coffee.

416
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,870
From now on,

417
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,150
we become friends.

418
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,230
Excuse me,

419
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,590
one more Iced Americano, please.

420
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,230
Sure.

421
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,710
Hello. It's 280 yuan in total.

422
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,350
I left my wallet in the car...

423
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,310
It seems

424
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,310
that you owe me something.

425
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,720
(October 5th, 2021)

426
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,710
I wish Xiaoyu and Shen Shiyan

427
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,230
can be safe this time.

428
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,270
No matter how it will end,

429
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,270
at least the two of them can be happy

430
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,710
out of so many people.

431
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,670
I'll be relieved then.

432
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,870
Why are you down in your mouth?

433
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,470
We were brave because we were ignorant.

434
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,790
Previously, we were pushy

435
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,430
and wanted to rescue everyone.

436
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,990
As for now, all details

437
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,510
are laid in front of us.

438
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,190
However,

439
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,070
things become more intricate.

440
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,310
True.

441
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,950
We're hopeless and tiny

442
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,230
when we confront time and space.

443
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,510
Wu Yu.

444
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,430
What if this isn't the end
of that incident,

445
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,270
but ours?

446
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,710
Time has chosen us.

447
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,470
There must be a reason for this choice.

448
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,670
We have 14 days left.

449
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,790
The time is ticking away.

450
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,550
Miao's

451
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,030
and our time.

452
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,070
I really wish to be wilful once

453
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,390
lying on your legs like this

454
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,150
for the rest of the time.

455
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,270
What should we do next?

456
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,510
Chen Xingjian has gone missing

457
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,150
and there's no sign of that person.

458
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,590
According to Xu Jingmiao,

459
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,510
that person is dangerous.

460
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,870
We can't manage to seize him

461
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,350
by only the two of us.

462
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,910
We must seek help from the police.

463
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,310
What about this?

464
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,310
I'll file a report to the police
first thing in the morning.

465
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,470
Even Shen Shiyan
who knew the whole story

466
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,150
found it difficult to trust us,

467
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,510
let alone Ding will build a case

468
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,390
based on your statement.

469
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,790
He'll ask you

470
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,950
how do you manage to foresee cases
that have yet to happen,

471
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,030
your relationship with the victims,

472
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,030
and how you knew about the murderer.

473
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,550
What will you answer then?

474
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,830
Unless...

475
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,990
Unless what?

476
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,710
Nothing.

477
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,470
It doesn't make any sense.

478
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,230
Hello.

479
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,630

Please capture him.

483
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,630
He said he wanted to kill me.

484
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,190
I was almost murdered.

485
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,430
Miss Tan.

486
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,030
Don't be nervous.

487
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,790
Please tell us

488
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,190
what happened yesterday in detail.

489
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,430
Even something

490
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,150
that's insignificant.

491
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,190
Okay.

492
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,390
Yesterday night,

493
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,070
I went to a bar alone

494
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,710
till late at night.

495
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,030
When I was on my way back,

496
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,830
I passed by an alley

497
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,150
and then...

498
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,030
Then,

499
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,870
a guy captured me out of a sudden.

500
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,990
He then brought me

501
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,470
to a house.

502
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,190
There was a table inside.

503
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,870
On the table, there were a syringe

504
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,430
and many bottles of strange potions.

505
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,070
He claimed that he wanted to kill me.

506
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,190
How did you manage to escape then?

507
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,830
I ran away

508
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,950
when he wasn't looking.

509
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,270
Wait.

510
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,070
Apart from those things,

511
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,670
there were a few photos.

512
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,870
Photos?

513
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,670
Yes.

514
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,910
Photos of some girls

515
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,270
with their names on it.

516
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,870
I'm sure

517
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,390
those are the targets

518
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,950
he's going to kill.

519
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,270
I'm sure of this.

520
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,790
The name of the first person

521
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,470
is Chen Ningmeng.

522
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,070
The time will be tomorrow night.

523
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,670
Please capture him as fast as possible

524
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,230
or it'll be late.

525
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,270
Sir.

526
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,270
Excuse me.

527
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,350
I'm Tan Jiao's boyfriend.

528
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,950
May I ask where's she now?

529
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,070
You're the family of the victim, right?

530
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,230
Please stay outside first.

531
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,190
The interrogation is undergoing.

532
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,390
Do you know the captor?

533
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,310
No.

534
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,350
But,

535
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,030
he has a strange voice.

536
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,590
It was like a machine without emotion.

537
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,070
Besides,

538
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,790
he mentioned a name.

539
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,870
It's his accomplice's name, I guess.

540
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,430
Do you remember the name?

541
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,350
It's...

542
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,310
is

543
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,830
Chen Xingjian.

544
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,070
I think this is the name.

545
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,710
But, Chen Xingjian

546
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,070
didn't show up.

547
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,350
Anything else?

548
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,590
Please think carefully.

549
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,510
He has great strength.

550
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,110
I couldn't get rid of him.

551
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,750
He said

552
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,190
he would have me dying in pain

553
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,190
gradually.

554
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,470
Calm down.

555
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,350
Wu Yu.

556
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,470
- What has happened?
- I'm scared.

557
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,350
What has happened?

558
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,670
What has happened?

559
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,670
Mister,

560
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,190
please placate her.

561
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,190
She was shocked by the accident.

562
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,070
Concerning this case,

563
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,710
we need further discussion.

564
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,710
What has happened?

565
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,910
Was it Chen Xingjian?

566
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,830
Not him.

567
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,790
It was me.

568
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,350
Sit. I'll explain to you.

569
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,070
If the police are our last hope,

570
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,190
no one can be more convincing

571
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,670
than a girl who was just escaped

572
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,550
from the evil.

573
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,910
Think about this.

574
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,310
If Chen Ningmeng

575
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,710
isn't the first victim,

576
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,590
but me instead?

577
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,550
- So, I...
- So, you

578
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,910
thought of

579
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,110
a fake yet genuine story.

580
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,550
You pretended to run away

581
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,710
from the murderer

582
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,870
and lied that you saw
his characteristic

583
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,750
and next plan,

584
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,030
then you sought help from the police.

585
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,550
Am I right?

586
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,950
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

587
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,870
I...

588
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,390
I fear that you wouldn't agree with me.

589
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,350
Of course, I wouldn't.

590
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,590
I know I shouldn't have done this.

591
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,790
However, I'm willing
to bear the consequences

592
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,310
to save the others.

593
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,910
What if Ding doesn't trust you

594
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,830
and the police fail
to capture the suspect

595
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,070
and your information is leaked?

596
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,710
You're pushing yourself

597
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,390
towards the culprit.

598
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,830
You'll be in danger.

599
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,150
You're always by my side anyway.

600
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,110
I'll be fine.

601
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,910
Besides,

602
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,310
we're going back

603
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,830
to the cave 13 days later.

604
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,270
Alright.

605
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,710
Stop worrying.

606
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,870
You've told me

607
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,030
that everything will gather

608
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,750
and end there.

609
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,990
I believe in you.

610
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,190
Babe.

611
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,670
Babe.

612
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,790
Babe.

613
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,030
Miao.

614
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,830
Babe.

615
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,670
What brings you here?

616
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,670
My favourite band is coming to Jinghai.

617
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,510
Seriously?

618
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,630
What...what's the band's name?

619
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,750
It's a niche band

620
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,510
and it's a rare chance
to have them performing in Jinghai.

621
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,150
Today, we must

622
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,150
snap the tickets up.

623
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,630
What should I do?

624
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,390
This one.

625
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,390
(Nineteen Bar, Renmin Road, District Kaifu, Jinghai City.)
Use this application.

626
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,190
Nineteen.

627
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,670
It's a bar in the Old Town.

628
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,350
- Is it this one?
- Yes, it's.

629
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,350
Yes, this one.

630
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,910
Got it.

631
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,150
Set a reminder.

632
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,910
I'll set a reminder.

633
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,030
Yes.

634
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,390
Is the network here fast?

635
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,270
No problem.

636
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,110
Are you sure?

637
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,190
Yes. Don't worry.

638
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,270
I'll get the ticket for you.

639
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,030
Tan Jiao.

640
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,710
Captain Ding.

641
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,670
We failed to find the taxi driver.

642
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,870
That Chen Xingjian you mentioned

643
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,230
has disappeared for a long time.

644
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,830
His family said he went on a trip

645
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,870
and he never returned.

646
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,350
Two out of the girls you said

647
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,470
matched the information in our hands.

648
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,470
However, it proves nothing.

649
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,750
Miss Tan.

650
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,030
You're smart people.

651
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,390
Your statement is precise

652
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,870
and it seems real.

653
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,710
However, it's too perfect.

654
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,230
Everything seems to be seamless.

655
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,990
You just got kidnapped

656
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,390
after a few days you reached Jinghai.

657
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,710
You remembered the characteristic
of the suspect

658
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,950
and spotted his plan,

659
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,950
also, you managed to escape from him.

660
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,950
I knew you were lying.

661
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,430
So, I wouldn't put my men at risk
to keep a watch out

662
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,350
for the suspect.

663
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,510
Concerning your case is less serious

664
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,830
and doesn't cause any trouble.

665
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,150
Go and pay the fine.

666
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,280
=My Deepest Dream=

667
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,750
Hello, sir.

668
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,710
This is the menu.

669
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,710
Please have a look.

670
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,230
Thank you.

671
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,990
Sure, thank you.

672
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,150
Order any food you like.

673
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,510
It's on me.

674
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,510
I'm a big eater.

675
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,390
Are't you afraid that I rip you off?

676
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,710
You like spicy food, right?

677
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,950
This restaurant serves
delicious Sichuan cuisine.

678
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,630
How do you know I like spicy food?

679
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,790
Don't tell me you're my fan.

680
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,990
I see.

681
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,270
I do have many fans.

682
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,270
I'm not your fan.

683
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,390
I'm a cop.

684
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,270
What?

685
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,830
I'm a cop.

686
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,630
Did I do anything wrong?

687
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,310
I'm a common university student,

688
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,270
a good citizen.

689
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,470
No.

690
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,790
Are you really a cop?

691
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,630
I can show you
my police identification card.

692
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,110
Look.

693
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,150
Well.

694
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,230
No need.

695
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,150
Mr. Cop.

696
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,470
We hit it off right.

697
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,590
Can you please do me a favour?

698
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,510
Well.

699
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,670
I'm a writer.

700
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,830
Recently,

701
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,030
I'm preparing a new story
about the cops.

702
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,830
Can you please give me some inspiration?

703
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,110
But,

704
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,990
we aren't allowed

705
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,830
to disclose the information

706
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,830
of our cases.

707
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,430
I'm not interested in that.

708
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,270
You're indeed staid.

709
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,510
What's your height?

710
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,510
1.83 m.

711
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,590
1.83 m?

712
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,710
Weight.

713
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,910
70 kg.

714
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,270
Age.

715
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,630
26.

716
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,430
I can't believe that.

717
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,790
I can show you my identification card.

718
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,830
I trust you.

719
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,150
There's no need to show me that.

720
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,150
Alright.

721
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,230
You're 26 year-old.

722
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,110
What's your hobby?

723
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,510
My hobby?

724
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:36,990
I…

725
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,710
I don't have any hobbies.

726
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,470
You have no hobby?

727
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,070
That's impossible.

728
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,910
Perhaps I'm occupied with work.

729
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,630
Seriously?

730
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,470
Is this an interrogation?

731
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,870
No, it's not.

732
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,030
I don't have the guts.

733
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,350
I just want to learn more about cops.

734
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,830
After all, you'll be the male lead
who's attractive to women

735
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,630
in my future story.

736
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,030
However, you only like the female lead.

737
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,670
Both of you meet
because of a missing person case.

738
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,270
Due to the quantum entanglement
function,

739
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,310
you meet in different lives
again and again.

740
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,070
And you end up being together
after repeated reunions.

741
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,750
What do you think of it?

742
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,710
Are you moved by this plot?

743
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,190
It sounds like science fiction.

744
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,750
Science fiction has been
the hottest trend these days.

745
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,990
I'll recommend you another book.

746
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,430
Evolution of the Planets.

747
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,310
Planets?

748
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:23,990
Let me check.

749
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,870
The writer is Zhuang Yu.

750
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,030
It's me.

751
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,230
Alright, last question.

752
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,470
What's your favourite food?

753
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,550
Chocolate.

754
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,870
Chocolate?

755
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,510
You don't seem like someone
who eats chocolate though.

756
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,550
It's hard to believe that a guy
likes sweet food.

757
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,110
I don't really like sweet food.

758
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,350
It just came to my mind on a whim.

759
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,350
How fortuitous.

760
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,670
My favourite is chocolate.

761
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,270
I'll add two more chocolate cakes.

762
00:40:59,350 --> 00:40:59,790
Done.

763
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,470
Waitress.

764
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,030
This is my order.

765
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,070
Thank you.

766
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:11,830
Please excuse me.

767
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,470
Hello.

768
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:18,870
Got it.

769
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,430
Why?

770
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,630
You need to go now?

771
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,390
I have urgent work to deal with.

772
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,110
Off you go.

773
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,310
Let's meet up next time.

774
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,190
Sure.

775
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,510
I don't know
your address, contact number,

776
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,310
which year you're studying,

777
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,150
and your major.

778
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,270
Mr. Cop.

779
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,870
Are you a criminal police officer

780
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,510
or a census officer?

781
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,190
I'm sorry.

782
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,470
I just want to confirm

783
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,030
if I can find you

784
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,510
next time.

785
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,190
Let's exchange our contact numbers.

786
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,830
Sure.

787
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,190
I won't forget

788
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,310
that you owe me a meal.

789
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,310
Zhou Xiaoyu.

790
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:16,870
