00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,063
Have you come out

344
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,823
with a specific plan

345
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:55,063
after we arrive at Jinghai?

346
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:56,662
Do you know what's the greatest weapon

347
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:57,463
we have in our hands?

348
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:00,862
Time.

349
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:03,783
We're the only people in this world

350
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:05,823
who knows the murderer's plan.

351
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:08,743
In this timeline,

352
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:10,622
the murderer has already
killed three girls.

353
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,543
The next target is Xu Jingmiao.

354
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,182
What we have to do

355
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,303
is to catch the murderer
before he makes any move.

356
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,120
(Xu Jingmiao was killed
between October 24th to 27th)

357
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:21,743
Xu Jingmiao was killed

358
00:18:21,743 --> 00:18:22,622
between October 24th

359
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:23,703
to 27th.

360
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,142
She was working

361
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:26,823
in a 24-hours bar.

362
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,102
The time she was killed is
when she returned from work alone

363
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,142
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.

364
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,422
She was last seen on camera

365
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:35,622
at midnight on the 24th

366
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,303
where the place wasn't far
from her workplace.

367
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:39,023
In the early morning of the 27th,

368
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:40,023
a jogging man

369
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,503
discovered her body

370
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,503
near the trash can
in the west of the city.

371
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,102
It means

372
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:47,823
that there were three days
between her disappearance

373
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,543
and the discovery of her death,

374
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,142
but we couldn't know

375
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:52,703
where the murder scene is.

376
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,063
However, we're sure

377
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,543
that the murderer has taken her

378
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:56,783
by the 24th.

379
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,422
I was planning to look for her
on her campus tomorrow.

380
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:05,182
Thank you.

381
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,000
(Xu Jingmiao)

382
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:34,902
Are you really not coming home with me?

383
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,662
I asked Miao to wait for us at home.

384
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,862
You must have many things
to talk to her

385
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,342
when you meet her.

386
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,342
I won't disturb you then.

387
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:43,823
I'll go to Yu's house first.

388
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,102
And we'll look for Xu Jingmiao tomorrow.

389
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:48,942
Well.

390
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:50,382
Take care.

391
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:52,182
I'm off then.

392
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:53,142
Go ahead.

393
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:18,063
Your life-saver chocolate is here.

394
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:19,902
A box of chocolate for a sweet girl

395
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,662
who's always at your service.

396
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:23,342
Please receive your parcel.

397
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,862
What brings you here,

398
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,342
Dazhu?

399
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:28,902
Because I miss you.

400
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:30,422
I miss you so much.

401
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:33,622
Why didn't you inform me
before you come?

402
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:35,342
You like surprises, don't you?

403
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:44,942
This is it.

404
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,823
I'll write you an address later.

405
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:50,422
It's the address of
an abandoned warehouse

406
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:52,382
with a basement underground.

407
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,182
You must

408
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,662
bring this to the warehouse

409
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:57,063
before January next year.

410
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:00,182
What's this?

411
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,063
Something that can save lives.

412
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,902
Is it important?

413
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:06,102
It's very important

414
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,023
as if

415
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:08,942
you fail to deliver it there,

416
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:11,182
Wu Yu and I will die.

417
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,422
Who's Wu Yu?

418
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:14,743
Is it your boyfriend?

419
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:17,582
Come clean.

420
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,783
When do you have a boyfriend?

421
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:21,622
You were single

422
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,662
before the cruise trip though.

423
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:26,263
Well.

424
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,743
This is a long long story.

425
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,783
Are you sure you want to listen?

426
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:39,662
Miao.

427
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,142
I'm home.

428
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:43,422
Miao.

429
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:48,422
Miao.

430
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:51,743
Miao.

431
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,543
I knew there'd be a traffic jam.

432
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,223
My brother is back soon.

433
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,662
He's really weird lately

434
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,023
as he keeps a very close eye on me.

435
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:14,902
But

436
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,622
why did you come out today then?

437
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,942
He can't guard me for 24 hours.

438
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:19,862
I went out

439
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:20,902
once he was gone.

440
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:23,743
Isn't this his bag?

441
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:27,422
Wu Yu.

442
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:28,662
Wu Yu.

443
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:29,902
You're back.

444
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:33,063
It's Zhu Yutong. Do you remember him?

445
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,142
We met him on the cruise.

446
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:36,023
Wu Yu.

447
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:37,862
I asked you to stay at home.

448
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,102
Why did you hang out?

449
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:39,862
Wu Yu.

450
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:40,662
You just told me

451
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:42,182
not to go out on November 5th,

452
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,823
not before.

453
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:49,783
(Rock band)
Bar? Band?

454
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:51,063
Have you finished your exam?

455
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:53,503
I haven't been there before.

456
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:54,182
It's next week.

457
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:55,942
This is my favourite band.

458
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:56,422
I'm going...

459
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:58,902
Stay at home to prepare for the exam
next week.

460
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,382
After that, memorise English vocabulary

461
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:01,983
and prepare for College English Test-6.

462
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:03,142
CET-6?

463
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,783
Wu Yu, I just finished CET-4.

464
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:07,703
Why do you stop me from going out?

465
00:23:08,063 --> 00:23:08,743
I'm telling you

466
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:09,783
I've waited for this band
for half a year.

467
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:10,503
I want to go.

468
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:11,182
I will.

469
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:11,743
Wu Miao!

470
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:16,182
Brother...

471
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:19,942
Wu Yu.

472
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:23,503
I told her

473
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:24,983
about the bar and the band.

474
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,342
Please don't blame Miao.

475
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:29,303
I...

476
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:30,902
I won't bother you here anymore.

477
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:32,503
I'll leave first.

478
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:51,743
I'm sorry.

479
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,942
Wu Yu, what has happened?

480
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,142
Is something bothering you?

481
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:10,582
Where's Master Qizhu?

482
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,102
I thought she was coming home with you.

483
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:13,862
Where's she?

484
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:17,182
We're talking about you.

485
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:18,182
Don't change the subject.

486
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:19,703
Did you

487
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:21,503
fight?

488
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:24,422
Or did you break up with her?

489
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:26,983
It can't be, right?

490
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,063
Seriously?

491
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:30,783
No wonder you act so weirdly.

492
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,422
Wu Yu.

493
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:34,743
If you're depressed now

494
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:35,942
and want me to stay with you,

495
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,622
just tell me straight away.

496
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,023
Don't need to find excuses.

497
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:45,182
If

498
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,303
I really broke up with her,

499
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:48,223
are you willing to stay at home with me?

500
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:49,422
Of course.

501
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:51,823
You need me the most now.

502
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:54,063
I'll stick by your side.

503
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:07,063
Yu.

504
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:11,862
How come your reaction

505
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:14,902
is so much different
from the previous two times?

506
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:15,983
Certainly.

507
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,703
The time moves forwards every time.

508
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:20,543
Therefore, I am less able
to handle stress

509
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:22,543
as I'm younger now.

510
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:26,063
You've suffered so much.

511
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:29,862
It's you who suffered the most.

512
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,823
You've travelled across time
and been through so much

513
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:35,662
as well as taking the heavy role
as an oracle.

514
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:37,303
Yu.

515
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,382
Speaking of the scenes I saw,

516
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:40,263
do you think

517
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:42,342
they will become reality?

518
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,422
Perhaps the moments

519
00:25:44,422 --> 00:25:45,823
that will happen in certain universes.

520
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:47,582
Great.

521
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:51,382
If they are real,

522
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,303
we can catch

523
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,463
the murderer very soon.

524
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,662
But the murderer sounds
really dangerous.

525
00:25:57,983 --> 00:25:58,942
Can both of you make it?

526
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,463
I believe Wu Yu

527
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,102
will catch the murderer for sure.

528
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:04,303
He's great.

529
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,382
I've smelt of something.

530
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,983
It's the sour smell of love.

531
00:26:11,223 --> 00:26:12,303
Didn't you

532
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,463
have a blind date
with an police officer?

533
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:16,422
Since you have a boyfriend now,

534
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:17,303
what about him?

535
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:19,743
No worries.

536
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:21,023
Before long,

537
00:26:21,743 --> 00:26:23,622
someone will get him.

538
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:29,662
I've passed the first aid box
to Zhuang Yu.

539
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,142
Don't worry. See you tomorrow.

540
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:37,503
Wu Yu.

541
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,182
Are you alright?

542
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,422
I've seen you like this before.

543
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:46,142
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

544
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:47,303
You have an exam tomorrow.

545
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:50,102
I'll follow you to the campus tomorrow.

546
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:52,182
No need. I can go by myself.

547
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:57,823
I

548
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:01,263
don't want to stay at home alone.

549
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:02,263
Alright.

550
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,743
You drive me there.

551
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:05,503
I'll come back home
right after the exam.

552
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:08,662
I'm going to sleep now.

553
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:10,382
Don't be sad.

554
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:13,263
Come to me if you're not fine.

555
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,422
Change of plans.

556
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:28,743
Why?

557
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,942
Wu Yu broke up with his girlfriend.

558
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:33,743
I have to spend time with him.

559
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,023
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

560
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:37,102
I'm off to bed.

561
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:37,862
Good night.

562
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:49,382
Stop waiting.

563
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,582
I'm sure he has slept.

564
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:53,983
Why did you know that?

565
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:55,582
Of course, I know.

566
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:04,342
Come clean.

567
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,223
Which base are you in now?

568
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:09,743
What?

569
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,942
What do you mean by base?

570
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,382
No dirty talk.

571
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:15,823
I can't understand that.

572
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:18,743
The way I see it,

573
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:20,743
you've been together

574
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:22,382
just for a month.

575
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:24,622
And you've been through many obstacles
before.

576
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:26,582
You're a timid one

577
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,023
while he's smouldering.

578
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:31,182
I guess you haven't...

579
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,342
No.

580
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:32,983
Nothing has happened.

581
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:34,422
Cut your crap.

582
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:37,102
No dirty talk.

583
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:37,823
Geez.

584
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:38,582
Didn't you say

585
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:40,142
you planned to capture the murderer?

586
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:42,942
Why not make another plan

587
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:44,983
to make Mr. Wu your husband
by the way?

588
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,503
Nonsense.

589
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:48,662
We love each other deeply.

590
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:50,543
We're not that anxious and
have a long way to go.

591
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,783
The time we spend together

592
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:54,703
is the most important thing in dating.

593
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:55,662
Tush!

594
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:57,382
You just don't have the guts.

595
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:58,263
You're timid.

596
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,503
Anyway, I'm in a love relationship now

597
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:04,303
and my boyfriend is very handsome.

598
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:06,063
Unlike someone who's still single.

599
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:09,662
Tan Jiao.

600
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:11,783
How bold of you.

601
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,182
I tell you what,

602
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,622
I'll get a boyfriend tomorrow.

603
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:15,902
A man with eight-pack abs.

604
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,582
Speaking of your boyfriend,

605
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:19,823
I knew

606
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,063
something about him.

607
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:22,543
Are you curious?

608
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:23,902
Don't tell me.

609
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,342
I want to experience this by myself.

610
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:26,862
Understand?

611
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:29,342
But,

612
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:32,743
does he have eight-pack abs?

613
00:29:35,582 --> 00:29:37,422
How would I know

614
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:38,823
if your boyfriend has that?

615
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:41,382
I only know

616
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,023
my Wu Yu has eight-pack abs.

617
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,942
Let me check do you have that.

618
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:47,703
How dare you make fun of me.

619
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,662
Stop it.

620
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,463
I'm ticklish.

621
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:50,783
- Let me check.
- No, Zhuang Yu.

622
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:08,102
Wu Yu, you can leave now.

623
00:30:08,382 --> 00:30:09,703
I'll come back home after the exam.

624
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:11,263
I'm leaving.

625
00:30:16,503 --> 00:30:17,662
Leave now.

626
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,983
Leave the parcel at the doorstep.

627
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:47,703
You go.

628
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:49,422
Go.

629
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,662
Go now.

630
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:54,983
I've told you

631
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,862
to leave the parcel at the doorstep.

632
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:01,382
Hello, Zhou Xiaoyu.

633
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:02,622
I came here for Tan Jiao.

634
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:04,862
Who are you?

635
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:06,063
I'm Wu Yu.

636
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:07,182
But,

637
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:08,862
you prefer to call me 'the male lead'.

638
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:10,382
The male lead?

639
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:15,983
Tan Jiao, get up now.

640
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:17,382
I hate your boyfriend.

641
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:18,582
I'm not wearing makeup now.

642
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:22,862
Wu Yu.

643
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:24,743
What brings you here?

644
00:31:24,942 --> 00:31:25,902
I have something to tell you.

645
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:28,703
Come in.

646
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,783
No need to change your shoes.
Just come in

647
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:33,263
I'll tell you while we're eating.

648
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:36,422
Sit.

649
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:38,823
Leave it there.

650
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:48,902
You bought a lot.

651
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,622
I have no idea what you like to eat.

652
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:51,582
So, I bought all.

653
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:04,342
I'm blind now.

654
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:07,263
Well, I won't hurt you now.

655
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:11,422
Why do you dress

656
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:12,783
like an agent?

657
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:14,862
Of course,

658
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:16,142
it's because of you.

659
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:17,422
Thank you.

660
00:32:18,422 --> 00:32:19,263
I'm off.

661
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,182
Bye-bye.

662
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,102
Go, Dear Yu.

663
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:23,743
Bye-bye.

664
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:27,223
Did you find anything new?

665
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:28,622
I want to tell you

666
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:29,783
that something has changed.

667
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:31,862
I went to the campus
to look for Xu Jingmiao.

668
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,182
Students from the department have
internship training this semester

669
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:36,182
and their lecture has already finished.

670
00:32:36,463 --> 00:32:38,543
Xu Jingmiao is a local student

671
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:39,743
and she doesn't often stay at the dorm.

672
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:41,342
You can contact her

673
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:42,543
by phone.

674
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:45,142
Sure, thank you.

675
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,382
She's not on campus.

676
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:49,543
Therefore,

677
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,743
I'm thinking to check her out
at the bar where she works.

678
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,862
What time did you go to bed last night?

679
00:33:04,823 --> 00:33:05,422
Not too late.

680
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:06,942
What time was it?

681
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:11,902
Promise me.

682
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:14,303
You must take enough rest

683
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:15,382
and stop staying up late again.

684
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:25,662
I'm fine as long as you're with me.

685
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:28,303
Well.

686
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,342
Take a nap.

687
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:34,582
Tan Jiao.

688
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,703
Finally, life presents me with a sweet.

689
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:45,063
Hopefully, our future

690
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:47,743
is full of sweetness.

691
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,263
I'll sleep for five minutes.

692
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,142
See you later.

693
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,622
Alright.

694
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,063
Sleep now.

695
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,862
Didn't I tell you I'd only sleep
for five minutes?

696
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,462
You were sleeping soundly.

697
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:17,303
And I hate to wake you up.

698
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:23,183
I think

699
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:25,103
the God of Fortunate will favour us
this time.

700
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,583
Perhaps as we are walking,

701
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:28,342
we'll run into Xu Jingmiao

702
00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:29,623
on the way.

703
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:30,783
Stop recording. Delete it.

704
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:32,422
Let go of me. Give me my phone.

705
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:33,022
Stop recording.

706
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:33,462
No.

707
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:35,703
Don't take my phone.

708
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:37,743
Let go.

709
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:38,542
You can talk it out

710
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,223
instead of fighting.

711
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:40,502
Ask her to delete the video.

712
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,382
I won't.

713
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:43,103
I'll publish it on the website

714
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:44,542
to show others your true colour.

715
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:45,703
Fine.

716
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,462
Madwoman.

717
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,022
You're mad instead.

718
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,183
How could you be rude to a woman
in broad daylight?

719
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:53,783
Thank you so much.

720
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:55,422
Don't mention it.

721
00:34:56,223 --> 00:34:56,982
You're a girl

722
00:34:56,982 --> 00:34:58,342
and must be careful.

723
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:00,022
It's dangerous to fight like this.

724
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,022
Fret not. I've recorded it.

725
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,263
If he dares to beat me,

726
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:04,422
the police will capture him.

727
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,263
I'd like to thank you anyway.

728
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:08,902
My name is Xu Jingmiao.

729
00:35:09,223 --> 00:35:09,862
What's your name?

730
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,103
Xu...

731
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:15,223
You're Xu Jingmiao?

732
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:18,462
Hello, I'm Tan Jiao.

733
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:19,502
Hello.

734
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:22,022
I work at Nineteen every night.

735
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:22,862
If possible,

736
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,183
drop by there with your boyfriend.

737
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:26,263
Nineteen?

738
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:28,223
Is this the famous bar?

739
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:31,823
Can we come tonight?

740
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:32,862
No problem.

741
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:34,022
Say my name.

742
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:34,982
I'll buy your drinks.

743
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:36,382
Sure.

744
00:35:36,823 --> 00:35:37,663
I'll get going then.

745
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:38,902
Bye-bye.

746
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:42,982
I've told you the God of Fortune

747
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:44,263
would favour us, right?

748
00:35:45,022 --> 00:35:45,623
Wu Yu.

749
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:46,862
This time,

750
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:48,902
we'll definitely catch him.
