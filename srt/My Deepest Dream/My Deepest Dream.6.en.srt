we just received news about Zihan.

Miss Zhu,

18
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:46,173
did you go

19
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:47,533
on a cruise

20
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:48,813
on Diamond Star last year?

21
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:50,653
How did you know?

22
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,013
Yan Yuan and I met

23
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,052
on that cruise ship.

24
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,253
You were on that cruise too?

25
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:01,173
Yes.

26
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,973
Do you still remember
what happened on the cruise?

27
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:05,212
Of course, we do.

28
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,732
I met Yan Yuan the next day

29
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,213
after I boarded the cruise.

30
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:12,572
Then...

31
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:17,933
After that...

32
00:02:26,373 --> 00:02:27,572
What's wrong with me?

33
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,132
I... I should remember all that.

34
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,213
The memories I had
on the cruise are obviously still vivid.

35
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:36,292
But why can't

36
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:38,973
we recall anything?

37
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,933
What's going on?

38
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,612
Why are you asking us these?

39
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,452
What exactly happened
on the cruise ship?

40
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:47,572
I want to know

41
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:48,892
what happened too.

42
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,773
But I'm in a similar situation as you.

43
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:53,732
I don't remember anything.

44
00:02:59,333 --> 00:02:59,973
It's okay.

45
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,692
If you remember anything,

46
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:03,773
you can call me anytime.

47
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:04,692
Sure.

48
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,612
Do you recall the bird on the cruise?

49
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:09,773
No.

50
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,132
It seems the passengers of the cruise

51
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,253
have lost their memories.

52
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,852
They're not an exception either.

53
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:24,533
So the clues of my memory loss

54
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:25,852
are all gone now.

55
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,333
That also proves

56
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,493
this cruise ship is suspicious.

57
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:30,253
But since it's suspicious,

58
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:31,773
we can find a way to solve it.

59
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,132
I won't be going in with you.

60
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:44,692
All right, then.

Wash my car.

Didn't you just wash it?

00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:24,773
See?

134
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:26,612
It's dirty again.

00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:33,252
All done and it's free of charge.

136
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,012
He's not at the hostel.

137
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:40,892
I'm not here to see him.

138
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,612
He didn't come to work today either.

139
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,053
Where did he go?

140
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,413
I knew you were here to see him.

141
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:48,372
I have no idea where he is either.

142
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:49,732
I wanted to ask you to find him.

143
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:52,293
What do you mean?

144
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,252
I'm Wu Yu classmate in junior high.

145
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:58,333
I'm sure you know
what happened to his family, right?

146
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,453
Do you mean Wu Miao?

147
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:06,732
It was too tragic.

148
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:08,093
It's almost one year.

149
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,413
But there's no clue at all.

150
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,532
He came to Dali
because he couldn't let it go.

151
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:13,093
The police said

152
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,132
the killer's car had a spare part made

153
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:16,532
by a manufacturer here.

154
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,813
That's why he came here to try his luck.

155
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:20,652
So did he find it?

156
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:24,252
We managed to talk to the dealers.

157
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,213
But they said

158
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,453
that batch of spare parts was destroyed

159
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,892
because of poor quality.

160
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,532
When I was a kid,

161
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,293
I like sitting alone here.

162
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,933
What did you do sitting here?

163
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:05,453
I'd let my mind drift away.

164
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,693
When I look at the calm lake,

165
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,012
I can feel

166
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:11,372
my heart feeling calm.

167
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,053
It was as though...

168
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:18,173
It's as if there are no obstacles

169
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:19,973
that I can't overcome.

170
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,053
When certain things happened,

171
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,652
they can never be the same again.

172
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:29,012
I'm saddened

173
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:32,173
by this matter too.

174
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:35,093
But...

175
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:39,652
But you can't torment
yourself like this.

176
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,333
I've told you

177
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,012
that my eyesight improved
extraordinarily

178
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,772
after I got off the cruise.

179
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,612
I could see everything clearly

180
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,813
within 10km.

181
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:01,813
But this ability

182
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,453
is a curse to me.

183
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:07,813
Because

184
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:11,053
the first person who found Miao was me.

185
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,492
Yet, I couldn't find her killer

186
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,973
within that range.

187
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:21,813
At that time,

188
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:24,732
I felt helpless

189
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,053
and useless.

190
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,532
Yu once told me a theory.

191
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:42,413
She said

192
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:44,772
there are many parallel universes.

193
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:49,852
Do you think

194
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:54,012
there many "us" living
in these parallel universes?

195
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:55,813
Let me put it this way.

196
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:58,173
In this parallel universe,

197
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,213
we know each other.

198
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:02,132
But in another parallel universe,

199
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:03,612
we're just strangers.

200
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:05,372
Another example,

201
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,492
is I'm a novelist

202
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,453
in this parallel universe.

203
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:13,372
But in another parallel universe,

204
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:16,732
I'm a soldier with a gun
on the battlefield.

205
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:23,173
Say.

206
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,053
Why do parallel universes exist?

207
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,132
I guess it's quantum uncertainty.

208
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:40,732
I don't really know all these.

209
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:42,772
But I do believe

210
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:45,252
there's another us

211
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,093
who are happy

212
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,892
deep in the universe.

213
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,252
And we can feel

214
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,293
this happiness

215
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:55,413
across the universe.

216
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,852
This is also the reason

217
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,652
we suddenly feel happy

218
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,453
sometimes.

219
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,492
We may have lost someone

220
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,732
and missed out on things here.

221
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:17,413
But there must be many possibilities

222
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:19,852
and happy endings

223
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,973
in other parallel universes.

224
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,413
I think that should be why

225
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:25,693
the parallel universe exists.

226
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:31,693
Why?

227
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:33,573
Don't you believe me?

228
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,892
I don't usually think that way.

229
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:42,213
Then try it out.

230
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,093
Close your eyes.

231
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,413
Close your eyes like me

232
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,293
and feel

233
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,693
the other you living
in another parallel universe.

234
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,492
What would that other you who are happy

235
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:58,093
would tell you right now?

236
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:51,772
Thank you.

237
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:56,732
How do you plan to thank me?

238
00:14:58,813 --> 00:14:59,693
Next time,

239
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,732
I'll take you to watch
a firework display.

240
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:04,252
It's a promise, then.

241
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:05,693
Let's do a pinky swear.

242
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:12,732
(Police)
Captain Shen,

243
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,573
the doctor from the hospital called.

244
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,693
He said it was too late
to rescue Zhu Boyan

245
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:16,852
so he died from massive blood loss.

246
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,252
He's dead?

247
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:23,132
Why are you here?

248
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:24,492
I'm here to return the car to you.

249
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:26,892
So

250
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,693
Zhu Boyan had died?

251
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:30,973
How did you know?

252
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,132
If you're free,

253
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,213
you can go upstairs

254
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:34,333
and report this to Captain Ding.

255
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:36,532
I was on my way
to see Captain Ding actually.

256
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:41,372
Miss Zhou.

257
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:42,252
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,012
The case is still under investigation.

259
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,093
So I can't disclose

260
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:46,173
too many details.

261
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:46,852
Sorry about that.

262
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,813
I know you're following the procedure.

263
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:51,652
But I'm also

264
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,372
a detective fiction novelist.

265
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:54,492
You should let me contribute to creating

266
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:55,453
a peaceful society.

267
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,732
(Orphan)
So this is Zhu Boyan.

268
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:02,333
Miss Zhou,

269
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:03,492
I'm truly sorry.

270
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:04,372
I really can't disclose

271
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:05,892
too many details of the case.

272
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,132
Why do you repeat the same thing?

273
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:07,852
Just wait.

274
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:09,573
Don't you find Zhu Boyan looks different

275
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:11,413
from the rest of the Zhu family?

276
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:16,612
According to your report,

277
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:17,813
Zhu Boyan suffered

278
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,173
from congenital heart disease.

279
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:20,852
But the autopsy

280
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:22,532
didn't show he had one.

281
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:26,372
Are you certain
that this Zhu Boyan doesn't have

282
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,293
congenital heart disease?

283
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,453
Yes, I'm certain.

284
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:32,372
It's Shen Shiyan.

285
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:33,413
Let me take this call.

286
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:35,973
Yes, Shen Shiyan.

287
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:46,693
Okay.

288
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,093
It wasn't Zhu Boyan

289
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,053
that was caught, right?

290
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,093
The DNA results came out.

291
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,612
His real name was Xu Zifeng.

292
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:56,333
He was the other child

293
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,852
who disappeared more than 20 years ago.

294
00:16:58,413 --> 00:16:59,973
Do you remember the day we were attacked

295
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:01,173
by a group of strange birds
in the warehouse?

296
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:02,933
But only Yan Yuan
and Zhu Jirui were fine.

297
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,732
Do you recall the bird?

298
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:12,973
No.

299
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:14,693
I asked

300
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:15,973
if they saw the bird.

301
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,893
There are different types of birds
on the cruise.

302
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:20,292
Any average person would ask

303
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,572
even if they don't know.

304
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:22,893
But they said no without thinking

305
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:23,772
about it.

306
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,052
They're hiding something.

307
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,052
They've boarded Diamond Star,

308
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,413
and those birds appeared
on the cruise ship too.

309
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,332
Yan Yuan may be the real Zhu Boyan.

310
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:36,893
So I think Xu Zifeng and Yan Yuan

311
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:38,133
know each other.

312
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:39,092
That day,

313
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:41,173
he was obviously seeking justice
for Zhu Boyan.

314
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,580
(Construction Area. Keep Out)

315
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:50,572
Help! Help!

316
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,052
Is anyone here?

317
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,453
Help me! Please help me!

318
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:02,613
Help!

319
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:04,613
Help me! Help!

320
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:08,613
Help!

321
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:16,732
Yan Yuan,

322
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:17,933
help me.

323
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:23,332
Do you know

324
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:24,453
why I brought you here,

325
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:27,693
Zhu Chunsheng?

326
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,812
You don't even recognize your son.

327
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,173
Do you know what kind of life I had

328
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:40,853
after you abandoned me?

329
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:44,613
After the human traffickers
took me away,

330
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,012
they made me steal
in the street every day.

331
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,732
They'd beat me up
if I fail to steal anything.

332
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:55,453
Can you guess

333
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,572
what I wished most at the time?

334
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,173
I wish I could die
from my illness faster.

335
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,292
But I didn't expect

336
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:13,332
to be completely healed.

337
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:15,572
Impossible.

338
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:16,812
That's impossible.

339
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,732
They said you wouldn't live long.

340
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,693
I didn't want to watch you die

341
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,092
so

342
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:22,732
I left you there.

343
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:23,453
But

344
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,373
when I returned the next day,

345
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,492
you were already gone.

346
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,052
I wasn't dead when I appeared
in front of you.

347
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:34,653
I thought you wouldn't abandon me

348
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,052
when I'm already healed.

349
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:38,453
But do you still remember this place?

350
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:40,012
It wasn't easy for me

351
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,933
from the human traffickers.

352
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:51,732
I ran to this amusement.

353
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,133
I waited for you every day.

354
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,532
Finally,

355
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,292
you appeared.

356
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,092
Dad!

357
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:08,853
Let me go.

358
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,613
Dad! Dad!

359
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:12,373
Let go!

360
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,973
(Candied fruits!)

361
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:16,453
Dad,

362
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,413
I'm Boyan!

363
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:31,012
You recognized me at the time.

364
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:33,812
But I don't understand

365
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,532
why you did you choose
to abandon me again.

366
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,653
I didn't understand

367
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:05,133
why you didn't want me at first.

368
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:07,092
It was until I saw the news.

369
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:09,532
You've changed your appearance.

370
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:11,613
You flattered a wealthy businessman

371
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:12,772
and became his son-in-law.

372
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,213
You even changed your name.

373
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,812
No wonder you won't acknowledge me.

374
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:18,532
No,

375
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:20,173
it wasn't like that.

376
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,092
After you went missing,

377
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,653
I spent money to find you.

378
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:26,572
But the investigator told me

379
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:27,732
that you were dead.

380
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:28,933
That's why I...

381
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:32,653
Listen to me.

382
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:35,812
After that,

383
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:38,812
I went to the orphanage

384
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:41,812
and know Zifeng.

385
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,613
We helped each other
to set up a business.

386
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,292
I thought...

387
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,732
I thought

388
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:51,613
I'll never have anything to do
with you again.

389
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,893
But that was before I met Rui

390
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:58,693
on Diamond Star.

391
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:02,732
Isn't it a waste

392
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:04,893
for a beautiful lady like you
to work at a bank?

393
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:06,453
I thought you were an actress.

394
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,973
You're exaggerating.

395
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,092
I need to go to the washroom.

396
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,012
Give me a new one.

397
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:41,613
You finished your drink.

398
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:42,853
So I ordered another one for you.

399
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:44,133
Thank you.

400
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:45,613
Cheers.

401
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:46,853
Cheers.

402
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:48,173
Don't drink it.

403
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:52,133
He spiked your drink.

404
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:56,492
If you harass her again,

405
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:58,133
I won't show you mercy.

406
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:11,893
Thank you very much.

407
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,853
Hi, I'm Yan Yuan.

408
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,373
I'm Zhu Jirui.

409
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:25,252
Rui is the most lovable
and kindest person

410
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:26,973
I've ever met in my life.

411
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,653
We fell in love at first sight.

412
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,213
I thought...

413
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:33,853
I thought I could start a happy life.

414
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,492
But it was until I found out

415
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:40,812
that she's your daughter,

416
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,893
my stepsister.

417
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:44,373
Why?

418
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,853
I've already stayed out of your life.

419
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,492
Why did you show up

420
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:49,572
and ruin my life again?

421
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:55,292
It wasn't my fault that you met.

422
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:56,893
Besides,

423
00:23:58,092 --> 00:23:59,413
she's your sister.

424
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,133
It was your fault!

425
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,453
If you didn't abandon me,

426
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:07,653
would I even meet Rui

427
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:08,653
like this?

428
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:13,853
Hello?

429
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:14,933
Hello, Miss Zhu.

430
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:17,012
Is Yan Yuan with you?

431
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:18,332
No, he's not.

432
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:19,653
What about your father?

433
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,532
I think he's resting in his room.

434
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:22,173
What's wrong?

435
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,532
I have something to ask him.

436
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,532
Can you put him on the phone?

437
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:30,532
Dad.

438
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:34,613
Dad.

439
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,052
That's weird.

440
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:40,933
My dad is not home.

441
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:43,812
Where did he go?

442
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,853
He left a postcard.

443
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:54,732
It looks like Chengdong Park.

444
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,933
This is my beginning

445
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,572
and also my end.

446
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:01,853
Rui,

447
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:03,332
I wish you happiness.

448
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:05,572
This...

449
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,653
Yan Yuan left this.

450
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:10,653
(This is my beginning and also my end.)
What does he mean by these words?

451
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:17,893
So you deliberately approached us.

452
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:19,893
What exactly do you want?

453
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,893
I only want an apology.

454
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:23,732
Do you know

455
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:26,213
there has been a type of black bird

456
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:28,413
that always appears around me
after I returned from the cruise?

457
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,133
Whenever I was in danger, they'd appear

458
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,772
and protect me.

459
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,173
And I can control them.

460
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,653
Later, Zifeng also found
something wrong with me.

461
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,133
So I told him everything.

462
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:39,492
He decided to seek justice for me.

463
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:41,092
So he pretended to kidnap those kids.

464
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,373
It was nothing but a cover.

465
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,973
Your grandson had always been
the target.

466
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,373
He did so much

467
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,332
just to see

468
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:50,133
if you were truly a cold-blooded person

469
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,492
or if you were just cruel to me.

470
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,133
Zhu Chunsheng.

471
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:55,853
I only want you

472
00:25:57,332 --> 00:26:00,292
to apologize to Zhu Boyan.

473
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:04,693
After that, I'll disappear
from your life completely.

474
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:08,173
I didn't expect...

475
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:09,853
Who are you?

476
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,252
My son, Yan Yuan, died when he was five.

477
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:13,413
I overestimated you.

478
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:14,772
Let me go!

479
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:15,973
Let go!

480
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:16,572
Don't move!

481
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,012
Of course, I remember Yan.

482
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:20,893
I named my children

483
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,853
according to the order of seniority
among siblings.

484
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:24,893
So that they'll remember

485
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:28,332
they had an older brother
named Zhu Boyan.

486
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,613
How dare you slander me
in the name of Yan?

487
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:34,613
You never wanted me to exist at all.

488
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:36,653
You've ruined Rui

489
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:39,332
and me.

490
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:41,373
It's your fault Zifeng died.

491
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:43,933
I've lost everything I cared about.

492
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,492
(Construction Area. Keep Out)
Stop!

493
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,092
- Don't come any closer!
- Yan Yuan!

494
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:48,772
Help me! Help!

495
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:49,933
Yan Yuan, calm down.

496
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:51,772
The police will arrive anytime soon.

497
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:52,653
Yan Yuan,

498
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:54,532
don't do anything stupid.

499
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:57,213
I know

500
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,012
you're not a bad person.

501
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:00,613
The last thing I want

502
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:01,933
is to get you involved in this.

503
00:27:02,373 --> 00:27:03,213
I know.

504
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:05,653
I know everything.

505
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,772
If you stab him,

506
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,213
you won't be able to turn back.

507
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,653
All you want is closure.

508
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:24,653
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,973
It was my fault.

510
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,413
I've got the answer I want.

511
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:46,893
So nothing can hold me back now.

512
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,413
If a fourth-dimension world exists,

513
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,173
I hope we won't have

514
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:57,052
a tragic encounter again.

515
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:04,973
- Yan Yuan!
- Yan Yuan!

516
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,613
The patient suffered
from prolonged cerebral hypoxia.

517
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,572
He may remain in a vegetative state.

518
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:24,492
Perhaps

519
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:27,572
it's not that Yan Yuan can't regain
his consciousness.

520
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:30,973
He's just too tired.

521
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:33,933
So he refused to wake up.

522
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:36,373
I'll stay with him.

523
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,373
Let him sleep for a little longer.

524
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,252
Will Yan Yuan

525
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:49,133
wake up again?

526
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:50,572
I don't know.

527
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,653
But even if he did,

528
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,332
he won't be able to face all these.

Why

do girls like to watch fireworks?

564

Because fireworks last for a short time

I want to be with you.

Is it because of Wu Miao?

577

I can help you find the killer.

578

It's not something you should do.

579
