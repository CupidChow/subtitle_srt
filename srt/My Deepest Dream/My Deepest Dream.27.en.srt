Wu Yu went to meet the murderer

is because
he fears that I might be hurt.

intentionally.

00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,362
Captain Shen.

172
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,602
Do you really think
they can manage this?

173
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,641
It's under my control.

174
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,161
We're at the entrance

175
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:57,881
and we're going up now.

176
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,641
Make sure that Wu Yu is safe.

177
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:24,482
Captain Shen.

178
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:25,761
We don't see the hostage
and the kidnapper.

179
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,122
Stay alert.

180
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:45,521
Captain Shen.

181
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:46,482
You can come up now.

182
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,482
We saw a chair.

183
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,722
No suspicious person at the scene.

184
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:50,881
Stay here.

185
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,842
Huang, follow me.

186
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:52,401
Yes.

187
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,362
(Wu Yu. Tan Jiao.)

188
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,281
(I know)

189
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:04,242
(only one of you)

190
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:06,242
(will show up here today.)

191
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,161
(It's fine. I'm patient enough.)

192
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:09,242
(Come to me one by one.)

193
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,602
(Once you're here,)

194
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,041
(you can never leave again.)

195
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,442
There's only Miao's picture here.

196
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:37,521
Bomb!

197
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:38,881
Hit the deck!

198
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:39,722
Watch out!

199
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:16,242
Are you alright?

200
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,362
Are you alright?

201
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:20,602
I'm fine, Captain Shen.

202
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:21,202
Good.

203
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,641
(The real game has just started.)

204
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:47,521
(Come here alone.)

205
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:53,681
Tan Jiao is in danger now.

206
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,082
I need your help.

207
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:24,641
Surprise.

208
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,641
As you wish,

209
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,761
I've spared Wu Yu

210
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,722
some more time.

211
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:38,401
But,

212
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,881
I wonder when he reads my message

213
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:43,881
knowing that you're here,

214
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:48,602
will he hope that he's the one
to be killed?

215
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,041
You can kill me now.

216
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,161
There is no rush.

217
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:08,842
I will kill you,

218
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,641
but not now.

219
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:15,362
Let's wait for Wu Yu to come

220
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:20,322
and watch you die with his own eyes.

221
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:25,242
I want him to feel the desperation

222
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,122
of letting his enemy
slip through his fingers.

223
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,041
Are you giving your hatred

224
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:32,801
to us

225
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,161
or to yourself?

226
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:38,561
What did you say?

227
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:41,281
Should I call you a silly guy
or a pathetic one?

228
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:44,962
You flattered yourself

229
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:47,801
by fabricating

230
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:48,681
a sad romance

231
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,442
through Zhou Wei's mouth.

232
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,442
In fact,

233
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,442
you're not her loved one,

234
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,681
but the accomplice of her death.

235
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:03,681
What did you say?

236
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,362
Sure enough.

237
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:12,641
Back then,

238
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,002
you nourished an unrequited love
for Ren Jie.

239
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,881
But you feel inferior

240
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,482
and weak.

241
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,921
You didn't dare to confess your love,

242
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,442
but to talk to her

243
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,921
under the cover of a net friend

244
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,561
on the internet.

245
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:30,801
In other words,

246
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,881
she wasn't your girlfriend.

247
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,641
It's just you fell
in one-sided love with her.

248
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,242
Am I right?

249
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:37,442
Shut up.

250
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:39,401
Fine.

251
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:43,641
If she weren't my girlfriend,

252
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,242
why did she come to seek help from me?

253
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:46,881
Chen Ningmeng has told me everything.

254
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,641
Ren Jie was a shy girl

255
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,561
and she was afraid and ashamed
at that time.

256
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,161
How could she possibly come to you?

257
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,122
You're just like those netizens

258
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,082
who knew about the incident
from the forum.

259
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,842
However, after you learnt of it,

260
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:06,002
you didn't seek justice for her.

261
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,681
Therefore, deep inside you,

262
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:12,761
you quipped

263
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,161
and looked down at her

264
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,641
like those netizens.

265
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:18,722
Shut up.

266
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:19,881
Nonsense.

267
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:23,322
I never mocked

268
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,881
or humiliated her.

269
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,722
At that time, I wanted to save her.

270
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,561
I wanted to save her.

271
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:53,881
Don't jump!

272
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:57,842
Who are you?

273
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,681
That's not important.

274
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,442
The only thing that matters is

275
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,842
if you really jump off from here,

276
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:06,882
none of them will get punished.

277
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,321
I don't want anyone to be punished.

278
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,482
I just want to return

279
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:15,121
to my usual life like before.

280
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,561
But, it's not going to happen again.

281
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,882
Everyone who knows me

282
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,402
will see these pictures

283
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:25,442
and they'll think

284
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,761
I'm an indecent and brazen girl.

285
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:30,482
No one will like me then.

286
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:31,922
No.

287
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:33,321
I...

288
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:35,922
I...I like you.

289
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,162
I've been in love with you.

290
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,601
No matter what,

291
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,761
I like you.

292
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:43,682
Are you

293
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,442
Captain Jack Sparrow?

294
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,121
Jie.

295
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,482
Please come down.

296
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:57,081
Okay?

297
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:01,561
Please come down.

298
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,521
You have no difference
from those netizens

299
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:20,162
who despised her.

300
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:21,882
Or perhaps

301
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,202
Ren Jie didn't mean to kill herself.

302
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:25,801
No.

303
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:29,202
It's because of the four women.

304
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,601
They killed her.

305
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,162
How much you loved her then

306
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,682
is reflected in
how much you hate yourself now.

307
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,922
However, you can't
vent your remorse out.

308
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,002
Finally, it led to your twisted
and grotesque mind.

309
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,601
Therefore, you killed

310
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,442
everyone who's related to this incident

311
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,121
with the most gruesome method.

312
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:50,402
Shut up.

313
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:51,722
They deserve this.

314
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:53,361
They deserve to be killed.

315
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:54,402
Even Ren Jie stepped up bravely

316
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:55,761
to seek justice for herself.

317
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,041
But, you hid behind

318
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,281
and orchestrated all those evil acts.

319
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,321
Shut up.

320
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:01,841
You're just like

321
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,281
those internet trolls who attacked her

322
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:04,722
in concealment.

323
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:05,402
Shut up.

324
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,801
You're in no position to avenge her.

325
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,402
Simply because you don't deserve
to do so.

326
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,841
Shut up.

327
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:17,882
I don't deserve to do so?

328
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,162
Over the years,

329
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,202
I miss her so much at all times.

330
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:22,202
For her sake,

331
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,162
I can go to hell

332
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,002
and become a demon.

333
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,922
You think I don't deserve to avenge her?

334
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,162
You were trying to provoke me.

335
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:42,682
So that

336
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:45,521
Wu Yu won't risk his life here.

337
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:46,402
Am I right?

338
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:48,361
Therefore,

339
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,242
both of you can enter

340
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,402
the next time travel again

341
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,281
to change history

342
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,482
and finish me off.

343
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,642
You knew everything.

344
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,841
At first, I only had

345
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,482
some vague memory fragments.

346
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,962
The annihilation of Yan Yuan

347
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,922
and Professor Chen and his family

348
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,922
disappeared as if
it had never happened.

349
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,642
It's like they've been living
happily and peacefully

350
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,801
in a family as always.

351
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,202
The same memory kept on emerging

352
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,402
but it was different each time.

353
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,281
You seem to know my future moves

354
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:36,682
like the back of your hand,

355
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,202
disrupting my plans several times.

356
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:41,882
With all these clues,

357
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:44,841
the answer is visible.

358
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,962
Wu Yu won't come here.

359
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:47,761
As long as one of us

360
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,041
survives,

361
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,321
you're doomed to fail.

362
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,841
No.

363
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,361
If it were as easy as

364
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,281
you said,

365
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,761
why did you come to catch me then?

366
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:01,121
Why do you court your death here?

367
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:06,682
Let me think about it.

368
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,442
I know it.

369
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,162
Is it because

370
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:17,281
time travel is coming to an end

371
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:21,841
or your ability to foresee the future

372
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:24,002
is going to drain off?

373
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,682
No.

374
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:29,722
I see.

375
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,281
The crucial point is

376
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:39,442
the chance to save Wu Miao
is wearing thin.

377
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:40,841
Am I right?

378
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:49,761
Wu Miao has nothing

379
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:50,962
to do with this incident.

380
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:52,561
She never hurt Ren Jie

381
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,841
as well as you.

382
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:54,801
Yes.

383
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,561
True.

384
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:02,081
But, she's Wu Yu's younger sister.

385
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,922
She's the only weapon
that can be of my help.

386
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,761
The revenge for your loved one
is just an excuse for you

387
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:08,482
to maliciously hurt an innocent girl.

388
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,801
You're shameless.

389
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:11,442
Yes.

390
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:14,281
We're all shameless

391
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:15,962
and sinful.

392
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,601
Only she and Jie

393
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:21,962
are pure.

394
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,442
Like the angels.

395
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:28,281
Nevertheless,

396
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,561
what does the world bring to them?

397
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:34,482
It's only slander, insults
and devastation.

398
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:38,121
I want to send them off

399
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,841
before the dirty world

400
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,761
sullies them.

401
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:47,202
I'm helping them.

402
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:48,202
Do you understand?

403
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:50,482
You're out of your mind.

404
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,442
You're insane.

405
00:22:58,882 --> 00:22:59,482
Alright.

406
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:02,281
The scene of introducing our identities

407
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,162
should end here.

408
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:07,361
I don't want this to delay

409
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:10,121
the best part for Wu Yu.

410
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:39,601
Wu...Wu Miao.

411
00:23:44,162 --> 00:23:44,841
Wu Miao!

412
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:19,281
Wu Yu.

413
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:20,642
You go in alone first.

414
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:21,561
Keep in touch with us.

415
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,242
More talking and less fighting.

416
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,841
So that I can learn more about
the situation inside

417
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,841
and make arrangements.

418
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:05,121
Wu Miao.

419
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:06,081
Stay put.

420
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:08,841
If you come any further,

421
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,642
I'll kill them in front of you.

422
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:12,882
Treat me as your only target.

423
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:13,761
Release them.

424
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:17,642
Say something.

425
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,482
Do you think you can be a bystander

426
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:23,002
and sit in the auditorium?

427
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,841
For now, we are all

428
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,402
on the stage.

429
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:31,041
We're all actors under the limelight.

430
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:33,601
Auditorium, stage.

431
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:37,561
They're in the theatre.

432
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,442
Wu Yu and the two ladies are
on the stage.

433
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,121
The location should be

434
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:42,882
(Stage)
somewhere near the limelight.

435
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:44,361
The suspect is possibly

436
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:45,722
hiding in the auditorium.

437
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:49,281
An.

438
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,281
Lead a team to check

439
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,642
the lighting box above the stage.

440
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:52,882
To see whether the situation can be
seen from there.

441
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:53,482
Yes.

442
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:55,841
Copy that.

443
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:57,561
Captain Shen.

444
00:25:58,162 --> 00:25:59,121
After Wu Yu entered the theatre,

445
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:00,722
all the entrances were locked
from the inside.

446
00:26:00,722 --> 00:26:02,561
Besides, the doors were installed
with encrypted mechanical locks.

447
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:04,041
Our colleagues are trying to break in.

448
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,081
It might take some time.

449
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:10,882
Wu Yu.

450
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,242
Give me more information.

451
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:14,801
We need some more time.

452
00:26:18,682 --> 00:26:20,202
Don't worry, ace student.

453
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:22,202
Coming next,

454
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:25,242
I'll give you
a multiple-choice question.

455
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:26,601
I guarantee

456
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:29,682
this is the most interesting question

457
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:32,121
in your life.

458
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,202
But before we start,

459
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:38,242
I'd like to introduce a new toy to you.

460
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:47,521
Do you know

461
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,922
what's on their necks?

462
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:54,841
It's just a thin band.

463
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:56,521
Nothing special.

464
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:58,841
No, you're wrong.

465
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:00,642
It's a very special

466
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:02,761
artistic work.

467
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:05,722
It contains a tiny motor

468
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,521
with specially designed compound gears

469
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,281
to pull the steel wire.

470
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:12,361
When one wears it around the neck

471
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,682
and activates the motor,

472
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:16,162
the wire will become tightened.

473
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:19,402
Also, once the device is activated,

474
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:21,361
no one can stop it.

475
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:24,521
It'll continue to tighten,

476
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,642
nonstop,

477
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:28,801
until...

478
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:30,281
Until...

479
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:43,002
Isn't it fun?

480
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:44,761
No worries.

481
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,561
Before it breaks the necks

482
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,962
of your beloved sister and Tan Jiao,

483
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,041
the police can't rescue them.

484
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:55,002
There's only you and me here.

485
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:58,962
Report to the leader

486
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:00,242
to request backup
from the related experts.

487
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:01,081
Now, we need to find out

488
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,402
what the device is on their necks.

489
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:02,962
Yes.

490
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,041
How's it now?

491
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:08,561
Captain Shen.

492
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,002
The snipers have scouted the area.

493
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:11,041
There are no windows in the theatre.

494
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,041
It's a sealed place.

495
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:13,402
The reason why he chose this place

496
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,882
is that no suitable place
can be found for the sniper.

497
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,081
Got it.

498
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:18,121
Well.

499
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:20,081
Keep on searching for other entrances
to the theatre.

500
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:20,561
Also,

501
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:21,482
check with the cybercrime unit

502
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:22,722
to see if they've found
the identity of the suspect.

503
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,442
Got it.

504
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:27,682
Wu Yu.

505
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:30,081
The question of the day is

506
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:31,761
you only have a key

507
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:33,682
and before the countdown ends,

508
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,041
you have the chance

509
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,962
to insert the key

510
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,442
in one of their devices

511
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,321
to save only one of them.

512
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,281
Simultaneously, another device

513
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:43,682
will be activated.

514
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:51,361
Captain Shen.

515
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:52,561
Captain Shen.

516
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,561
The cybercrime unit sent us
the information.

517
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:55,841
They found a netizen

518
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,682
named Captain Jack Sparrow

519
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:57,962
and identified him as the suspect.

520
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:58,801
They have hacked the account

521
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:00,521
and managed to track down
the person's identity.

522
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,281
The person's real name is Duan Yunying.

523
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,601
Got you.

524
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,242
I guess

525
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,081
you have a plan

526
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,002
running in your mind, right?

527
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,722
If you do nothing,

528
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,601
the two devices will be activated
simultaneously

529
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:19,002
when the countdown is over.

530
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:21,521
If you don't cooperate with me
in this show,

531
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,722
the remote control in my hand

532
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:25,801
will switch on the devices immediately

533
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,162
to take away their lives.

534
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,841
You can come up to the stage now.

535
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:35,202
The game starts now.

536
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:47,242
Miao, are you alright?

537
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:48,601
Yu, I'm scared.

538
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:50,242
Don't be scared. I'm here for you.

539
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:52,242
Give me a second.

540
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:58,482
Are you alright?

541
00:29:58,482 --> 00:29:59,081
Wu Yu.

542
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:00,442
This guy is out of his mind.

543
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:01,281
Don't care about me

544
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:02,202
Save Wu Miao now.

545
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:03,321
I'll save the two of you.

546
00:30:04,882 --> 00:30:06,242
Don't waste your time.

547
00:30:07,281 --> 00:30:08,402
I've told you

548
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,841
that even if you use

549
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,682
the strongest hydraulic scissors
in this world,

550
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:15,041
it'll take you ten minutes to break it.

551
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,442
Make your choice now.

552
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:17,722
Mr. Wu Yu.

553
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:21,521
Today, only one girl will die.

554
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,281
The survivor

555
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:24,841
is decided by you.

556
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:26,482
You're the judge

557
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:28,281
and also the executioner.

558
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:30,361
I'm just an audience.

559
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,242
It's fun, right?

560
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:33,722
Scoundrel!

561
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,482
I know it's hard

562
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,081
to abandon your loved one.

563
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:40,761
From what I know,

564
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:43,801
you just got engaged
the day before yesterday, right?

565
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:45,361
You can't bear her dying for sure.

566
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:47,162
Are you going to give up
on your sister then?

567
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:52,081
You have risked your life for her

568
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,281
and it's going to become a joke now.

569
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:54,882
Wu Yu.

570
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,242
Don't let him influence you.

571
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,521
Save Miao now.

572
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,281
Think about what we have done so far

573
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,442
and our goal.

574
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,361
Just leave me.

575
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,521
Rescue Miao now.

576
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:05,202
If I were you,

577
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,841
I'd choose Wu Miao.

578
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:10,841
Can't you travel back in time?

579
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,321
You can restart every time, after all.

580
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:17,002
However, the pain she's enduring now

581
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:18,482
is real.

582
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,801
She suffers the pain genuinely.

583
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:26,202
Now,

584
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,642
you have two minutes left
to make your choice.

585
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:30,402
Within two minutes,

586
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,922
you can save one of them.

587
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,281
Wu Yu.

588
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:35,642
Wu Yu.

589
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:36,642
Wu Yu, look at me.

590
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,442
Listen.

591
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:40,242
I know

592
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:41,882
you can make the choice wisely.

593
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:43,962
You must save Miao.

594
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:45,521
I trust you.

595
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:48,121
Please trust me too.

596
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,761
We can't let the murderer
off the hook easily.

597
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,841
Like what he said just now,

598
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,561
the prime point of our time travel

599
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:57,882
is to rescue Miao.

600
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:00,841
She's a simple

601
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,121
and beautiful existence.

602
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:06,002
She must survive.

603
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,402
You must survive too.

604
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:09,521
I...I will.

605
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:12,722
Wu Yu.

606
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,081
Did you forget

607
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:16,682
that I can foresee the future?

608
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:19,521
I saw it this time.

609
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,202
I saw the final scene of this travel.

610
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,162
You, me

611
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:28,482
and Miao

612
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,281
are safe and sound in the end.

613
00:32:32,442 --> 00:32:33,242
Believe in me.

614
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,642
I can't let you take the risk.

615
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,281
I can't let you

616
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:40,482
suffer this pain.

617
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,682
As long as you're by my side,

618
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:44,642
I have no pain,

619
00:32:46,722 --> 00:32:47,722
but sweet memories.

620
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:49,801
Do you still remember

621
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:53,722
we were watching the fireworks
by the lakeside?

622
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:56,162
Even though

623
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,121
you broke up with me there,

624
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,482
it's still the most wonderful memory

625
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,121
in my life.

626
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:07,682
And also we danced on the deck,

627
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,642
released the sky lantern by the shore,

628
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:14,402
and watched the beautiful rainbow
together.

629
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:16,601
Wu Yu, do you know that?

630
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:20,682
Some people can't experience

631
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,442
all those sweet moments
in their entire lives,

632
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:26,081
but I did.

633
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,761
Because I met you.

634
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:32,521
Wu Yu.

635
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:35,442
I never regret what I've done.

636
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:38,962
I'm willing to.

637
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:41,482
Thirty seconds left.

638
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:45,361
Wu Yu.

639
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:46,882
Don't worry.

640
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:48,882
I'll wait for you on the island.

641
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:50,682
Trust me.

642
00:33:51,882 --> 00:33:53,442
Don't worry. We're all set.

643
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:55,402
No matter who you choose,

644
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,561
we'll save the other one

645
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:57,841
immediately.

646
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:02,442
Tan Jiao.

647
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:04,361
Please trust me.

648
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,682
I trust you.

649
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:48,601
I love you.

650
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:49,962
I love you too.

651
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:50,842
Wait for me.

652
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:57,601
Wu Yu.

653
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:35,681
One team goes over there.

654
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:36,521
One team follows me.
