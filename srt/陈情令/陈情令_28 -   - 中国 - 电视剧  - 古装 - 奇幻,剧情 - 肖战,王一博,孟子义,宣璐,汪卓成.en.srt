1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 28

3
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
You're having bats in your belfry again.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,680
Can he count as a human now?

5
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
What's his difference from those

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
puppets we killed?

7
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,320
Wei Wuxian,

8
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
was that really you?

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,760
Jiang Cheng,

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
you too suspect I took that shard of Yin Iron?

11
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,000
Even if he's not a puppet

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,880
how can he be distinguished from puppets?

13
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,680
You want to awake his consciousness back

14
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
which is almost impossible.

15
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,320
Yeah.

16
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,120
I also think it's so difficult.

17
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,280
But I've

18
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,840
boasted a dozen times to his sister.

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,000
Every last one of them believes that I can save him.

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
I have to do this favor.

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,440
Or I'll bring shame on myself.

22
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,040
What are you doing!

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,880
What am I doing?

24
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
I'd like to ask the question.

25
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,040
Wei Wuxian,

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
How prestigious you are all this while.

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,320
What are you two doing?

28
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,760
Wen Qing.

29
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,120
Please leave here.

30
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,560
Rest assured.

31
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm here.

32
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,880
Wei Wuxian,

33
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,360
I've been pushed by you to the edge of a precipice.

34
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
These days

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
all major and minor clans in Jinlintai

36
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,120
are confronting me endlessly.

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
They all want an account from me.

38
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,200
So I had to come here.

39
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,640
What account?

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,000
This case has been closed.

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
Those overseers got Wen Ning killed.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,520
Wen Ning killed them in turn.

43
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,720
Life for murder, money for debt.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,640
Let's call that the end.

45
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,200
They suppose Wen Ning has died anyway.

46
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
Call that the end?

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,240
Impossible!

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,279
Do you know

49
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
how many eyes are spying on you

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,280
and spying on your Stygian Tiger Amulet?

51
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,520
If they caught you in this situation,

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
what is justified would be unjustified.

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,520
You've spoken it out.

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,080
What is justified would be unjustified.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
What else way can I go

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
except confining myself here?

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Way?

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,680
Of course there is.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
The only way to mend this

60
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,280
is to finish it by ourselves

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
before the others can take actions.

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,320
What do you want to do?

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,400
You come back with me

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
and turn in everybody here.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,920
Are you kidding?

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,280
If I turn them in,

67
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,920
The only ending is that they'll be killed.

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
Having gone this far,

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
you still cares about the endings?

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,480
Jiang Cheng!

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Listen to what you just said.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,200
Take it back.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
Or I'll beat you.

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,960
Don't you forget

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,200
who brought back the bodies of

76
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,240
uncle Jiang and madam Yu.

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,640
Who sent back those cremains

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
buried in Lotus Cove.

79
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,200
And who took us in

80
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,640
when Wen Chao was hunting us down.

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
Wei Wuxian!

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,280
I'd really like beating you up.

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,520
True.

84
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,280
They did have saved us.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
But why don't you understand?

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,880
Survivors of Wen clan are the target of public hatred.

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,120
Whose family name is Wen is of the most heinous guilt.

88
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,960
As for those who defend them

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
they are going against almost everyone in the world.

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Everyone resents Wen clan.

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,360
and is hoping Wens have the most miserable ending.

92
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
Defenders of Wen clan

93
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
are opposing the mainstream.

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,360
No one will speak for them.

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Especially no one will speak for you.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't need anyone speaking for me.

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,360
What on earth are you insisting on?

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,720
If you can't do it,

99
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
just step aside.

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll do it.

101
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,320
Wei Wuxian,

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,120
do you understand that?

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,120
In the eyes of four main clans

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
you're a geek,

105
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,400
a rare swordman,

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,480
a defiant hero,

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
and the only one of your kind.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,240
But once you're out of tune with them,

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
you become outrageously frenzied,

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,760
ignorant of ethics,

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
and wicked as demons.

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
You thought you can be independent and yourself.

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,760
you can travel and live without restraints.

114
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,720
There's no such precedent.

115
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,120
No precedent?

116
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,040
I'll be the precedent.

117
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
Wei Wuxian,

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,200
can't you see the situation?

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
You have to let me say it out?

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,760
If you persist in defending them,

121
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,840
I won't be able to defend you.

122
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
Unable to defend me?

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,200
Just leave me then.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,440
Leave me.

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,640
Tell the world,

126
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,760
I defected.

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
From now on everything I do

128
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
has no concern with you Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Wei Wuxian.

130
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,440
Tell me

131
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,080
what on earth you're doing this for?

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
Jiang Cheng,

133
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,240
I tell you honestly.

134
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,280
If it weren't Wen Qing and her brother,

135
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,080
for anyone else,

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,480
I'll make the exactly same choice.

137
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Wei Wuxian,

138
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
are you addicted to playing hero?

139
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
You'll die if you can't

140
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,800
be prominent?

141
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,760
Not a bit did my mom said it wrong.

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,559
You are the trouble maker of our clan.

143
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,720
Try something forbidden.

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
You know the discipline of Jiang clan, huh?

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
You know better than me.

146
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
You all do.

147
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Let's decide when to fight then.

148
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
Yuan.

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,440
Let's stop. We've had enought.

150
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Grandma. I want more.

151
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm hungry.

152
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
Be good, Yuan.

153
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
When it's dawn,

154
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll take you to pick fruits.

155
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm hungry.

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,680
Here.

157
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Yuan.

158
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,040
Take this.

159
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,480
Qing.

160
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Are you not feeling good today?

161
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,000
You didn't eat a bit.

162
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,960
You should keep it to yourself.

163
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,680
I'm fine.

164
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,000
Yuan is still a child.

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Yeah.

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
Yuan has to eat much.

167
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,160
These are for Yuan.

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,920
Good. It's from big brother.

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
Fourth uncle.

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Distribute the rest to everyone please.

171
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,560
OK.

172
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,680
Here.

173
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,680
When crops can be raised on our virgin land,

174
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,040
we can stop catching fish and picking fruits then.

175
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,880
And Yuan...

176
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,160
can be satiate everyday then.

177
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,840
Right.

178
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
It's unexpected that in such wild area

179
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,520
can grow some real food.

180
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
We can go down the mountain to buy some seeds,

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,360
and grow some vegetables.

182
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,360
Down the mountain?

183
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,480
Can we do that?

184
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
Wait a while longer I think.

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
Wait till that trend is out.

186
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
Grandma said this one is sweet.

187
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,600
You eat it.

188
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't know the reason but

189
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,680
fruits today taste specially sweet.

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Wanna take a bite?

191
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,040
Young as Yuan is,

192
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,320
he can eat so much.

193
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,920
Fruits today were almost eaten up.

194
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,440
This is the last one.

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
You really don't want it?

196
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,160
Well.

197
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,720
Wei Wuxian.

198
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,360
You should go.

199
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,160
Go?

200
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,160
Go where?

201
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,720
Where you came.

202
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm actually quite content with the situation now.

203
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,400
As long as Ning is by my side,

204
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
that would be enough.

205
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
You don't have to bother yourself for him no more.

206
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,200
Whether he can awake his consciousness back

207
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,920
depends on himself.

208
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,040
We've almost settled down here.

209
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
I'll take care of the rest.

210
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,960
You are from Jiang clan after all.

211
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Not like us.

212
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
Wu Wuxian,

213
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,920
please go.

214
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,280
You...

215
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,200
What?

216
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,880
You said you didn't want it.

217
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,120
Wei Wuxian!

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,760
What's wrong?

219
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,840
I leave it to you.

220
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,160
I leave it to you, OK?

221
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,600
Here.

222
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,520
Eat it to death then.

223
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,360
Wen Qing.

224
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,120
I've said it.

225
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,680
I'll bring Wen Ning back to normal.

226
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
I'll definitely achieve it.

227
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,720
If you're here to persuade me,

228
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,800
please don't even start.

229
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Childe Jiang.

230
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,360
This comb.

231
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm afraid I can't have it after all.

232
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,880
At that time,

233
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,280
why didn't you bring it

234
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,960
to Lanling and find me?

235
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
At that time,

236
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,280
if I had met you first in Lanling,

237
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,360
would you have taken me to rescue Ning despite everything?

238
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,640
Ning.

239
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,880
Our encounter with Wei Wuxian

240
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,000
was a fortune

241
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
or a misfortune?

242
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,080
Sister.

243
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,160
- It hurts. - Ning.

244
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,200
Sister

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,880
- It hurts. - Ning.

246
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,240
- Ning! - Sister.

247
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,680
Afraid naught. Sister is here.

248
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Sister is here. Ning.

249
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,160
It hurts.

250
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,320
Afraid not. Ning.

251
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,000
Ning. Ning.

252
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,920
Sister.

253
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,120
Don't be afraid.

254
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,680
- Don't be afraid. - It hurts.

255
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,040
Ning.

256
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,400
Ning.

257
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,600
Jiang Cheng.

258
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,920
You seriously needed to be this harsh?

259
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,880
Clan Leader.

260
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,200
Clan Leader.

261
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,520
Pass my words

262
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,680
to all cultivation clans.

263
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,240
Wei Wuxian defected

264
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,720
and rivals against all clans.

265
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,480
He's been banished from Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

266
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,240
Clan Leader. Seriously that senior brother...

267
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,720
From now on, Wei Wuxian and Jiang clan of Yunmeng

268
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,320
will never associate again.

269
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,360
Xian!

270
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,000
Xian!

271
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,280
Xian!

272
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,800
Xian!

273
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,640
Xian.

274
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,800
Xian.

275
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
Where are you going, Xian?

276
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,600
Xian! Over here!

277
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,440
Xian!

278
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Xianxian!

279
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,400
Xian!

280
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,360
Xian!

281
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,600
Xian!

282
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,440
Cheng.

283
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Cheng. Look at Xian.

284
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,160
Xian is in wrong direction.

285
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,320
You have to get him back.

286
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,400
Cheng.

287
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,000
Xian! Come back, Xian!

288
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,640
Xian!

289
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Lady Jiang.

290
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,040
Lady Jiang. Are you there?

291
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,520
Lady Jiang.

292
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,560
Lady Jiang, are you there?

293
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,040
Yes.

294
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,560
How can I help?

295
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,800
Mrs. Jin desires for your presence.

296
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,240
But my brother Jiang Cheng is coming back.

297
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,800
Clan Leader Jiang hasn't arrived yet.

298
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,920
I see.

299
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,280
Please tell Mrs. Jin

300
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,560
I've got to get changed. Will be there soon.

301
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,480
Understood.

302
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,320
Good you're here.

303
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,400
I've bought the potatoes back.

304
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Tell everyone to put them in the ground tomorrow.

305
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,240
Don't look at me like that.

306
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,000
I've already bought them.

307
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,480
It's about time to give up on your turnips.

308
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,760
Oh, right.

309
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,320
I've also bought some meat.

310
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,640
Start cooking now. Everyone can get to taste meat tonight.

311
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,440
What are you doing?

312
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,080
Male and female shouldn't be improperly intimate.

313
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
You suddenly doing this

314
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,080
makes me sacred.

315
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,320
Alright, alright.

316
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,880
I know that you want to heal my wound.

317
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,280
But I'm really fine.

318
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,880
You see.

319
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
But if you keep delaying your cooking like this,

320
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,040
I might not be fine then.

321
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,040
I'd starve.

322
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,600
Where are you going?

323
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,600
Exchange them for turnips.

324
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,960
Haven't I said it?

325
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,120
No entry for anyone.

326
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,840
Childe Jin.

327
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,320
You can come up first.

328
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,800
OK.

329
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
I didn't mean to intrude.

330
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,880
Sorry.

331
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,560
It was Mrs. Jin who called me here.

332
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,360
No problem.

333
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,760
I'd really like going back to Lotus Cove.

334
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,920
Childe Jin. Excuse me.

335
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,960
Lady Jiang.

336
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,640
I know

337
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,560
here is not Lotus Cove.

338
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,240
But,

339
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,200
But I'm willing to

340
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,600
build another Lotus Cove for you.

341
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,440
Lady Jiang.

342
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,400
Zixuan.

343
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,520
In my opinion,

344
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,520
this Yiling Patriarch is a scourge.

345
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,280
Who wouldn't say so?

346
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,880
Tell you what.

347
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,960
The ancestral grave of the family of my next door neighbor's big aunt

348
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,679
was dug recently.

349
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,920
It must have been him.

350
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,000
Listen to that!

351
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,600
I have to say

352
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,560
that I heard he is making what puppets using corpses.

353
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,320
How horrifying!

354
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,199
In the Qiongqi Road

355
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,440
he even turned a living people into a puppet

356
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,760
which led to a dozen of death.

357
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,560
That puppet was a survivor of Wen clan.

358
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,800
Since that,

359
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,440
people calls him as Ghost General.

360
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,000
But after the case in Qiongqi Road,

361
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,960
the whereabouts of Ghost General is unknown.

362
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,840
Where else could he be?

363
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,200
He must be doing vice along with the Yiling Patriarch.

364
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,440
You people

365
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,400
just know the half of it.

366
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,000
Yiling Patriarch's terrifying abilities

367
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,280
are more than making puppets.

368
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
His dirty tricks

369
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,920
were nothing but horror.

370
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,600
I'm telling you.

371
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,080
He dug those bodies

372
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,040
for cracking bones and sucking marrow

373
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,560
to help enhance his wicked tricks.

374
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,760
If Jiang clan of Yunmeng hadn't adopted and cultivated him,

375
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,200
Wei Ying woud be

376
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,280
a mediocre wandering in streets.

377
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,560
He should have defected his clan

378
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,680
injured the young Clan Leader Jiang.

379
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,480
Traitors like him

380
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,880
should be killed if anyone would catch him.

381
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,320
- That's right. - Yeah!

382
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
- Right. - Should be killed.

383
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,960
This kind of people shall be killed.

384
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,720
- Yeah. - Right. He deserves death.

385
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,040
Strange.

386
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,360
Who is that guy?

387
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,160
Why did he look at me like I owe him money?

388
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,800
Excuse me,

389
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,800
this has sprouted.

390
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,760
What do you want?

391
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,640
Please a bit cheaper.

392
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,600
No arguments.

393
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,960
You can pick those hasn't sprouted.

394
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,640
I just picked a random one. It's sprouted.

395
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,600
Which means not many good ones here.

396
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,440
You see.

397
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,880
It's your bad luck.

398
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,920
No arguments seriously?

399
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,160
No.

400
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,560
Forget it then.

401
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,920
I don't wanna bother to buy.

402
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
Pick a random one and it's sprouted.

403
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,200
I may have food poisoning if I eat this.

404
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,480
Don't you agree, Yuan?

405
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,560
Yuan!

406
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,440
Yuan!

407
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,840
Yuan!

408
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,880
What's going on?

409
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,480
What is the child doing?

410
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
What happened?

411
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,160
Such a little boy cries so badly.

412
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,560
Was he scolded by his dad?

413
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,200
- How can the father... - I'm not.

414
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Listen! Everyone!

415
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,520
You see? You must be his dad. Must be.

416
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,560
Your noses look exactly the same.

417
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,040
Don't you agree? Everyone?

418
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,840
- Yeah. - That's right.

419
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,400
This man is so cold.

420
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Look how the child is crying.

421
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,600
Was he scolded by his dad?

422
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,520
He dosen't even know to hug and comfort the child.

423
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,680
Just leave him crying on the ground.

424
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,840
How are you being a father?

425
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,480
So young.

426
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,160
It must be your first time to be a father, right?

427
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
I didn't know anything like you

428
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,960
back then.

429
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,600
But I know everything now after my wife gave a few more births.

430
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,440
- Right - You see.

431
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,720
It's a learning progress of raising a child.

432
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,840
Boy. Where is your mother?

433
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,000
Boy. Don't cry now.

434
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
- Boy. - Where is his mother?

435
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,360
Where is his mom?

436
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,880
- Where is his mom?
- You as a dad don't do anything.

437
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,080
Where is his mom then?

438
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,640
Lan Zhan.

439
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,240
Who is this guy?

440
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,160
I don't know.

441
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,680
Please leave. Nothing to see now.

442
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,920
Do what you were going to do.

443
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,920
Let's go.

444
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,040
Come on.

445
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,040
- Come and see my goods.

446
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
Lan Zhan. What a coincidence.

447
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Why did you come to Yiling?

448
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,720
Night hunt.

449
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,880
Passing by.

450
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,920
This child...

451
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,520
This child...

452
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,640
This child is my son.

453
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,440
Right. Lan Zhan.

454
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,920
What did you do?

455
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,600
Why he is crying?

456
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,720
I didn't do anything.

457
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,280
I got it.

458
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Lan Zhan,

459
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,440
pretty as you look,

460
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,480
you always look like bearing a lot hatred.

461
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
The child is still young.

462
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,720
He can't tell beauty and ugliness.

463
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,240
So once he's stared at by some unamiable uncle like you,

464
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,160
he's definitely gonna cry.

465
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Lan Zhan. Watch.

466
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,200
Come and see! Toys on sale!

467
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,440
- Come and see! - Yuan.

468
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
Toys on sale.

469
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,920
Have a look.

470
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,760
Yuan.

471
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,920
- Boy...  - Look,

472
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,680
Isn't it pretty?

473
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,560
Yes.

474
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,680
It is?

475
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,320
Come.

476
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,880
You see. Like it?

477
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,240
- Yes. - Yes?

478
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,040
You really do?

479
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,120
Mister, here.

480
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,560
Come on.

481
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,600
Wei Ying.

482
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,800
Why didn't you buy it for him?

483
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Why should I?

484
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,680
You asked whether he wants it.

485
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,080
Doesn't that mean you're going to buy it?

486
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,960
Asking is asking, buying is buying.

487
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,440
Who said you have to buy once you asked?

488
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,040
Which one do you want?

489
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,880
Come and see!

490
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Among these,

491
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,280
which you want?

492
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,840
Come. Come and see.

493
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,720
Trinkets. Come and see.

494
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,400
Favored by children or adults.

495
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,800
Come and see.

496
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,320
Customer. What do you want?

497
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,800
Lan Zhan. Congratulations!

498
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
He's fond of you now.

499
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,760
He'll hug the thigh of those who he likes.

500
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,320
And he'll never let go.

501
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,560
So how about you quit your night hunt

502
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,880
and we can have a meal together.

503
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,200
Meal?

504
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,320
Don't so cold.

505
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,760
You seldom come to Yiling.

506
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,080
And I ran into you.

507
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,280
Let's talk about our old days.

508
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,480
Let's go. Let's go.

509
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,320
My treat .
