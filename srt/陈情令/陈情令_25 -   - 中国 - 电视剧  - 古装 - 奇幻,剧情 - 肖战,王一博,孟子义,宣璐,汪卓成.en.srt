1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 25

3
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,110
Look at your skinny arms and legs.

4
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,360
You seem so weak.

5
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,160
How can you carry a blade or wield a sword in the future?

6
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,470
You have to work out often!

7
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,110
It has to be enhanced that,

8
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,960
your master is the awe-inspiring Clan Leader Jiang.

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
Understand?

10
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,630
Jiang Cheng, you are just in...

11
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,800
My arrival today

12
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,320
is to send the invitation.

13
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,670
I want to invite you Jiangs to participate in the Crowd Hunt.

14
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Childe Jin even came in person

15
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,630
just for such little things as sending an invitation.

16
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,030
It seems that us Jiang clan of Yunmeng

17
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,720
really has the honor.

18
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,630
This is my mother's order.

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,360
She sincerely hopes that Miss Jiang

20
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,030
could also come along to watch the hunt.

21
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
With Mrs. Jin's kind invitation,

22
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,000
I

23
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,000
would like to accept the invitation.

24
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,030
That's great!

25
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,630
I mean that

26
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,630
my mother will be so delighted

27
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,270
to see you.

28
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,030
Childe Jin, hence

29
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,440
please forgive us for not seeing you off.

30
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,920
Childe Jin,

31
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,480
haven't you heard it clearly?

32
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,230
Please.

33
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,350
Why you keep looking at me?

34
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,390
Am I that good looking?

35
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,110
So,

36
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,510
do you have any business to talk with me?

37
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
By the way, Childe Wei,

38
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,790
with my arrival this time,

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
my father reminded me to ask you that

40
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,600
when you and Second Childe Lan went for Yin Iron

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,270
in the Sunshot Campaign,

42
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,480
you have bound Xue Yang up to Yet Clean Realm.

43
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,830
Now the other three shards have been destroyed.

44
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,320
Childe Wei,

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,350
do you know

46
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,230
where is the last one?

47
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,000
I have no idea why Childe Jin asks me this question.

48
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,320
Just answer my question!

49
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,390
Why do you have so many questions?

50
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,230
Childe Jin, are you exercising your authority now?

51
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,070
You!

52
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,070
Childe Wei,

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,350
my father needs to assist cultivation clans to investigate Yin Iron.

54
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,000
If you don't want to help, then forget it.

55
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,640
Besides,

56
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,230
At the Sunshot Campaign,

57
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,970
the spiritual power of Stygian Tiger Amulet

58
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,050
has affected many cultivators of ours.

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,790
I hope Childe Wei can hand in the Stygian Tiger Amulet

60
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
in the Floral Banquet after the Crowd Hunt.

61
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,880
So the cultivators affected can feel relieved.

62
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,880
All people here must know the rules already.

63
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,600
I want to highlight again that

64
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,880
this row of targets

65
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,390
is the first barrier before entering the mountain.

66
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,070
Only participators who hit one of the target

67
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,760
outside the range,

68
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,640
can achieve his entering ticket.

69
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,510
The target has seven circles

70
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,230
which correspond to seven mountain paths.

71
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,320
The closer your arrow hit the center red point,

72
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,040
the easier the way will be.

73
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,510
And this year,

74
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,480
we have designed

75
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
a special activity

76
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,640
to delight our guests.

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Go!

78
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,790
Hurry up!

79
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,160
Hurry up!

80
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,320
Go!

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,880
If someone stood before the target,

82
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,320
it will be much difficult to hit the target.

83
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,110
Your skills shall be tested then.

84
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,110
Not that difficult at all.

85
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,350
Stand up! Stand still!

86
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,910
Who want to challenge,

87
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,880
just step forward.

88
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,350
I'm waiting to see

89
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,840
who can have a better shoot?

90
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,110
Anyone else?

91
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,670
Lan Zhan,

92
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,960
do me a favor.

93
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,640
What's the matter?

94
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,520
Can I borrow your headband?

95
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,880
Well done! Well done!

96
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Great!

97
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,030
Well done! Well done!

98
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,030
Well done! Well done!

99
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,080
Childe Wei!

100
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,030
Well done!

101
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,200
The opening shooting

102
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,000
is to warm you up.

103
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,670
Of course you all are qualified to participate.

104
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,080
So how about

105
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
canceling the opening ceremony

106
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,790
and please start the hunt now.

107
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,320
That's just an opening shooting.

108
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,590
Practice your showy tricks!

109
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,470
Have you just covered your eyes?

110
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,670
How about covering your eyes in the whole hunt

111
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,640
if you are really that capable?

112
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,400
We'll see how capable you are and who's the winner

113
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,550
later in Mount Phoenix.

114
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,840
That's a deal.

115
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,880
Let's go.

116
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,280
Clan Leader! Clan Leader!

117
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,470
What happened?

118
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,400
Just now,

119
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,350
all specters and evil spirits

120
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,790
are like being controlled by someone

121
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,710
and plunged into our meshes themselves.

122
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,030
What happened?

123
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
I have told you not to overdo it.

124
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,910
There are set rules in the world.

125
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,350
I hope Childe Wei shall not be so self-centered

126
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,830
that people caring about you are affected by it.

127
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Lan Zhan,

128
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,880
I heard you are tired for amending your family instructions recently

129
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,470
in Cloud Recesses.

130
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,950
I made some progress in composing the music score

131
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,350
and want to share with you

132
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
to see how it works.

133
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,830
Lan Wangji,

134
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,760
who do you take me for?

135
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,280
Can't you leave me alone?

136
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,000
who do you take me for?

137
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,070
I had once taken you as

138
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,800
my whole-life confidant.

139
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,680
Still, I am.

140
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,430
I have guessed that Mrs. Jin

141
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,110
would definitely ask senior sister out alone

142
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,160
with Childe Jin.

143
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,230
This place is dangerous.

144
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,430
There is mucus left by Stature Measuring Snake.

145
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,110
What's it?

146
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,040
A devil snake came from the southern uncivilized region.

147
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
It will just lift up its upper body

148
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,190
to compare its length with man's stature.

149
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,470
If it's longer, it will swallow the man.

150
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,830
It may looks scary

151
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,470
but nothing to be afraid at all.

152
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,350
This one has scales on it.

153
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,710
It may be a variation

154
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,230
which is hard to deal with to a common man.

155
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,280
Yet,

156
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,230
in this Crowd Hunt,

157
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,310
all preys are so common

158
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,230
and they can't hurt disciples in Jin clan of Lanling.

159
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,560
It is best that nobody is hurt.

160
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,590
Nobody is hurt?

161
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,350
Then what's the fun in hunting if no one is hurt?

162
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,680
If you come to our personal hunting ground

163
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,590
in Lanling,

164
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,470
you can see many rare preys.

165
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,190
I'm available next month

166
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,160
and I can take you there.

167
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
I appreciate your invitation.

168
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,430
Yet,

169
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,230
there is no need.

170
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,760
Why?

171
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,680
Because you dislike watching the hunt?

172
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,590
Then why you come this time?

173
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,680
I was...

174
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,880
I...

175
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,280
Do you dislike watching the hunt

176
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,310
or staying with me?

177
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,920
No.

178
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,040
Not the fact.

179
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,400
I...

180
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,520
Forget it!

181
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,430
Sorry.

182
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,680
You don't need to apologize.

183
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,280
You can interpret it anyway you like.

184
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,830
After all I'm not the one who invites you.

185
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Forget it if you are unwilling to come.

186
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,560
You bastard!

187
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,760
Anyway,

188
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,400
senior sister can learn his real character

189
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,350
and never has any association with him.

190
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,470
Excuse me.

191
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,710
Wait.

192
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,070
Wei Wuxian, why you appear again?

193
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,190
That's my question.

194
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,560
Why you again?

195
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,230
You started the fight without any reason. Are you crazy?

196
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,800
Without any reason?

197
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,710
You are the reason!

198
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,640
Why you stop her angrily after being refused?

199
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,950
If I don't stop her,

200
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,000
shall I leave her alone in this mountain?

201
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,280
Hanguang Jun.

202
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,710
What happened?

203
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,680
Zixuan,

204
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,280
did Wei cause trouble to you again?

205
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,560
Leave it to me.

206
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,280
Wait.

207
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,950
Why?

208
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,560
Want another fight?

209
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,680
Wei,

210
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,710
what do you want?

211
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,280
Why you keep troubling Zixuan?

212
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,310
Who are you?

213
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,310
How dare you, don't know who I am?

214
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,070
Why should I know?

215
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,230
You...

216
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,590
Aunt.

217
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,470
Mother, why you come?

218
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,430
Don't be self-sentimental.

219
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,040
I come here not for you.

220
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,760
Li,

221
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,640
why you look upset?

222
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,920
I appreciate your care,

223
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,430
but I'm fine.

224
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,830
Has my intractable son

225
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,590
bullied you again?

226
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,590
No.

227
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,710
Zixuan. What's wrong with you!

228
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,110
What did you promise to me before leaving?

229
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,310
I...

230
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,350
No matter what

231
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,800
your son has promised to you, Mrs. Jin.

232
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,640
But from today on,

233
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
he and my senior sister

234
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,760
no longer has any association.

235
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,680
Wei Wuxian,

236
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,430
my aunt is your senior.

237
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,190
How can you talk in this way!

238
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,190
Aren't you being too proud?

239
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,350
I don't mean to disrespect Mrs. Jin.

240
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,160
But your cousin

241
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,830
has again said harsh words to my senior sister.

242
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,590
If we Jiang clan of Yunmeng can endure it again,

243
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,040
we no longer deserve the name of a gentry family.

244
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,950
Hence how can you say I'm too proud?

245
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,430
You are too proud to know yourself.

246
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,350
Today is a big day for the Crowd Hunt.

247
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,230
You are really the center!

248
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,070
Thirty percent preys have been captured by you.

249
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,710
Aren't you proud of yourself?

250
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,640
Thirty percent?

251
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,230
Hanguang Jun,

252
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,350
you may not know yet.

253
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,110
We were hunting in the hunt ground just now.

254
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,920
After quite a while,

255
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,880
we found it surprisingly

256
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
that none of the preys was in the hunt ground.

257
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,560
Yes.

258
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,280
After asking Lianfang Master in the hunt watching stand,

259
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,950
we came to know that

260
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,760
within thirty minutes

261
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,680
with a sound of flute came from Mount Phoenix,

262
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,350
almost all preys

263
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,560
walked into the meshes set by Jiang clan

264
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,520
one by one

265
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,040
to sacrifice themselves.

266
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,590
Wei Wuxian,

267
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,310
you are so selfish

268
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,590
and never think about the others.

269
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,310
Aren't you too proud?

270
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,280
You Jins have said that

271
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,040
in the hunt, capability talks.

272
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,190
Why you betray your own words?

273
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,230
What you practiced is just dirty malign tricks

274
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,680
not your own capability.

275
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,710
You can do more but play your flute.

276
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,710
How can it be called a capability?

277
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,920
I didn't play any dirty tricks.

278
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,560
Why can't it be own capability?

279
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,710
Or you can play the flute?

280
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,110
Let's see anything will follow your sound?

281
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,310
You break rules.

282
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,590
It isn't any better than playing dirty tricks!

283
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,710
Fine.

284
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,950
If I don't know what's called capability,

285
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,920
then please show me yours.

286
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,800
Astonish me please!

287
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,560
You!

288
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,950
It's understandable that you don't know you are wrong.

289
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,230
It's not the first time

290
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
that you have broken the rules.

291
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,070
Last time, at the Floral Banquet

292
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,040
and this time in the Crowd Hunt, you never carry your sword.

293
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,880
At such a solemn occasion,

294
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,800
you know nothing of etiquette.

295
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,070
Where do you place us

296
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,400
those who participate together with you?

297
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,590
Lan Zhan, I forgot to thank you

298
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,000
for shielding me from the sword just now.

299
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,920
Thanks!

300
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,400
Jiang clan of Yunmeng

301
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,800
has no better etiquette as this.

302
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,350
They even produce a demonic cultivator.

303
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,350
Zixun!

304
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
Family discipline?

305
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,880
Dirty malign tricks?

306
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,400
Wei Ying!

307
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,760
Don't you want to know

308
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,560
why I refuse to carry my sword?

309
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,560
It doesn't matter, even I tell you.

310
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,040
No need to carry my sword, me, Wei Wuxian,

311
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,190
will beat you all

312
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,000
just depending on the dirty malign tricks in your mouth

313
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,710
and leave all of you far behind.

314
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,430
Wei Wuxian,

315
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,800
you are no more than a son of a servant.

316
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,430
Don't be insane!

317
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,110
Wei Ying,

318
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,560
concentrate!

319
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,640
Wei Ying,

320
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,920
concentrate!

321
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,520
Xian!

322
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,470
Xian!

323
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,520
Stand behind me.

324
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,710
Senior sister!

325
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,040
Li, don't be angry!

326
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,400
Let them to deal

327
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,800
their business.

328
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,470
Childe Jin,

329
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,040
you have just said

330
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,430
that it's Xian who alone

331
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,160
has taken thirty percent of preys

332
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,310
in Mount Phoenix away.

333
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,950
He broke the rules and was too proud.

334
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,350
I...

335
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,520
I don't know much about this.

336
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,760
It may really cause some troubles for you.

337
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,070
I will apologize to you all for him.

338
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,950
Senior sister!

339
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,190
Lady Jiang is really polite and decent,

340
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,760
and can tell the right and wrong.

341
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,230
What your junior brother has done

342
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,230
is indeed wrong

343
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,040
and caused some troubles.

344
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,590
Yet,

345
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,920
no need to apologize

346
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,640
for the sake of you and Clan Leader Jiang.

347
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,280
After all we Jin clan of Lanling and Jiang clan of Yunmeng

348
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,040
are like brothers.

349
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,800
Yet,

350
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,000
although I haven't participated in the Hunt before,

351
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,070
I do understand

352
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,470
that since ancient time to today,

353
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,110
there isn't a rule in the hunt

354
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,040
to forbid one participator to have too much preys.

355
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,950
You just said that

356
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,880
Xian broke the rule.

357
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,230
I want to ask which rule has Xian just broken?

358
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,640
Lady Jiang,

359
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,400
this may not be right!

360
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,070
Although some rules haven't been written out,

361
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,160
we all learn them in our hearts

362
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,470
very clealy.

363
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,590
Besides,

364
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,110
we've been obey the rules well.

365
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,880
That's right!

366
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,950
There are not much preys in the hunt ground!

367
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,190
No more than five hundred?

368
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,190
How many participators are there?

369
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,350
More than five thousand!

370
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,280
It was a hard competition already!

371
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,350
What's more, he has taken so many preys himself!

372
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,230
For you,

373
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,190
will you agree?

374
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,520
It's not his fault that you can't hunt the preys!

375
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,830
Capability talks in the hunt.

376
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,590
Although Xian took a different method,

377
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,070
he studied it with efforts.

378
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,400
You can't make the judgment

379
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,070
that he practiced the dirty malign tricks,

380
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,830
just because you can't hunt enough preys.

381
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,400
Besides,

382
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,920
let's focus on the hunt

383
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,470
not our family education.

384
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,680
Xian is a disciple of Jiang clan of Yunmeng

385
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,560
who grew up together with me and my brother.

386
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,560
We are like real bother and sister.

387
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
You referred to him as a son of a servant casually,

388
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,040
which is unacceptable to me.

389
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,920
Hence,

390
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,520
I hope you Childe Jin Zixun

391
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,830
can apologize to Wei Wuxian from Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

392
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,160
Li,

393
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,470
don't take it seriously.

394
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,830
Relax.

395
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,800
Mrs. Jin,

396
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,920
Xian is my younger brother.

397
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,400
A humiliation to him

398
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,590
is not something trivial to me!

399
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,110
Zixun,

400
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,230
have you gotten it?

401
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,430
Aunt!

402
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,280
- Brother. - Wangji.

403
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,830
Why are you here too?

404
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,070
My friends,

405
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,880
why you all gathered here?

406
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,920
What happened?

407
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,040
Laugh?

408
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,680
How can you still laugh?

409
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Look at the Crow Hunt held by you!

410
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,190
Useless!

411
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,590
Mother, what happened on earth?

412
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,800
What happened?

413
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,400
Well, can't you figure it out yourself?

414
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,760
Aren't you good at judging the situation?

415
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,920
About thirty percent preys have been hunted

416
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,710
in Mount Phoenix.

417
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,880
How many preys are left to us,

418
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,430
the other five thousands participators?

419
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,800
Lianfang Master has prepared to

420
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,040
expand the region of the hunt ground.

421
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,400
Please calm down.

422
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,430
This hunt is just a farce!

423
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,590
Forget it!

424
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,710
I withdraw.

425
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,040
Zixun,

426
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,640
I have made the preparation.

427
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,520
No more than a half hour.

428
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,430
Childe Jin.

429
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,110
Childe Jin, no need to withdraw.

430
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,310
There is no rule left in this hunt anyway.

431
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,880
Why should I wait?

432
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,640
I'll leave first!

433
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,230
Childe Jin! Childe Jin!

434
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,350
Mrs. Jin,

435
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,800
I caused some trouble for you this time.

436
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,470
Li, nothing about you is a trouble to me.

437
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,470
My son has made you upset.

438
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,760
If you are unhappy,

439
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,950
I can beat him for you.

440
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,160
No need to.

441
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,760
Mrs. Jin,

442
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,640
I'll take my way then.

443
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,350
Wait.

444
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,230
Come back to me to tthe hunt watching stand.

445
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,880
Let Zixuan accompany you.

446
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,040
- Zixuan. - No need to.

447
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,470
I...

448
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,640
Wei Wuxian will accompany me.

449
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,830
Li,

450
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,590
you and Wei Wuxian,

451
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,710
a young man and a young woman. It's not proper

452
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,800
for you two to stay alone together often.

453
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,590
Xian is my younger brother.

454
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,040
Li,

455
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,190
your mother is a bosom friend of mine.

456
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,230
Forgive me for saying too much

457
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,640
that you two are no longer children.

458
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,000
If you often stay alone together,

459
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,160
people may make idle talks.

460
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,590
Besides, he has strong wicked energy on him.

461
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,520
He may does something evil.

462
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,470
Take my advice,

463
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,000
stay away from him.

464
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
Mrs. Jin,

465
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,110
Xian is my younger brother.

466
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,830
I'll never leave him.

467
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,560
Li,

468
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,910
are you still angry with my son?

469
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,280
If you are angry with him,

470
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,280
I will,

471
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,000
I will teach him a lesson indeed!

472
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,630
Sincerely no need to.

473
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,120
Mrs. Jin,

474
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,520
please don't force him.

475
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,120
No, I didn't.

476
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,600
Mrs. Jin,

477
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,600
I don't want to cause more troubles to Childe Jin.

478
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,230
Farewell.

479
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,670
Farewell. Mrs. Jin.

480
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,320
Li!

481
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,040
Zixuan, hurry up!

482
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,710
Lady Jiang!

483
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,080
Wait, Lady Jiang!

484
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,600
You misunderstood me.

485
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,910
It's not what you thought. Lady Jiang.

486
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,760
Not what you thought!

487
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,320
I wasn't forced by my mother.

488
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,190
Not forced!

489
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,630
Not forced at all!

490
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,910
It's me!

491
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,520
It's me who want to invite you.

492
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,280
I...

493
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,840
Zixuan,

494
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,040
my silly son,

495
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,230
why you run away?

496
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,390
Childe, Childe!

497
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,470
Childe, Childe!

498
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,430
Li, let's go!

499
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,120
Come back with me to Jinlintai.

500
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,320
Later in the Floral Banquet,

501
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,560
I'll ask him to apologize again.

502
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,430
Let's go!

503
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,230
Senior sister!

504
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,080
It's fine, Xianxian!

505
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,190
Fine.

506
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,150
Then,

507
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,080
Mrs. Jin, please take care of my senior sister.

508
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,910
Wei Wuxian.

509
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,080
Jiang Cheng,

510
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,710
you just missed an interesting drama.

511
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,670
What's it?

512
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,470
Forget it!

513
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,760
I'll leave now.

514
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,630
Wei Wuxian, where are you going?

515
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,360
There is a Floral Banquet after the hunt.

516
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,360
Come with me.

517
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,280
I want to walk around the Lanling City.

518
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
I may not accompany you.

519
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,760
Lan Zhan,

520
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,430
farewell.

521
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,430
What a mess.

522
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,000
It's not your fault today.

523
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,670
Clan Leader Lan,

524
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,800
I hurried here for seeing rays of swords.

525
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,600
May I ask what happened?

526
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,360
It's better for you to ask your sister in person

527
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,950
at the Floral Banquet.

528
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,560
Yes.

529
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,230
It's not proper for us outsiders to make comments.

530
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,120
Clan Leader Jiang, we'll go there first.

531
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,670
Clan Leader Jiang,

532
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,280
Childe Wei in your clan

533
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,320
is really somebody!

534
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,000
This time, the Lotus Cove really made a hit.

535
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,360
Almost all evil ghost

536
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,800
were summoned into meshes set by Jiangs.

537
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,320
Many cultivators will then become their disciples.

538
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,150
Yes.

539
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,600
What can we do?

540
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,710
We don't have Wei Wuxian anyway.

541
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,040
Having Wei Wuxian is not something beneficial.

542
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,710
I don't want to have someone like him,

543
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,950
who causes trouble to me everyday.

544
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,840
Did you hear

545
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,320
that the treasure of Wei Wuxian

546
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,360
the Stygian Tiger Amulet,

547
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,430
is made of Yin Iron?

548
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,120
Really?

549
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,630
It's the lost one.

550
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,600
I eavesdropped that from Lianfang Master.

551
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,800
Although it's not certain yet,

552
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
think of it,

553
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,040
if it is not made of Yin Iron,

554
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,320
how can it be such a coincidence.

555
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,710
When the shard of Yin Iron lost,

556
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,630
Wei Wuxian then has the Stygian Tiger Amulet.

557
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,670
I guess

558
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,710
that the shard must be taken by Wei Wuxian.

559
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,560
You may be right.

560
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,600
Wei Wuxian is too proud of himself!

561
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,870
Anyway all night hunts have the Jiangs

562
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,910
will not have me.

563
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,950
The Jiang clan?

564
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,120
It has nothing to do with them.

565
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,230
To make it frank,

566
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,000
it's all Wei Wuxian.

567
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,430
In the Sunshot Campaign,

568
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,080
they all depended on Wei Wuxian himself.

569
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,630
That's why Jiang clan of Yunmeng has made their reputations.

570
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,520
Forget it! Let's go!

571
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,710
Go!

572
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,870
Stay away, you dirty homeless!

573
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,390
Wangji,

574
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,710
I feel that you are worry about something.

575
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,600
What's it?

576
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,230
Brother,

577
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,230
I...

578
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,430
I want to bring a man to Cloud Recesses.

579
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Bring a man,

580
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,800
to Cloud Recesses?

581
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,320
Bring him back,

582
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,430
and hide him there.

583
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,950
Hide him?

584
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,800
He may be unwilling to go, will he?
