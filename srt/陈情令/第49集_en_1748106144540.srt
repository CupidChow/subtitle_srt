1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know if I can get the key because I'm not sure if i can get it.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key because I'm not sure if I can get the key.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I'm not sure if I can get the key to the key.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Ah, gosh.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
The End

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Episode 1

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
Brother.

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
How long have we been together?

20
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
No matter what,

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
I know how I treat you.

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I have no intention of going to the capital.

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920
The Yinghu family has already been separated.

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
The Jinye State is going to stay away from Dongying.

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
It's not coming back.

26
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Just look at these.

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Let me go.

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Chief Jin.

29
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I have already said that you should take care of the chaos in the country.

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Brother.

31
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Don't bother about it anymore.

32
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Brother.

33
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm the one who's in trouble.

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm the one who's in trouble.

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
But...

36
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I have no way out.

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
What do you mean?

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
You...

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Brother, don't talk to him.

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Yes, Zou Wu Jun.

41
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Did you forget what you said to Chief Jiang just now?

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Don't talk to him.

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Brother.

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
What I said was true.

45
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I received a letter.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
What letter?

47
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,920
A letter from Wei Xian.

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,920
I've lost my mind.

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
After that,

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I will be able to control the world.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I will be punished for my crimes.

52
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,920
I will be punished for my death.

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,920
So you're going to take the blame for the chaos in the country?

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
You have no right to blame me.

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Even if the enemy really put you through all this,

56
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
you have already experienced a loss.

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
You're hurt, right?

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Even so,

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
you can't just sit and do nothing but kill.

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
You have to do it.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
What can I do?

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
When this matter is solved,

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
and the whole city is covered in rain,

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,920
after I have spent all my money,

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I will kneel and apologize to the people.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I will send my face to them, beg them, and forgive them.

67
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Brother.

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
There is no way out.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
It's not because they died.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
It's because of me.

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Isn't it all because of you?

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
If you didn't do so many bad things,

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,920
how could you have a chance to be in their hands?

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I didn't let myself do those things.

75
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
You can't deny it.

76
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,920
If it wasn't for my own good, why would I do it?

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Brother.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Don't you trust me at all?

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm asking you a few questions.

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,920
You can tell me one by one.

81
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Brother, I have my own dignity.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
He won't talk about Huayang.

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
First,

84
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
you can

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
take

86
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
your sister,

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
and your brother.

88
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
You know what your relationship is.

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Why did you kill him?

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I really can't.

91
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Brother.

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I can't.

93
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I can't.

94
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
I can't.

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I can't.

96
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I can't.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I can't.

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
I can't.

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
How could you not?

100
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
You're your own marriage.

101
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
You can't go.

102
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
You've ruined a woman who loves you,

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
and respects you.

104
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
You can't see your own daughter.

105
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Brother.

106
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Didn't I really hurt her?

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Yes.

108
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,920
It's my marriage.

109
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,920
But I really can't marry her.

110
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Can I?

111
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I have to have a bottom line.

112
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
I've spent thousands of years,

113
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
and so many blood,

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,920
to make the Qin Zangye agree to my proposal.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm so angry.

116
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm so happy that I finally got the crown and Qin Zangye.

117
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
If I suddenly get married,

118
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
what should I use?

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
How should I explain to these two people?

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Brother.

121
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,920
You know when I thought everything was over,

122
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Mrs. Qin secretly came to tell me the truth.

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
What was I feeling?

124
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Even if I came to the sky,

125
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
and kicked me down,

126
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I wouldn't be more scared.

127
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Do you know why she didn't go

128
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,920
and asked me to beg for help?

129
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Because she was forced to do so.

130
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,920
My good father,

131
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
even didn't let go of his wife who has been with him for years.

132
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
He didn't even remember when he had a daughter.

133
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
For so many years,

134
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,920
he didn't even dare to tell his husband.

135
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
If I suddenly get back,

136
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Qin Guangshan and Qin Zangye are so cruel.

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
They are both not good.

138
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Who is the most cruel person?

139
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Even if...

140
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Even if you are not good enough,

141
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,920
even if you marry him, you can still be cold-hearted.

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Why are you still trying to be nice to him?

143
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I don't know

144
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,920
if I can hate that father who doesn't want to be a father.

145
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I hate him more than anyone else.

146
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
So you killed him too.

147
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Your father,

148
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
he...

149
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Why did he kill you?

150
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,920
He used that kind of method.

151
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,920
He...

152
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I've found a woman you like.

153
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,920
She is very nice.

154
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Are you happy?

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Yong!

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Since you have been with me for so long,

157
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,920
you won't be a maid anymore.

158
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Then I'll ask you again.

159
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Where is Jin Zixuan?

160
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Don't try to fool me. Tell me.

161
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I don't want to be a maid anymore.

162
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I don't want to be a maid anymore.

163
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,920
I don't want to be a maid anymore.

164
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Did you do a good job

165
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,920
of killing Mr. Jin?

166
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Jin Zixuan did not do anything wrong.

167
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,920
What did you do?

168
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
What did you do?

169
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Tell me!

170
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Ayao.

171
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Hurry up.

172
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Ayao, what are you doing here?

173
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
What's wrong?

174
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Nothing.

175
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Ayao, you don't even dare to look at me when you lie.

176
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Tell me. What happened?

177
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Ayao.

178
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
It's all my fault. I didn't find out...

179
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
I asked Jin Zixuan to take someone out.

180
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Where did he go?

181
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Where else could he go?

182
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I don't know. The poison is gone.

183
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
What?

184
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Why didn't you stop him?

185
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
I don't know. He said he wanted to go out.

186
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I... I can't control him.

187
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I'll go after him.

188
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Why?

189
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Why?

190
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Why?

191
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Why? Why?

192
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Uncle Xiao, why did you do this?

193
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Tell me why you did this.

194
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Why?

195
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Tell me.

196
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Why did you do this?

197
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Why?

198
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Why?

199
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Why?

200
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Ayao, can you tell me why?

201
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Tell me why I'm always filial to you?

202
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
I might not have a good face.

203
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
But your father is not suspicious.

204
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,920
But he is always being unfair to you.

205
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Can you tell me why you are the son of a single man?

206
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Your father can always stay with his beloved wife...

207
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
and take care of his own child.

208
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
But I...

209
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,920
But I must be the one who will do everything for my own father.

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Why is he always the same?

211
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
He can give another son a happy birthday...

212
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
while he is still a child.

213
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,920
He can also see the other son...

214
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,920
falling off the stage.

215
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:47,920
He wants me to be changed from the top to the bottom.

216
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,920
A'Li, tell me now.

217
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Is this all for me?

218
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I don't want to be a good person.

219
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I have been looking forward to my father.

220
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
As long as he is alive,

221
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,920
no matter how good I am,

222
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I will always be the one who will do everything for my own father.

223
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I will always be the one who will do everything for my own father.

224
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,920
No matter how good I am,

225
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
no matter how good I am,

226
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,920
no matter how good I am,

227
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,920
no matter how good I am,

228
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,920
I will always be the one who will do everything for my own father.

229
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,920
A'Li, do you know what I am completely disappointed in?

230
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,920
It's not that I can never put on a hairpin...

231
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,920
or that he has taken back Mo Xun Yu.

232
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,920
It's not that he even doesn't even let me hug you.

233
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,920
It's not that he can't even try to frame me.

234
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
It's that...

235
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Second, when he went out to the Sky and Earth again,

236
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,920
he was so heartless to the nine girls.

237
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Do you know why a great family like him,

238
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,920
who is not willing to waste any little money on his own,

239
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
gave birth to my mother?

240
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
He gave birth to my mother?

241
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
He gave birth to...

242
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
No way.

243
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Women are the most troublesome. Especially women who have read books.

244
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,920
If he gave birth to her,

245
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
then he will be in trouble all his life.

246
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Eat a bone soup.

247
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
It's delicious.

248
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
It's delicious.

249
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Master, don't you have a son?

250
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Son?

251
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I won't mention him.

252
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Drink.

253
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Second brother,

254
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
look.

255
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
My son...

256
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
is worth four words.

257
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
It's not worth it.

258
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
He is always your father.

259
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
But you...

260
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,920
What's the use of saying these things now?

261
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
What's the use?

262
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
It's useless.

263
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
It's useless to say anything now.

264
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
There's no way.

265
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,920
You've done something bad,

266
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
but you still want to be implicated.

267
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I am just a human being.

268
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Jinliang!

269
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Go.

270
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Wei Wuxian, didn't you break his weapon?

271
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
I did break his golden thread.

272
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Unless Jin Guangrong's cultivation

273
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
is already high enough to be able to control the screen.

274
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
He is hiding in the body.

275
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
It's really a good way to cut it.

276
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Ling!

277
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Don't be so impulsive.

278
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Ling is also a grown-up.

279
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I still want to say that

280
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
the road and the sky are all the same.

281
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
In a short time,

282
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,920
you will naturally see a good and innocent Ling.

283
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Jin Guangyao, you want to be human.

284
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
You want me too?

285
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
That's different.

286
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
You've been hurt by the Chief Jiang.

287
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,920
You will be punished.

288
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Chief Jin,

289
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,920
you seem to have forgotten something important to you.

290
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Your most loyal subordinate is still on my side.

291
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Chief, don't force me.

292
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Thank you.

293
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Chief Jin,

294
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
you said that again.

295
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Only this time?

296
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
If you don't force me,

297
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
you will say the same thing again.

298
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I don't know what you are talking about.

299
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
What is the truth?

300
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Si Zui?

301
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Senior Wei,

302
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Lord Hanguang,

303
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
I really can't stop him.

304
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Who can stop him?

305
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Brother!

306
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Brother!

307
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Brother!

308
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
What's wrong?

309
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
It's me.

310
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Brother!

311
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Senior Wei,

312
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
what's wrong?

313
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Why are you holding the barge?

314
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I don't know.

315
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Si Zui,

316
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
what's wrong?

317
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I don't know.

318
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I didn't meet him before.

319
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
I want to stop him,

320
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
but I can't.

321
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I can't.

322
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Brother!

323
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Brother!

324
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
What's wrong?

325
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,120
Why didn't you listen to me?

326
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,040
Could it be...

327
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Dou Lin's father?

328
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
No!

329
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Wei Wuxian! Jin Ling!

330
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Jin Ling!

331
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Jin Ling, are you okay?

332
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
I'm okay. I'm okay.

333
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Where is he?

334
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Master!

335
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Master, do you have medicine?

336
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Help me!

337
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,920
Our master has been in a bad state recently.

338
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Please help us!

339
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Master!

340
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Master!

341
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Master!

342
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Master!

343
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Master!

344
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Shut up!

345
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Master!

346
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Master!

347
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Master!

348
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Wenjing!

349
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Master!

350
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I only want to hug him!

351
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Master!

352
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
I'll stop him!

353
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
You go!

354
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Master!

355
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Master!

356
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Master!

357
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Wei Wuxian!

358
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Master!

359
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Master!

360
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Master!

361
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Master!

362
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Master!

363
00:34:48,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Master!

364
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Wuxian! Wuxian!

365
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Wuxian!

366
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Wuxian!

367
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Why did you kill me?

368
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Wuxian!

369
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Wuxian!

370
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Help!

371
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
No!

372
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
No!

373
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
No!

374
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
No!

375
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
No!

376
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
It's your fault!

377
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Help!

378
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Help!

379
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Help!

380
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Help!

381
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
No!

382
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Master!

383
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Watch out!

384
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Master!

385
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Master!

386
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Master!

387
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Master!

388
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Master!

389
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Master!

390
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Wait!

391
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Please!

392
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Brother Xie!

393
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
My leg is still there!

394
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
It's okay, Huaisang.

395
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Don't be afraid.

396
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
It's just a broken leg.

397
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
It's not broken.

398
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
A broken leg?

399
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
No!

400
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
How can you not be afraid?

401
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Brother Xie!

402
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
I'm dying!

403
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
It's not that serious.

404
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Here.

405
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Eat this.

406
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
It's just pain.

407
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Why am I so unlucky?

408
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Mo Mingqi was caught by Su Minshan.

409
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Qingtian!

410
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,920
He's about to run away and give me a hand.

411
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
He doesn't know how to deal with me.

412
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
He just pushed me away.

413
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Why did you hit me?

414
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Let's go.

415
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Have a rest.

416
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Here.

417
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Chief Jin.

418
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Chief Jin.

419
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Please don't do anything useless.

420
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Otherwise,

421
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
I will not let you die in front of me.

422
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I will protect you now.

423
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Chief Jin.

424
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Huaisang.

425
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Give me that medicine.

426
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Okay.

427
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Huaisang.

428
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Brother Xie, be careful.

429
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
No.

430
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
What's going on?

431
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,920
I just opened three...

432
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
No.

433
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I just opened the back of Chief Jin's hand.

434
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
I don't know if he wants it or not.

435
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Is it?

436
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
No.

437
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Chief Jin.

438
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Chief Jin.

439
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Chief Jin.

440
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Chief Jin.
