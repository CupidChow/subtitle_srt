1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The first time I saw a black cat.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was surprised that it was a black cat.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I saw a black cat.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I saw a black cat.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Yuen Am Iiding Best

17
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,840
Yuen Am Iiding Good

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Good, A Yuan.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a good day.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you have milk, it's mom.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you have money, it's dad.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Brother Yan.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Good.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Good.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A Yuan knows to smile at me.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not enough.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't talk.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's really unreasonable.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I said it a few times before.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You said it once, then he heard it.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's unreasonable.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not reasonable.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are right.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You haven't changed for so long.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm familiar with this place.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you want me to take you?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lan Zhan.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are not lying at all.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you here for me?

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll have a drink.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Lan Zhan.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I wanted to invite you to my house.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But if you want to talk about love and respect,

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
then it's free.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can control myself.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No one needs to save me.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wei Ying.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, Lan Zhan.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I finally met a familiar person.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He didn't hide from me.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He has been forcing me to death for the past few months.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why don't you come and talk to me about

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
what happened outside?

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do you mean?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What new family?

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What new family?

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are the families that have been separated?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anyway, it's free to talk.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Tell me.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Lian Yin.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Lian Yin?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Whose family?

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Lian Yin's family.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The General of the Dream.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You mean I...

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Miss Xiang and Jin Zixuan?

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When did this happen?

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
When did this happen?

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Half a month later.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Such a big thing.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Xiang Cheng, that stinky brat.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He didn't tell me anything.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it's true.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even if he told me,

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what can I do?

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
On the surface,

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Xiang Cheng has already told the world

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
that I'm a traitor.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm already

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
unrelated to the Jiang clan of the Dream.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's the use of telling me?

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll tell you.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're right.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't believe Jin Zixuan is dead.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Man Zhan,

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
what do you think of this marriage?

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's true.

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why would I ask?

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Anyway, you won't care about this kind of thing.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know that there are many people out there

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
who say that my senior sister doesn't match Jin Zixuan.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But in my eyes,

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it's obviously that flower hole that doesn't match my senior sister.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Lan Zhan, do you know that

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
my senior sister is the best person in this world?

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I told Jiang Chengdu that

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I would let my senior sister's big gift

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
be in the 100 years of her life.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Everyone is a good person.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No one can compare to her.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to see my senior sister

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
have a bright future.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What do you want?

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can't see it anyway.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wei Ying.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh no, Lan Zhan is changing.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Lan Zhan, let's go first.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Lan Zhan, why are you following me?

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why didn't you meet me?

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I forgot.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What's wrong?

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Master Wei.

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Uncle Wan, what's wrong?

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's... it's Fu Ruodong.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Fu Ruodong, Fu Ruodong, I don't know what's wrong.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was just setting up the forbidden spell before leaving.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Who's moving?

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Be... Beg your pardon.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's... it's...

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Stop.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Stop.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Wan Ning.

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I've been using the fire talisman to repair you.

125
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I hope that it can help you find the new cure.

126
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's the last step.

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But I didn't expect that...

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wan Ning!

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Didn't I say

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
not to use the talisman on her?

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No one has ever touched her.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No one has ever used the blood talisman.

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She suddenly got crazy.

134
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
She used the talisman and the talisman

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to make her look like a ghost.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've never used it.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I've never used it.

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I've never used it.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've never used it.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've never used it.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've never used it.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I've never used it.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've never used it.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I've never used it.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The talisman and the talisman

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
have all been destroyed.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The blood talisman

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
has all been destroyed.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Wan Qing.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Take them away.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Miss, go!

152
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The talisman is gone.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No one can stop her.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She can't get out of here.

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The talisman is gone.

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The talisman is gone.

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The talisman is gone.

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wife.

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Ning.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Ning.

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Wife.

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Han Guangjun.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Please stop the bleeding.

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Ning.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Wife.

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wife.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Ning.

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Wife.

169
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wife.

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Lan Zhan.

171
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Master.

173
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Master.

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Master.

175
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ning.

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Master.

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Ning.

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Ning.

179
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Ning.

180
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wife.

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Wife.

182
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's done.

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ning.

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's done.

185
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Tell me.

186
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm the sister.

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm the sister.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm the sister.

189
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Ning.

190
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ning.

191
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How do you feel now?

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I...

193
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I...

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I really want to cry.

195
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But...

196
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I can't.

197
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You just had a nightmare.

198
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Now it's over.

199
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You made it.

200
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Of course.

201
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
At least what I said

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
must be done.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Lan Zhan.

204
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're here.

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why don't you go in and sit down?

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,300
When getting married.

207
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,000
Are you broke?

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm vlogging.

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Because of your 27 years as a wife.

210
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,880
In the future,

211
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
if you ask me what he has thinking about

212
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
my mom or mine.

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
OK, I'll make it.

214
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh really?

215
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
OK.

216
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,200
I know. You must be thinking that

217
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
it's not going to be so.

218
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Actually, I heard some rumors

219
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
that a person who's a good at math

220
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,600
has the right to name his own old court

221
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
as the Demon Lord.

222
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
But they all got it wrong.

223
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
The name I'm going to name

224
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
is not what they thought.

225
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
It's different from the beginning of the Xue Chonghai

226
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
to build the Demon Lord Hall.

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's simple.

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's just because I often sleep here,

229
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
there's a demon that's lying on the ground

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and sleeping on the ground.

231
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Isn't it called a demon cave?

232
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Come, I'll take you out for a walk.

233
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The Yin Qi is very heavy.

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But it's suitable for training.

235
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is my Liao Shang holy place.

236
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's similar to your home's cold spring.

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wen Ning used to be here, too.

238
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But,

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm not sure.

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm not sure.

242
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm not sure.

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm not sure.

244
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm not sure.

245
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not sure.

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But

247
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the Yin Hu is the source of the original energy

248
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that was drawn by Wen Ning.

249
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The water in this pond

250
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
is getting more and more like blood.

251
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's why it's called blood pool.

252
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Wei Ying,

253
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
what?

254
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Can you really control it?

255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

256
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you mean Wen Ning?

257
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Of course, no problem.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Look.

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Isn't she already restored her spirit?

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What if she's crazy again?

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's quite a surprise to deal with her.

262
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
She's now controlled by the Yin Hu.

263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I just need to control the Yin Hu.

264
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then it's no problem.

265
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What if you

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
get rid of the Yin Hu?

267
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No.

268
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How?

269
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No.

270
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I can't.

271
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
From now on,

272
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
do you plan to keep doing this?

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What's wrong with keeping doing this?

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Listen,

275
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
don't underestimate me.

276
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
My mountain is bigger than your mountain.

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's much better than yours.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Wei Ying,

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
do you know what I mean?

280
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Lan Zhan,

281
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you're so stubborn.

282
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I've already taken her away.

283
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You can pull her back.

284
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Your wound.

285
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No.

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm a little injured.

287
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why are you so weak?

288
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll sit here for a while.

289
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Sit here for a while?

290
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you think I'm dead?

291
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Mr. Wei,

292
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Mr. Lan.

293
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why are you here?

294
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're crying so soon?

295
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll cry if I see you cry.

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're laughing at me?

297
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You?

298
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're so vicious.

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Wei Ying.

300
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm even more vicious.

301
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Do you want to see me?

302
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm out of here.

303
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't want to try.

304
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Mr. Wei,

305
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Fine.

307
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You really think you can do me a favor?

308
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Wait.

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's going on?

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How can I drink water for her?

311
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Where's the tea?

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I asked before.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
There's no tea.

314
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's too much.

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Next time, the guests will have to...

316
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes.

317
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We don't need guests.

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go.

319
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll take you down the mountain.

320
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll take you down the mountain.

321
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's go.

322
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'll take you down the mountain.

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's go.

324
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's go.

325
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Lan Zhan.

326
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I thought you were asking me.

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Should I keep doing this?

328
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,440
Actually, I've been wondering

329
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,720
what else I could do

330
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
if I couldn't do it.

331
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,840
Can't I be a ghost

332
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,680
and give out the fire talisman?

333
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,120
What about the people on the mountain?

334
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,000
Let me give them up.

335
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,720
I can't do it.

336
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,200
But I believe that if I change you,

337
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,240
you can't do it either.

338
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,920
Is there anyone who can give me

339
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,040
a good-for-nothing?

340
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,200
Is there anyone

341
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
who can protect

342
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,920
the way of the person

343
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,720
even if he doesn't need the talisman?

344
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,520
Lan Zhan, thank you.

345
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Thank you for being with me today.

346
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,320
Thank you for telling me

347
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,920
that you're going to marry me.

348
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,680
But

349
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
if I don't do it,

350
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,960
I'll be in trouble.

351
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
I can't do it.

352
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,720
I have my own way of doing it.

353
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,520
I also believe

354
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,360
that I can control it.

355
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,360
I can control it.

356
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Brother, brother.

357
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
But don't you stay today

358
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,960
and eat with us?

359
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,280
Mr. Wei, I'm sorry.

360
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,240
Yuan, he...

361
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,840
Yuan, come here.

362
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,520
Yuan.

363
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,360
Yuan,

364
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,320
this brother has food at home.

365
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,360
He won't stay.

366
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,080
But I heard a secret.

367
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
They said that

368
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,880
it's delicious today.

369
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,760
Yuan.

370
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm leaving.

371
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,960
Eat first.

372
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,800
Brother Xian,

373
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,880
will Brother Qiu have to come back?

374
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,280
What does brother Qiu have?

375
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Brother Qian is Brother Qian

376
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,060
You really like him so much?

377
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Give it back to me

378
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Give it back to me, that's for me

379
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,120
No, no, no

380
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Unless you say you like Brother Xian

381
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I like Brother Xian

382
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Okay, here you are

383
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,260
Brother Xian, will Brother Qian come again?

384
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
No

385
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I don't think so

386
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Why?

387
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Not really

388
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Because in this world

389
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Everyone has their own thing to do

390
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Everyone has their own way to go

391
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
No matter how far west and east

392
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I will go to the dark side of the road

393
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:53,720
Brother Er

394
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,720
A single wood bridge is too dark.

395
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Too dark.

396
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,720
A single wood bridge.

397
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,720
It's not dark at all.

398
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
It's dark.

399
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Don't worry.

400
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
I have everything.

401
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Why are you still awake?

402
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Meat!

403
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
I'm so sleepy.

404
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
You're so sleepy today.

405
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Aren't you afraid of spending money?

406
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I'm just hanging out for you.

407
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Tomorrow, I'll make a few more wooden bridges.

408
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
It's dark and I can't walk well.

409
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll just fall down and fall to the bone one day.

410
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Hurry up.

411
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Sit. Sit.

412
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
What? You haven't eaten yet?

413
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
No. I'm waiting for you.

414
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Why are you waiting for me?

415
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Thank you for all these days.

416
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
You suddenly talk to me like this.

417
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm a little bit out of my mind.

418
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Actually, they've been wanting to eat with you.

419
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
They want to thank you.

420
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,720
But you didn't go out in the summer.

421
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,720
You just stayed in the house for days and nights.

422
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
They didn't let anyone disturb you.

423
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
They're afraid of delaying your business.

424
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
They're afraid of you.

425
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
They think you don't like to be friends with people.

426
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
They don't want to talk to you.

427
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
So they don't dare to talk to you.

428
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Aning is awake.

429
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
We're all busy with the celebration.

430
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
We didn't have time to talk to you.

431
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,720
You can sit down and chat with us.

432
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Let's have a drink.

433
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Uncle. Uncle.

434
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Drink.

435
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
There's a wine on the mountain.

436
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
There's wine. There's wine.

437
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Here.

438
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
The fruit wine.

439
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
The fruit from the mountain.

440
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
You want to try it?

441
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Try it.

442
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Uncle also likes to drink.

443
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
He'll try it himself.

444
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
He specially made it for you.

445
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
He had it for many days.

446
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Really?

447
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
You must try it.

448
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
It's really good.

449
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Good wine.

450
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
One more bowl.

451
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
You made all these dishes.

452
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
It's Aning.

453
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Aning?

454
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Brother Heitang.

455
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Brother Heitang.

456
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Let's have a drink.

457
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Here.

458
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Drink it up.

459
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Come on.

460
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Have a drink.

461
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Cheers.

462
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Come on.

463
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
Here.

464
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Let's eat.

465
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Come.

466
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Here.

467
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Come on, Uncle Si.

468
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Cheers.

469
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Good wine.

470
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Come again, Uncle Si.

471
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
This won't do.

472
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Come, drink.

473
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
No, it won't do.

474
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
It won't do.

475
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Wen Qing, you're not drinking anymore?

476
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
There are four bottles. Drink slowly.

477
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Don't drink today.

478
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
That's not enough.

479
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
It's what I call

480
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
the life after death.

481
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,720
It's better to drink as soon as possible.

482
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Enjoy your drink.

483
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
You're not strong enough.

484
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
But I think you should drink.

485
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
You're too fierce.

486
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,720
It's not the point of the body.

487
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Why should I drink?

488
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Drink.

489
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Wen Qing.

490
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
When I first met Lan Zhan,

491
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
I was with Tian Zixiao.

492
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I was so confused.

493
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
You didn't see Lan Zhan's expression.

494
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
That face.

495
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
But

496
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Tian Zixiao of Gusu

497
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
is really good.

498
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I don't know

499
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,720
if I can drink it as soon as possible.

500
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
I really don't have any.

501
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I made a secret promise to the world

502
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,720
to hold the most crazy wedding.

503
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
But now,

504
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I can't even attend the wedding.

505
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I really don't have any.

506
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I really don't have any.

507
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
I really don't have any.

508
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
I really don't have any.

509
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
I really don't have any.

510
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
I really don't have any.

511
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I really don't have any.

512
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
I really don't have any.

513
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I really don't have any.

514
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
I really don't have any.

515
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
I really don't have any.

516
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
I really don't have any.

517
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
I really don't have any.

518
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
I really don't have any.

519
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I really don't have any.

520
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I really don't have any.

521
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
I really don't have any.

522
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
I really don't have any.

523
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
I really don't have any.

524
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
I really don't have any.

525
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
I really don't have any.

526
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
I really don't have any.

527
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
I really don't have any.

528
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
I really don't have any.

529
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
I really don't have any.

530
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
I really don't have any.

531
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
I really don't have any.

532
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
I really don't have any.

533
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
I really don't have any.

534
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I really don't have any.

535
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
I really don't have any.

536
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Lei Yuan, якout Looking for theавай

537
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
I really don't have any.

538
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
All for yourself

539
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
No one can avoid you

540
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
You know

541
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,320
What I have

542
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,720
could be the terme of~~

543
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Assume will be the time

544
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Lying and你可以

545
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Some kind of HIV

546
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,440
Isn't it better

547
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,920
to land together

548
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,700
with birds practicing to enjoy the night.

549
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,640
The World Right Away

550
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,760
Episode 60

551
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,200
As you all know,

552
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,540
walking towards the mountain

553
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,900
But it's a mess.

554
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
A mess?

555
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,060
Isn't that the place where the Jiang clan

556
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,380
and the Wei Wuxian clan

557
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,540
live?

558
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Who?

559
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,540
Stop it.

560
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
How dare you go there?

561
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,220
Wei Wuxian

562
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,420
is the most skilled

563
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,220
in training.

564
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,220
Yes.

565
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,980
In the legend,

566
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,540
Wen Ning

567
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,340
is not only fast,

568
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,300
but also powerful and powerful.

569
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,340
And the most terrifying thing is

570
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,420
she is so kind and clear-hearted.

571
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,540
There are many

572
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
things that Wen family did.

573
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,540
How can she be called

574
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
a ghost general?

575
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,820
Brother,

576
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,020
don't blame me for not reminding you.

577
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
What are you going to do?

578
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,180
What if...

579
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,900
Wen Ning...

580
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,700
You don't know.

581
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,180
That Wei Wuxian

582
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,340
created the Ghost Hall.

583
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,740
Including the

584
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,060

00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,860
the famous fire service.

586
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,740
Very interesting.

587
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,820
I heard that many people

588
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,860
have entered his door.

589
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,820
I want to go to the construction site.

590
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,580
Everyone,

591
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,940
look here.

592
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
I am the first big disciple

593
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,500
of the Yiling Lao Tu.

594
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,300
Today,

595
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,660
I will show you

596
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,740
the new Buddha's sign.

597
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,140
Must wait for a while.

598
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,940
Wait.

599
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,100
Dear everyone,

600
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,820
this could not be

601
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,500
the famous fire service

602
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,180
wered at Yifeng Po task.

603
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,620
The expenses for traveling

604
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,900
must be contributed in the next five to eight years .

605
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,100
Each one shall receive one mesha.

606
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,360
Come please, please, everyone!

607
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,560
Wait...

608
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,960
With such conductual seductive underwear,

609
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:50,060
it makes you do your

610
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
Who are you?

611
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Who am I?

612
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,020
I just got out of the mess.

613
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,020
But I've never seen my master

614
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,020
take your land.

615
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
You said I'm fake.

616
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
I said you're fake.

617
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Everyone, please look.

618
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,020
This is my master's latest invention, the talisman.

619
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,020
It's not a famous fire suit.

620
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
It's a small blanket.

621
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
Don't get in the way.

622
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
Nonsense.

623
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Nonsense?

624
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Then get the evidence.

625
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Don't be fooled by him.

626
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
He's a liar.

627
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Who's a liar?

628
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
I'm sure you know.

629
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,020
I'm a big liar.

630
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I'm a big liar.

631
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Don't touch me.

632
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Trust me.

633
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
I'm a big liar.

634
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,020
I'm a big liar.

635
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,020
He's a liar.

636
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
This is my master's latest invention.

637
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
What nonsense.

638
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
Everyone, don't be fooled by him.

639
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Let's go.

640
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
I'm a big liar.

641
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
I'm a big liar.

642
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
I'm a big liar.

I'm a big liar.

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
I'm a big liar.

650
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
I'm a big liar.

651
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
I'm a big liar.

652
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
I'm a big liar.

653
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
I'm a big liar.

654
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020

673
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
What's going on?

674
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,020
What's wrong with you?

675
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,140
Don't worry. It's okay.

676
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,140
Just a minor accident.

677
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,740
Let's go. Let's go.

678
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,260
Continue working.

679
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,140
Forget it. Forget it.

680
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,340
Don't look at me. Continue working.

681
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,460
What are you doing?

682
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,060
A Feng Xie plate.

683
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,340
Very good.

684
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,420
Go buy meat.

685
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Oh.

686
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,020
So much money.

687
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Get this radish.

688
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
I'll buy it.

689
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
Mother.

690
