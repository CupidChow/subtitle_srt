00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 04

3
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,440
Oh, no!

4
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
The salute ceremony is starting.

5
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,540
The natural world

6
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
is the origin of everything.

7
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,040
The devotion to creeds of Lan

8
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
plays a decisive role.

9
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,720
Clear reason, inquire doubt, state opinion, summarize wits.

10
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
The four

11
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,280
should admonish you.

12
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes, master.

13
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
The three thousand five hundred principles of Lan.

14
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Say don't take crooked ways.

15
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
Don't use concealed weapon unauthorized.

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
Don't take apprentices excessively,

17
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,040
nor pass on to ordinary people.

18
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,200
Don't keep secret edge tool.

19
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,800
Change clothing after shower.

20
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
Wearing headband is to discipline yourself.

21
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,840
Don't touch others' headband without permission.

22
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,600
headband is not for other purpose.

23
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Don't wear any jangling objects like beads.

24
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,400
No more than three accessories around your waist.

25
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
Don't alter clothes secretly.

26
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
Don't arbitrarily move.

27
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,160
There are more than three thousand principles.

28
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,440
It can't be finished up for hours.

29
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,680
Don't keep suspicion.

30
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Behave yourself and don't make wild guesses of others.

31
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,200
Don't slander others.

32
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,840
Don't use coarse language.

33
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,640
Don't be ill-mannered.

34
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,520
Don't sow discord.

35
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,240
Don't go back on your word.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,270
Honour the teachers and respect the elders.

37
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,880
In case the senior stands, you can't sit.

38
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,200
Sit after their sitting.

39
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Teachers are of extensive knowledge and examples are of moral integrity.

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
What rare bird did you hide inside.

41
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,320
Frugality for morality.

42
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,200
Don't be luxurious.

43
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't indulge in pleasure.

44
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't be tufthunting.

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
Don't be social climbers.

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
What's this?

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,480
I found a canary on the way.

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
I've followed it for whole 3 days.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,960
How do you think?

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
Isn't it wonderful?

51
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,920
Quite interesting.

52
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,720
And with golden feathers.

53
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Indeed.

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
Tell you what.

55
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
It's even more amusing.

56
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,760
For example...

57
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
Don't be supercilious.

58
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Don't be aggressive.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,680
Don't despise poverty.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
Don't bully others.

61
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,200
Cordial and courteous, modest and humble.

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Hide wisdom and do not show off your skills.

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,040
The fuddy-duddy is so vengeful.

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
Don't neglect your studies.

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,640
Jin clan of Lanling is saluting.

66
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm Jin Zixuan from Jin clan of Lanling. Here to visit the master.

67
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,840
I know the master disdains vulgarian

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
with your vast knowledge.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,400
My father especially collected classics for the master.

70
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,760
A set of edited Helo management books

71
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,440
which consists of gold string,

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
I hope this will gratify the master.

73
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,680
How luxury.

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,280
But meretricious.

75
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Quit it.

76
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Nie clan of Qinghe is saluting.

77
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,040
Nie Huaisang from Nie clan of Qinghe here to visit the master.

78
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
To represent Nie clan.

79
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,440
I'll present the dark-red sand elixir pot.

80
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,560
Mengyao.

81
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,720
Assistant Meng Yao from Nie clan of Qinghe.

82
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,660
here to present the dark-red sand elixir pot in behalf of our Clan Leader Nie.

83
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,870
= Meng Yao =
here to present the dark-red sand elixir pot in behalf of our Clan Leader Nie.

84
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,480
here to present the dark-red sand elixir pot in behalf of our Clan Leader Nie.

85
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
The dark-red sand is antique and solemn,

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
plain but profound.

87
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,160
Just like the quality of Master Lan.

88
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,880
Who is he?

89
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,080
I hope the master would accept it.

90
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,400
He is that Meng Yao

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,520
He is the love child of Clan Leader Jin,right?

92
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,960
It was said that he went to Jin clan for proposal,

93
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,280
only to be kicked down from the Jinlintai.

94
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,920
After that he became the follower of Nie clan.

95
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Both as the children of Clan Leader Jin,

96
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,960
they are treated so differently like one is in heaven,

97
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,040
and one is in hell.

98
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,840
Quiet!

99
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,920
I have heard that Clan Leader Nie has a helpful assistant.

100
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,000
Having seen the elegance of your speech today,

101
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,120
that's indeed as my expection.

102
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,480
The dark-red pot looks uncommon,

103
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
surely in accordance with Mr Lan's preference.

104
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,240
Thank you, Master Zewu.

105
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,370
= Wen Chao from Wen clan of Qishan =

106
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,570
= Wen Ning, courtesy name is Qionglin =

107
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
Childe, please present your invitation.

108
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,360
Invitation?

109
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,680
No invitation, no entry to the Cloud Recesses.

110
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,920
No passing jade pendant, no entry.

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Coming late, no entry.

112
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
This is the invitation of Wen clan of Qishan.

113
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,120
Help me!

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
His Excellency has ordered

115
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
me to investigate secretly.

116
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Let the sleeping dog lie.

117
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,360
We'd better not display.

118
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Wen Qing,

119
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,040
minor clans like you guys are always over-cautious.

120
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,840
I tell you,

121
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,840
talking about Wen clan of Qishan,

122
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,680
this is far from a display.

123
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm Jiang Cheng or Jiang Wanyin from Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

124
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,800
We follow the orders of father...

125
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
By far,

126
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,920
do I know

127
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,320
the gate of Lan clan is so hard to enter.

128
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,360
Not knowing Childe Wen would come,

129
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,080
we Lan clan should apologize.

130
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
In the recent century,

131
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,680
Wen clan has never attended the lecture of Lan.

132
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,360
Is Childe Wen coming here

133
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
to relay any advice from His Excellency?

134
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,040
Clan Leader Lan

135
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
You are wrong.

136
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm not here for the lecture.

137
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm just escorting someone here.

138
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,600
Besides,

139
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,440
Wenclan of Qishan is always educating others.

140
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Surely we have no need for the lecture of yours.

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
He's so arrogant.

142
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,560
In that case,

143
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,240
why did Childe Wen come here?

144
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,560
Who is this hangdog?

145
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
I can't deserve 'hangdog'.

146
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,400
Wei Wuxian from Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

147
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,280
Even a nobody dare interrupt me.

148
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,200
My brother Jiang Cheng was saluting just now.

149
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,760
How can you shout and yell like this?

150
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,520
This is how you Wen clan of Qishan

151
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,680
educate others?

152
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,400
OK.

153
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,600
Today I will show you how our Wen Family of Qishan

154
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,360
settle with those who don't listen.

155
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,320
Childe Wen.

156
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Just one word not right,

157
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
why are you so aggressive?

158
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,960
Jiang clan of Yunmeng is unaware of etiquette.

159
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,640
If I don't give you a lesson,

160
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,080
people will say we don't stick to our principles.

161
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
The Jade Twin of Lan,

162
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,400
really deserve the reputation.

163
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,520
Childe Wen,

164
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,880
today is the ceremony day of Cloud Recesses.

165
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I hope Childe Wen could restrain yourself.

166
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,680
I'm Wen Qing from Wen clan of Qishan.

167
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm under orders of His Excellency to attend the lecture.

168
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,000
I, Wen Qing, and my little brother,Wen Ning,

169
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,760
are the first time to be in the Cloud Recesses

170
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,080
and not familiar with the rules.

171
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,760
Hope Mr Lan and Clan Leader Lan could forgive us.

172
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,000
If so,

173
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll accept it.

174
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,280
Childe Wen,

175
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,680
salute ceremony is done.

176
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Please have a rest in our guest house.

177
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
As for tomorrow's lecture,

178
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,800
Please come here on time.

179
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,480
Wen clan of Qishan should have sent someone for the lecture.

180
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,480
That's rare.

181
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
And even made their Second Childe Wen Chao as escort.

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,920
Wen Chao

183
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,120
is usually disrespectful and bossy.

184
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,160
He's even more than that from what I saw today.

185
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,880
So,

186
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,720
Bro Wei, you are so great.

187
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,600
You dared to face out Wen Chao.

188
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Except you,

189
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,840
there is no one else.

190
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,240
Why should we be afraid of him?

191
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
Resisting such evil guys

192
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,960
is an endless joy.

193
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,360
Bro Wei,

194
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,040
I wish to have the courage like you.

195
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,280
The courage of him

196
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,120
is really not something common people can compare with.

197
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,160
Let me tell you.

198
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
Before improving your courage,

199
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
you should learn how to play.

200
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,600
Play?

201
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,560
how to play?

202
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
I can teach you.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,320
How about we play all around the Cloud Recesses

204
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,200
inside out?

205
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
There is a stream in the back hill.

206
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,600
We could catch some fish together.

207
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
Bro Wei, are you serious?

208
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,120
Of course.

209
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,680
Come on, don't mislead him.

210
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,360
Wei Wuxian,

211
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,840
tomorrow is the official lecture.

212
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Do not forget.

213
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,200
You still have 260 copies of principles to transcribe.

214
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
Again.

215
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Can you stop mentioning that?

216
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,840
Bro Jin, I heard Lan clan...

217
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,400
Bro Ji! Bro Ji!

218
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,160
It's me. Me!

219
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,120
He didn't hear me. I'm sure.

220
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,120
Bad hearing

221
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,840
Bro Wei

222
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,320
You even dare to provoke the famous Lan Zhan,

223
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,440
the Second Childe of Lan Clan.

224
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,110
Long as I am in Lan clan,

225
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
I can only avoid him in every encounter.

226
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,440
It's not a big deal.

227
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,200
Tell you what.

228
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,480
I even fought him last night.

229
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,920
You fought with the Lan Wangji?

230
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,560
Bro Wei you are really reckless.

231
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Look,

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,040
you didn't know,

233
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,560
how fierce it was last night.

234
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,800
On that tranquil night I climbed over the wall

235
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,360
carrying a pot of Emperor's Smile.

236
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
But he...

237
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,120
Uncle.

238
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,480
Since the first lecture of Lan,

239
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,680
Wen clan has never sent their disciples here.

240
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,240
Though they just sent

241
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,920
a pair of collateral siblings of Wen this time.

242
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
They may have some ulterior motives.

243
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,600
Xichen, whoever come are guests.

244
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,640
No matter what intention they have,

245
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
what we need to do is to treat them with due respect

246
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,160
and beware of them.

247
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,120
Uncle is right.

248
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,080
Xichen,

249
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,080
you still have worries.

250
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,400
Yes, uncle.

251
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,360
I am just thinking.

252
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,840
Wen clan can channel fire

253
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
and those puppets...

254
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,640
Aren't there any relations?

255
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Ever since Clan Leader Wen was succeeded as His Excellency.

256
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
Their behaviors are getting more perverse.

257
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Their manor, the Nevernight, is like a city

258
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,480
with countless guests and retainers.

259
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,320
In recent years

260
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,360
they are getting out of control and bullying the weak.

261
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
If the spirit taking event

262
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,280
relates to His Excellency,

263
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,280
I'm afraid it'll become something

264
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,640
that we two could not decide.

265
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,320
Clan Leader Lan.

266
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,800
Childe Meng.

267
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,680
Childe Meng, the salute ceremony is done.

268
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
Why not go back to have a rest?

269
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,160
I mean to bid you a farewell.

270
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,440
Farewell?

271
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,800
Why not stay for several days before departure?

272
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm just a guest of Nie clan, not a disciple.

273
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,360
I'd better not stay for too long.

274
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,520
If so,

275
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,120
I can't urge you to stay.

276
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,800
Childe Meng.

277
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,280
Clan Leader Nie is frank and forthright,

278
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
and knows when to punish or reward.

279
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
If there's any contributor,

280
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,280
he will treat him fairly.

281
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,840
I'll note your words.

282
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
Thanks a lot for your help on the salute ceremony just now.

283
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
You are welcome.

284
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,680
We are peers.

285
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,840
No need to thank me like this.

286
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,960
Please forgive me leaving.

287
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,120
What a funny day.

288
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,160
Indeed.

289
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,000
Here I come...

290
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,600
Bro Wei!

291
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,880
You frightened away the fish!

292
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,760
OK, OK, you go on.

293
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,000
Give me, give me, give me.

294
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,080
Throw it to me! Throw it to me!

295
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,760
Give me, give me, give me

296
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,280
Bro Nie,

297
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,160
it's OK that you can't help.

298
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,720
But I finally caught a fish for you.

299
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,240
You should let it escape!

300
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,680
I have to say, Bro Wei,

301
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,240
there are mountains but rivers back in my home Qinhe,

302
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,840
which is different from  your home Yunmeng

303
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,640
lakes and rivers everywhere.

304
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,120
Besides,

305
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
we have magic tricks.

306
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,120
Why should we catch the fish ourselves?

307
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,000
Magic tricks for catching fish?

308
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,480
That's boring.

309
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,680
You let me take you to play all around Gusu.

310
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,680
Aren't climbing mountains and wading in rivers a part of that?

311
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,320
What you said

312
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,160
makes sense to me.

313
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Then let's continue.

314
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,000
Quiet. Shh.

315
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,920
So many fish here, Nie Bro

316
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
Help, help!

317
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,160
Help me, Bro Wei!

318
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,240
Help…

319
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Wei Wuxian, I...

320
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Fish, fish, fish!

321
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,880
Look at your back!

322
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,480
back, back

323
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,640
You see, a fish behind you

324
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,120
The left, the left. Beside you.

325
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Bro Wei. Bro Wei.

326
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,720
Bro Wei!

327
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,520
Miss Wen.

328
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,680
Miss Wen.

329
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,160
Why are you here?

330
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
Your silver needle looks pretty good.

331
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,120
Don't touch it.

332
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,080
Did anybody ever tell you?

333
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,840
never touch the silver needle of a doctor?

334
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
I have only heard that

335
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,480
there is a female doctor in Wen clan

336
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
who are cruel and merciless

337
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,000
and people can't approach her.

338
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Miss Wen.

339
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,920
You haven't answered me.

340
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,160
why you are here?

341
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,360
The back hill of the Cloud Recesses can't be visited randomly.

342
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
You can't be taking a walk,

343
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,680
but for some decent reasons, right?

344
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,120
Then what's your business here?

345
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,400
Me? My business is pretty serious.

346
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,080
Catching fish.

347
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,320
Cheng, don't exhaust yourself.

348
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,960
Tomorrow is the official lecture.

349
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,680
These days in Gusu,

350
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,440
Wei Wuxian is always making others worried.

351
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,520
We won't be this idle later on.

352
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Let him go.

353
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,200
When can he think more for Jiang clan of Yunmeng?

354
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,560
Cheng,

355
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,760
our ancestors of Jiang clan

356
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,360
were rangers

357
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,280
advocating frank actions

358
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,320
and unrestrained minds.

359
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,680
That's exactly Xian's personality.

360
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,680
You don't need to worry too much.

361
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,600
This is why

362
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,560
father always favors him.

363
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Cheng,

364
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
any disciple of Jiang

365
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,240
who has moral integrity

366
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,920
will be favored by father, isn't it?

367
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,560
Besides,

368
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,120
you are the same.

369
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,880
Keep nagging him,

370
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,640
but actually you are concerned about him.

371
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm not.

372
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,920
Both of you are here.

373
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,800
Again you…

374
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,680
Keep it down.

375
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,360
Sis, you see.

376
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,120
I...

377
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,060
Senior Sister,

378
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,850
the freshly roasted fish with vegetable soup

379
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,580
is the best match.

380
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,180
You're not eating, are you?

381
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,580
Then I eat them all.

382
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,100
Come on.

383
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,670
Hey, you stubborn.

384
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,530
Last chance.

385
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,280
If you don't eat it, there will be no fish.

386
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,070
Who do you call stubborn?

387
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,210
Whoever won't compromise is stubborn.

388
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,100
You...

389
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,010
All right, you two.

390
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,920
Cheng.

391
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,050
Xian.

392
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,800
After the official lecture tomorrow,

393
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,620
you have to stop messing around.

394
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,770
I promise.

395
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,750
Just like Mrs. Yu said,

396
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,020
I won't make any trouble.

397
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,000
Have some soup.

398
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,250
Childe Jin.

399
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,550
After you.

400
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,150
Get in already!

401
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,630
The sixth rule,

402
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,970
Accumulate virtue and merits.

403
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,220
Be compassionate.

404
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,400
Be loyal, filial, friendly and dutiful.

405
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,870
Correcting others by correcting yourself.

406
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,100
Take pity on the desolate, help the lonely,

407
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,620
respect the elderly, and care for the weak.

408
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,600
Never hurt insects or plants.

409
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,550
Be sad for other people's sufferings, and rejoice in their blessings.

410
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,800
Lend a hand in need, and rescue those in danger.

411
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,300
Regard other people's gain as own gain

412
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,440
and their loss as own loss.

413
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,500
Speak not about other people's weaknesses,

414
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,420
or boast about own strengths.

415
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,350
Resist the evil, promote the good.

416
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,020
Give more, take less.

417
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,130
Be peaceful when insulted.

418
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,050
Be grateful when praised.

419
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,470
Don't expect rewards after offering.

420
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,350
Don't regret after offering.

421
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,590
Good people will be esteemed,

422
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,750
blessed by the nature, accompanied by good fortune.

423
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,370
Suppress and eliminate ghosts and monsters

424
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,900
is to liberate them.

425
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,500
What?

426
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,380
Stop laughing!

427
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,840
Eliminate the evil and establish a just law.

428
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,570
Once become a disciple of Lan clan,

429
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,970
must follow the principles of Lan.

430
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,300
Sitting improperly is prohibited.

431
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,570
Running is prohibited.

432
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,430
Causing noise is prohibited.

433
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,370
Bullying and teasing others is prohibited.

434
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,970
Ignoring others and being undisciplined is prohibited.

435
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,220
Borrowing money is prohibited.

436
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,550
Being late is prohibited.

437
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,670
Wei Ying.

438
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,930
Here, master.

439
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,170
Now that you don't need my lecture.

440
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,510
let me ask you.

441
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,640
Are imp, demons, ghosts, and monsters the same things?

442
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,170
No.

443
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,470
Why not?  How are they differentiated?

444
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,370
Imp are formed from living, non-human beings;

445
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,500
Demons are formed from living humans;

446
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,520
Ghosts are formed from dead humans;

447
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,250
Monsters are formed from dead, non-human beings.

448
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,620
'imp' and 'monsters' are often confused.

449
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,450
Give me an example.

450
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,170
That's easy.

451
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,170
For example, if that tree behind you

452
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,870
is tainted by your energy of principles,

453
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,680
and cultivate into a conscious being

454
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,700
then causing trouble,

455
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,770
it would be a 'imp' .

456
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,020
If I took an axe and cut it in the middle,

457
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,170
so that's only a dead tree-stump left,

458
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,400
and then it cultivates into a being,

459
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,570
it would be a 'monster'.

460
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,870
What was the profession of the ancestors of Nie clan?

461
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,600
Butcher.

462
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,950
The heraldry of the Jin clan is a white peony.

463
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,580
Which type of white peony?

464
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,280
Sparks Amidst Snow.

465
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,360
Who was the first in the cultivation world

466
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,320
to focus on the rise of his clan rather than his section?

467
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,820
The progenitor of Wen clan,

468
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,650
Wen Mao.

469
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,210
As a disciple of Jiang clan,

470
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,270
you should have already been very familiar with these

471
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,250
and known them by heart.

472
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,520
It's nothing to be proud of that you answered them correctly.

473
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,700
Let me ask you again.

474
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,720
There is an executioner

475
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,720
with parents, a wife, and children,

476
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,890
but he has executed more than one hundred people.

477
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,320
Now he suddenly dies in the public and,

478
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,620
his body is left alone for seven days.

479
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,450
With the repressed energy of resentment,

480
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,900
he started to haunt and kill.

481
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,100
What should be done?

482
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,270
Don' t open your books!

483
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,130
Think about this by yourselves!

484
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,520
WangJi,

485
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,470
you tell him what should be done.

486
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,250
There are three ways.

487
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,770
First, liberate; second, suppress; third, eliminate.

488
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,430
First try to move it with its family

489
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,230
and grant his dying wish, set him free from his obsessiveness.

490
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,520
If it fails, suppress it.

491
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,320
If guilty as hell,

492
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,370
and its hatred does not relieve,

493
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,520
then exterminate it completely.

494
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,810
The cultivation world should stick to this order of measures.

495
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,860
No errors should be allowed.

496
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,710
Not even one word is wrong.

497
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,220
No matter in terms of cultivation or as a person,

498
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,170
one needs to be as solid as him.

499
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,740
If one becomes complacent and proud just because

500
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,220
they defeated a few simple mountain beings in their home

501
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,920
and hold some empty reputations,

502
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,650
one would definitely bring disgrace upon themselves, sooner or later.

503
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,950
Master,

504
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,400
I have a question.

505
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,340
Speak.

506
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,700
Although 'liberation' comes first, it is often impossible.

507
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,750
'To grant his dying wish'sounds simple.

508
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,360
It would be easy, if the wish was a new piece of clothing,

509
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,350
but what if the wish was to kill lots of people for revenge?

510
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,200
Thus, suppression assists liberation.

511
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,270
If it is necessary, elimination would also follow.

512
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,430
Such a waste.

513
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,260
I actually knew the answer, but however

514
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,700
I was just thinking of a fourth path.

515
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,100
I have never heard of any fourth path.

516
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,000
What‘s your solution?

517
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,600
Because the executioner died abruptly,

518
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,350
it's only natural that he turned into a ghost.

519
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Since he executed more than one hundred people before he died,

520
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,120
why not dig up the graves of these people,

521
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,250
arouse their resentment,

522
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,570
collect the hundred heads,

523
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,950
and use them to fight with the ghost?

524
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,600
How dare you!

525
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,110
The essence of exorcising demons and annihilating ghosts is to liberate!

526
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,280
You do not study the methods of liberation,

527
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,350
and even think about increasing their resentment!

528
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,160
You reverse the natural order,

529
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,170
and ignore ethics and morality!

530
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,500
Master, there are some things that are not suitable for liberation,

531
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,560
so why not find a way to make use of them?

532
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,850
When Yu the Great tamed the flood,

533
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,100
obstruction was the inferior method, and redirection was the superior.

534
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,170
Suppression is the same as obstruction, so isn't it inferior...

535
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,500
Master.

536
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,050
Spiritual energy is energy; resentful energy is energy as well.

537
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,320
Spiritual energy is in our Pubes.

538
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,200
It can split mountains and fill oceans,

539
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,900
available for human use.

540
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,710
If so, then why can't resentful energy also be used by humans?

541
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,530
Then, let me ask you again!

542
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,520
How do you make sure that the resentful energy

543
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,580
only listens to you and does not harm others?

544
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,620
I haven' t thought of it yet!

545
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,350
If you thought of it,

546
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,350
the cultivation world would not allow your existence!

547
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,210
Get out!

548
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,800
Go to the Library Pavilion

549
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,720
and copy the Chapter of Conduct a thousand times!

550
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Xian.

551
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,600
Wangji,

552
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,150
you take him to the library.

553
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,600
He can't leave without a thousand copies.

554
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,980
Yes, master.

555
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,870
Childe Wen, you're good at archery!

556
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm sorry that I scared you.

557
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,850
Brother Wen, you' re skilled at archery!

558
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,920
Why didn't I see you at the Qingtan Fair?

559
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,900
You flatter me.

560
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,620
I'm not so good at it,

561
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,230
and I shall ask you for more advice.

562
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,370
You overstate it.

563
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,210
I think you're gifted. Ordinary people can't compare with you.

564
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,020
Let' s learn from each other' s strong points and close the gap.

565
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,470
By the way, Brother Wen,

566
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,600
why do you practice alone in this lonely place,

567
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,050
but don't attend the lecture?

568
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,370
I... I'm still young.

569
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,220
I'm not qualified to have classes.

570
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,100
Childe Wei.

571
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
Why are you here?

572
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,010
Well...

573
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,110
To tell the truth,

574
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,160
I just got kicked out by Master Lan.

575
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,720
It's a long story.

576
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
Forget about it.

577
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,920
I just saw you shooting an arrow.

578
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,220
Your strength is enough, but the posture can be better.

579
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,620
How about this?

580
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,970
I'll adjust it for you.

581
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,820
Okay.

582
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,680
Come on.

583
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,960
Keep your hands down.

584
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,400
Straighten the forearm. Open the shoulder.

585
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,250
Bend your Legs.

586
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,950
Aim at the target.

587
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,450
Aim down a little bit.

588
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:39,980
Up a little bit.

589
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,110
Okay, keep aiming at the target.

590
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,780
Wen Ning.

591
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,670
Sis.

592
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,470
Why are you with him?

593
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,110
This is Childe Wei.

594
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,000
He's a nice person.

595
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,500
He's instructing me the archery.

596
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,460
Miss Wen.

597
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,410
I haven't asked you yet.

598
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,960
Why do I always see you in the back hill?

599
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,380
Are you always following me secretly?

600
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,620
Or

601
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,180
you are looking for something in the back hill of Lan clan?

602
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,400
Wei Wuxian!

603
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,420
Stop talking nonsense.

604
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,350
Is there really a secret in the back hill of Cloud Recesses?

605
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,800
Brother Ji, it's you.
