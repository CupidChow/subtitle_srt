00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 13

3
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,240
Lan Zhan.

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
How is your leg?

5
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
Fine.

6
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Lan Zhan.

7
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,560
After all we've been through together,

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,000
is there anything you can't share?

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,440
Your leg is OK for sure?

10
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Fine.

11
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,320
Don't pretend it's fine in every case.

12
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
How about

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
let me carry you?

14
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,280
Boring.

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,480
Hey!

16
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,640
Lan Zhan, you...

17
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,400
Such a stubborn fool.

18
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,680
He just walk like this,

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,720
which will compound the wound.

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,560
Miss Wen, it's me.

21
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
You don't need to answer.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Just listen.

23
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
I just want to tell something.

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,560
Thanks for your help last night.

25
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,320
I know

26
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
you have your own bane.

27
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
But now I have another request.

28
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
Miss Wen, please.

29
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,880
Could you figure out some way to let Lan Zhan take a rest?

30
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,640
Halt.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
We will take a rest here.

32
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,960
Go drink some water.

33
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Wei Wuxian, what do you want again?

34
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Nothing special.

35
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,760
Lan Zhan, I'll go fetch you some water.

36
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,240
How considerate you are for certain people.

37
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,680
You don't want them tired even a bit.

38
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,440
You think too much.

39
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,760
It'd better be that.

40
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,080
Wen Qing.

41
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Don't blame me for not having warned you.

42
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
You may not think for yourself.

43
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,760
But you should think for your dear little brother.

44
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Don't mess with me.

45
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Get up and be on our way, you all!

46
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,800
It must be here.

47
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
You shall go find

48
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
the cave where lives the monster

49
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,160
before it's dark,

50
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,000
or you'll have a rough time.

51
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,360
Childe.

52
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,240
Who is that woman?

53
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,840
Bossing us around.

54
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
She?

55
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
She was just a maiden of

56
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,120
Wen Chao's principal wife.

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
For her pretty look,

58
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
Wen Chao soon had an affair with her.

59
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,120
Not capable.

60
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,040
Quiet bossy because of Wen Chao.

61
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,880
No wonder she is like a servant of Wen clan.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,560
Carrying only a hot iron but a sword.

63
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
Her spiritual power is

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
too scarce to carry a sword.

65
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,880
You!

66
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
What are you doing here?

67
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,000
Childe Wen ordered you to find the cave

68
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,720
not to have some secret talk.

69
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
Childe, we've searched everywhere.

70
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,200
No cave is found.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,880
No cave?

72
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
All useless.

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
A bunch of waste.

74
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,160
What you gonna do?

75
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
The cave!

76
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
Childe Wen, congratulations!

77
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,040
Come on! Let's get in!

78
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,720
Come on! Let's get in!

79
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,440
What are you looking for? Hurry up!

80
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,160
Mianmian!

81
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Are you OK?

82
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,720
Wen Chao, what you just did?

83
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,200
What I did?

84
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,800
What are you yelling about?

85
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,160
Should the monster be disturbed,

86
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,800
how could you be responsible for that?

87
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,760
You bring us here,

88
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
claiming that we're hunting some monster.

89
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,360
So please tell me, what on earth is the monsterï¼Ÿ

90
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,400
You didn't inform us of anything

91
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,160
and took away our swords,

92
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
which makes us wrong-footed.

93
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
Inform you?

94
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,800
How many times I have to say before you can remember?

95
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,280
Don't get it wrong.

96
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
You...

97
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,800
are nothing but my dogs.

98
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,880
I am the one that commands.

99
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,600
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

100
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,760
I am the one that gives orders and deploy you.

101
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Only I can be the one that represses the monster.

102
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
What are you looking at?

103
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
Hurry the hell up.

104
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
Yes, it's here.

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,600
Go! Get down there!

106
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,800
It seems bottomless.

107
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,720
And not knowing what monster is there.

108
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
You don't make it clear.

109
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,120
How can we get down there?

110
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,000
Wei Ying!

111
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
Take care here.

112
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
Come, careful.

113
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,120
Are you OK?

114
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
You are kicked down too?

115
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,360
Beat it.

116
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,280
We just worried that you were ate up by the monster

117
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,520
and brought shame on our Jiang clan.

118
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
Leaving these two alone,

119
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,120
you can't be as well afraid

120
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,640
that I was ate up, can you?

121
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,920
I'd come down to fight

122
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,840
that monster

123
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
rather than see that mean couple insult us.

124
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
I understand.

125
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,240
Hey!

126
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,120
Anything unusual?

127
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,480
Hey!

128
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,520
You've died out already?

129
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,920
How can you be as silent as dead?

130
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,200
What's going on?

131
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
Anyone still alive

132
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,560
shall response immediately!

133
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,520
Or I'll make you suffer!

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Listen, the echo.

135
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,240
We are hundreds meters away from the outside.

136
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,000
Something wrong.

137
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,880
Childe, a dead end.

138
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,920
Impossible.

139
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,040
Keep searching

140
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,240
carefully.

141
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,400
Yes.

142
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,080
You guys

143
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,000
get somebody hung and bleeding

144
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
to lure that thing out.

145
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,760
Nonsense!

146
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,800
Luring that thing with flesh and blood

147
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,480
means leaving us to die!

148
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,160
What?

149
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,160
Childe Jin, you want to try it yourself?

150
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,880
Make an example for us?

151
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,280
- You... - Childe!

152
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,600
If I say, how about her?

153
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
Her?

154
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
Maybe another one.

155
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
Why?

156
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,640
You feel reluctant for

157
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,240
she is pretty?

158
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,720
Nonsense.

159
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,080
What am I reluctant about?

160
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,320
It's your call.

161
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Get aside!

162
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,520
Don't you understand human language?

163
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,240
Or want to be the hero here?

164
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Enough!

165
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,000
You used us as your buffer.

166
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,800
Now you want to use us as your flesh bait.

167
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,320
It didn't occur to me that the Jin Zixuan can be quiet brave.

168
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
You want to rebel, huh?

169
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,720
I warn you

170
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,160
I've been putting up with you for long.

171
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,520
You'd better tie the girl up

172
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,320
yourself right here and now,

173
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,920
or

174
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,560
all you guys from whatever clans

175
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,040
won't be able to return.

176
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
Such a shame disciples like you are from Jin clan.

177
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
How disgraceful.

178
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,280
Judging from the situation,

179
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,760
we might not be able to stay out of this.

180
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,240
Rebels.

181
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
You rebels.

182
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Attack!

183
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Childe!

184
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
What are you daring to disobey me?

185
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,200
You shall all be executed.

186
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
You're right.

187
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,840
Those who count on their clan

188
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
and do evil at will

189
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,040
shall all be executed.

190
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,920
What did you say?

191
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,200
You want me to repeat?

192
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,640
I'll repeat then.

193
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
Those who count on their clan

194
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,280
and do evil at will

195
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,880
shall all be executed.

196
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,960
Not only to be executed  but also decapitated

197
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,880
and reviled by the people

198
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,480
to warn the future generations.

199
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,830
You got it?

200
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,440
How dare you say such

201
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,350
outrageous bullshit!

202
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,310
What?

203
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
Outrageous? Bullshit?

204
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,760
Aren't you talking about yourself?

205
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,640
Wen Chao.

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,680
Did you know who said that sentence?

207
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
That's written in your clan's

208
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,000
"The Quintessence of Wens"

209
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,200
by crystal clear.

210
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,800
That was said by

211
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
your progenitor the great great great gentry

212
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,480
Wen Mao.

213
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,560
You should have called your progenitor's words

214
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,640
as outrageous bullshit.

215
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
Good. Beautiful!

216
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,080
Bravo! Excellent!

217
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Brilliant!

218
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,960
Oh, right.

219
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,240
What's the crime of insulting Wen's gentries?

220
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
If I'm right,

221
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,040
it should be execution without sentence,

222
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,840
right?

223
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,080
Very well.

224
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,480
You can die now.

225
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,360
Wei Wuxian!

226
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,080
Stop there!

227
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,080
Childe!

228
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,040
Don't move

229
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,280
or I'll let out some of your Childe's blood.

230
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,120
Stop!

231
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,920
Wei Wuxian! Release him!

232
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,440
Don't... don't move!

233
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,480
Listen to Childe Wei.

234
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,160
Wei Wuxian.

235
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't act rashly.

236
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,320
Everybody put down weapons.

237
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,000
Cores Melter.

238
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,640
Don't you move now!

239
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,800
You should be familiar with your clan leader.

240
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,520
Your childe is at my mercy.

241
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
If he bleeds even one drop,

242
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,840
every one here including you

243
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,240
won't get away with this.

244
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,640
Jiang Cheng!

245
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
Earthquake!

246
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,840
No.

247
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not the earth quaking.

248
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
It's something beneath you!

249
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,000
The Hush!

250
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Its sight is bad.

251
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't make sounds. It won't attack us.

252
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,640
Save me!  Wen Zhuliu!

253
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,960
Asshole.

254
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,800
Let's leave!

255
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,000
Stop pestering us!

256
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,080
Be careful.

257
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Childe, be careful!

258
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
Look out!

259
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,000
What do you want?

260
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,360
Help!

261
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,920
Go save Jiaojiao! Now!

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Jiaojiao! Jiaojiao!

263
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,960
Does it hurt?

264
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
Are you hurt? Jiaojiao?

265
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,800
Draw back!

266
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,880
Everyone attack!

267
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,080
Hurry up!

268
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,960
Everyone here?

269
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,800
Cut the ropes.

270
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,920
- Wait! - Let's go!

271
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,080
No!

272
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,240
Lan Zhan! Jiang Cheng!

273
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,320
Withdraw! Back to the entrance!

274
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,960
Quick!

275
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,520
Shameless bastards.

276
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,040
They cut all ropes.

277
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,960
The Wens did this.

278
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,880
Who else can it be?

279
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,480
Without swords

280
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,800
what can we do?

281
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,120
Stop!

282
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,080
Don't!

283
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,320
Stop that!

284
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,080
You stop! Stop!

285
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,960
Hurry it up!

286
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,520
You helpless trash!

287
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,840
Stop! They will die!

288
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,960
It's OK they will die.

289
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,560
Wen Chao.

290
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,160
You doing this

291
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,320
make it difficult for your father to face the main clans.

292
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,880
Don't you intimidate me with my father.

293
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,600
The other clans are nothing.

294
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,160
They are bound to be wiped out by us

295
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,120
soon or later.

296
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,840
We just make up an excuse when we are back.

297
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,360
Just say they had an accident

298
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,160
in the night hunt.

299
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,600
Who can do anything to me?

300
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,760
Let's go.

301
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,000
We'll collect their corpses after two days.

302
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,520
The mean couple! How could they!

303
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
It's alright we can't get out.

304
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,800
My parents will come to find me.

305
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
If they hear about this,

306
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,640
they will definitely find this place.

307
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,680
They must be assuming we are still in Qishan.

308
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,240
How can they find here?

309
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,120
What's more. After the Wens return,

310
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,760
they can't be honest.

311
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,360
They will make up some excuse.

312
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,120
We are trapped in the cave now.

313
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,560
So we are trapped in the cave

314
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,920
without food

315
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,360
and accompanied by a monster?

316
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,280
Jiang Cheng.

317
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,960
Jiang Cheng.

318
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,200
Jiang Cheng. Do you want meat?

319
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,440
I have cooked meat here. Eat or not?

320
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,280
Get lost!

321
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,600
Haven't the hot iron killed you?

322
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Look at the situation!

323
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,080
I'd really like seaming your mouth.

324
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,120
I'm sorry.

325
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,120
I'm sorry.

326
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Mianmian. Mianmian, don't cry!

327
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,400
I got scalded, not you.

328
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,520
That hurts much.

329
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,480
Can you say something to soothe me?

330
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,320
Jiang Cheng, do something to comfort her.

331
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,880
I didn't make her cry.

332
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
Don't cry.

333
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,800
Second Childe Lan.

334
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,080
Where are you going?

335
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,920
That monster is still guarding the black pond.

336
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,280
Back to pond.

337
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
There's a way out.

338
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,600
What way?

339
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,680
Maple leaves.

340
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,600
Right.

341
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,160
There are maple leaves in the pond

342
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
not in the cave.

343
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
This means there is a exit in the bottom of the pond

344
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
which connects to the outer water.

345
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,920
So the maple leaves

346
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
are carried inside through that.

347
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
But how can we know

348
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,120
how big is the hole?

349
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,160
Is it possible to get through?

350
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,280
What if it's small

351
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
or just a crack?

352
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,640
And that monster

353
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,080
is still guarding and won't leave.

354
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,000
But

355
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,880
we shall move since there is chance.

356
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,920
It's much better than

357
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
sitting here for your parents.

358
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,560
We can just lure it way

359
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,200
if it guards there.

360
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,960
There is a hole! Quiet big!

361
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,320
How big?

362
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,040
5 or 6 people for one time.

363
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
Everyone listen up!

364
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,920
Follow the Jiang Cheng to get through the hole!

365
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,840
The healthy carry the injured!

366
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,560
Who can swim carry who can't!

367
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
5 or 6 people for a time. Don't rush it!

368
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,240
Now!

369
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,600
Duck!

370
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Childe, let's go.

371
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
Quick! Quick!

372
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,040
Come here!

373
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,400
Coming soon!

374
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,880
Quick!

375
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,120
Stay silent!

376
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,040
Hurry!

377
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,040
Come!

378
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,040
Quick!

379
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,560
- We gonna go! - Wei Wuxian!

380
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,600
Look out!

381
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,600
Let's go!

382
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,240
Jiang Cheng! Find somebody to rescue us!

383
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,000
Wei Wuxian!

384
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
- I'll be back! - Let's go!

385
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,230
Lan Zhan. It's fine now.

386
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,080
That monster seems to have been somehow

387
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,150
sealed in the bottom.

388
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,630
You wait here.

389
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,600
Do you have a rope or something?

390
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,670
Nice browband you have.

391
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,120
You... You!

392
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,150
Me what?

393
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,760
At such critical time, don't care too much.

394
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,240
Can it be more important than your leg?

395
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,280
Hold it.

396
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,800
Hold it.

397
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
I almost forget this after all that mess.

398
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,520
Only a little left?

399
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,080
This is the panacea Wen Ning gave me.

400
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,120
How can it be?

401
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,840
I deliberately spared it for...

402
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,800
Never mind.

403
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,160
Better than none.

404
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,360
Here. Lan Zhan.

405
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,440
I have to find a way to force the stale blood out.

406
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Come. Take off.

407
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,400
Take off what?

408
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,560
What else?

409
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,680
Take off your clothes!

410
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,040
Drenched in that pond,

411
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,000
don't you feel uncomfortable

412
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
with your clothes wet?

413
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,920
Take them off. I'll dry them for you.

414
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,680
Take them off!

415
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,000
You don't, huh?

416
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,840
I help you.

417
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,920
Wei Ying! What are you doing!

418
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,280
Do what?

419
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Taking off clothes.

420
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,800
You don't take them off?

421
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,120
OK.

422
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,320
I take off mine.

423
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,240
OK there.

424
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,280
It's much better with the stale blood spitted.

425
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,040
Don't you feel much better now?

426
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,560
Thanks.

427
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,480
Don't say it.

428
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,440
I am afraid of others' thanks

429
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,920
especially your kind of formal thanks.

430
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,600
Gives me bumps.

431
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,280
Just a while.

432
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,840
What is it? Pain?

433
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,360
Just a while, OK?

434
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,240
It hurts, Lan Zhan.

435
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,400
You are welcome.

436
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,240
Lan Zhan.

437
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,240
You can make fun of me now.

438
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,640
Actually I used to get much injury too.

439
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,200
Every I got injured,

440
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,440
I'd go to swim as usual.

441
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,840
Besides,

442
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,240
The grass for blood condensation is not much left.

443
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,160
I think your wound need it much.

444
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,960
Since you're aware of pain,

445
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,560
don't rash it next time.

446
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
You think I'd like it?

447
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I had no choice.

448
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,440
Who knew Wang Lingjiao is such a venomous woman?

449
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,640
That girl Mianmian

450
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,520
is fairly pretty.

451
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,560
What if she got

452
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,360
some mark left on her face

453
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,200
for the rest of her life

454
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,560
by the hot iron?

455
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
The mark on your body

456
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,120
can't be gotten rid of for your life.

457
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,560
That's different.

458
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,240
It's not on my face anyway.

459
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,920
I'm a man.

460
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,600
A man should get wounded sometimes

461
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,800
and get some scars.

462
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,680
What's more,

463
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,280
even if the mark will be with me forever,

464
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,640
it represents that

465
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
I once protected a girl

466
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
who will never forget

467
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,160
me her entire life.

468
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
Just give it a thought.

469
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
It's quiet beautiful,

470
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,320
right?

471
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,680
So you know

472
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,280
she'll remember you forever?

473
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,160
Why are you mad?

474
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,120
If you don't mean it,

475
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,040
then you don't flirt with someone.

476
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,080
I didn't flirt with you anyway.

477
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,720
I see...

478
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,240
You see what?

479
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
I see that

480
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,600
you likes Mianmian.

481
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,760
You are fond of her?

482
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,920
Why should I talk these

483
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,320
meaningless things with you here?

484
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,360
You got no choice.

485
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,160
In this crap place

486
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,880
sit only you and me two unlucky guys.

487
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,960
You don't talk with me.

488
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,240
With who then?

489
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,920
Talking about that,

490
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,400
Lan Zhan,

491
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,440
you just talked to me for the longest.

492
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,080
After all that we've been through,

493
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,360
you're unwilling to talk.

494
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,400
Are all your Lan clan...

495
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,200
Lan Zhan.

496
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,760
Are you hungry?

497
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,480
You ever been through Inedia?

498
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,000
Stop eating and drinking like us.

499
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,880
It can last longer than 3 or 4 days.

500
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,240
If there is still none to come,

501
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,320
I suppose

502
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,160
our stamina, energy and spiritual power

503
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,400
will all go down then.

504
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,320
The distance between Gusu and Mount Muxi

505
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,640
is shorter than that between Yunmeng and Mount Muxi.

506
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,640
So it's probably your clan arrive first.

507
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,200
Let's be patient.

508
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,840
And don't worry,

509
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,760
even if your clan won't come,

510
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,240
one day or two,

511
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,880
Jiang Cheng should get to the Yunmeng.

512
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,080
Jiang Cheng is smart.

513
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,680
The Wens can't stop him.

514
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,360
We won't be able.

515
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,800
Cloud Recesses

516
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
has been burned.

517
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,040
Are your people safe?

518
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Your uncle.

519
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,560
Your brother.

520
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,120
Uncle is badly wounded.

521
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,320
Brother... is missing.

522
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,480
What?

523
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,240
Zewu Jun is missing?

524
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,640
Are you cold?

525
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,560
I've dried your clothes.

526
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,520
I can cover you with it.

527
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,280
You get some sleep

528
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,600
and tomorrow we...

529
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,760
Finally asleep.

530
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,040
It must be 9 p.m. now.

531
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,640
So the unbearable daily schedule of Lan clan

532
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,160
can be of use here.

533
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,280
We're trapped here

534
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,400
having incensed Wen Chao.

535
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,320
I wonder how is Jiang Cheng

536
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,480
and how is Yunmeng.
