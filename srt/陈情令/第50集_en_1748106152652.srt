1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the inception.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Part of the story

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 4

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 6

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Xie Zhen, Look behind.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,560
Time took two erotic actions.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,300
You...

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
What's wrong?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,400
I just opened three...

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,200
No, I just opened the back of Princess Jinzong.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,480
I don't know if she wants...

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
Is she...

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
An Xizhi?

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
An Xizhi?

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,880
Princess Jinzong, if you have any move, I won't let you hear it!

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Yes!

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
An Xizhi...

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Can I...

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
What are you looking at?

36
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Stop it!

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What can you see?

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
I haven't seen anything in so many years.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're still alive?

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're really good!

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm actually holding you like this!

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't move!

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't move!

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't move!

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've been holding you for a whole year.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No wonder...

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You've been hiding for so many years.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry for you.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Xizhi, believe me.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I saw her holding the back of Princess Jinzong.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Xizhi, don't move!

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No!

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No!

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
An Xizhi! An Xizhi!

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I've been lying and killing people for the rest of my life.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Like you, I've never done anything bad in the world!

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But I've never thought about killing my mother.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You...

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Back then, the Cloud Recesses were not known.

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You were the one who saved me from the fire.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Who was it?

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Later, Gu Sulan was the one who re-established the Cloud Recesses.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Who was it?

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So many years have passed.

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When I and the Great Yagong Gu Sulan were together,

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
they were always together.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But...

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Other than the spirit of the Yajin,

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry for the child.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I only care about you.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mingshan,

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I was so proud of him

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
because I knew his name.

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But you,

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Lan Xichen,

76
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you're so useless.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But you're as useless as Nian Mingjue!

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Second Brother,

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
now you won't even give me a scar.

80
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is him! Hurry up!

81
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's go!

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Second Brother,

83
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you're going to die with me?

84
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hurry up!

85
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Lan Zhan, take Zongjun away!

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hurry up!

87
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nian Mingjue,

88
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
do you think I'll be able to take you?

89
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Great Yagong Gu Sulan

90
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The Great Yagong Gu Sulan

91
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The Great Yagong Gu Sulan

92
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Xichen Dan,

93
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he was just like me.

94
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I thought I was very understanding,

95
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
but I found out that you didn't understand.

96
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I thought I was understanding again before tonight.

97
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But now I don't understand.

98
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Xichen,

100
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
who can understand a person?

101
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Huai Song,

102
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
did he really take me out on the back?

103
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I...

104
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I think I saw it.

105
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I saw it.

106
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Really?

107
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is Huai Song really?

108
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Xichen,

109
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
you asked me this,

110
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and I'm not even sure about it.

111
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know.

112
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Xichen!

113
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Lord Han!

114
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wei!

115
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Wei!

116
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you all right?

117
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you all right?

118
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you all right?

119
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you all right?

120
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Are you all right?

121
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What's wrong with your neck?

122
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Your neck is bleeding.

123
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Are you all right?

124
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Now, I'll go out.

125
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What should I do?

126
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's wrong?

127
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm...

145
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I watched too much.

146
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You watched too much.

147
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I was in such good mood.

148
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well.

149
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Just forget some.

150
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Jingyi, where's Wei Wuxian and her men?

151
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,680
They went out.

152
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,840
Out? Where did they go?

153
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
I just said they brought the little apple.

154
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Senior Wei just pulled the hand of the Han Guang Jun and Senior Wen

155
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,840
to go see the little apple.

156
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,720
Right. The little apple.

157
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
Help me take care of some fairy.

158
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Don't chase them.

159
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Jingxiao.

160
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They're gone.

161
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You just let them go?

162
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Otherwise,

163
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
you'd stay and eat.

164
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Say thank you.

165
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Say sorry.

166
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's because of you.

167
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's why they left.

168
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Jingxiao, you're so annoying.

169
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Is this your attitude to talk to your elder sister?

170
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll beat you up.

171
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's go back to Baginliang.

172
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Go back to your seat.

173
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Jingxiao.

174
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Did you say anything to Wei Wuxian?

175
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No.

176
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Come on.

177
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I saw it.

178
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You wanted to talk to Wei Wuxian and then you didn't tell me.

179
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't.

180
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll tell you everything.

181
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't know why they did that to you.

182
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I saw it clearly.

183
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,200
You wanted to talk to me without any reason.

184
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
But you didn't say anything.

185
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
It was just in the temple.

186
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's not that easy to say.

187
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I said it clearly.

188
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,000
Jiang Cheng,

189
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
the world is very bad.

190
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll go buy some medicine for the world.

191
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll take care of the world for you.

192
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You stay here.

193
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't leave, okay?

194
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Stop!

195
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Get lost!

196
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Boss, five swords.

197
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Stop!

198
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Go!

199
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Take care.

200
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll leave it to you.

201
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The master is here.

202
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The master is here.

203
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Take care.

204
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Go.

205
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Uncle.

206
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Uncle.

207
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Uncle.

208
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Uncle.

209
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Uncle.

210
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Uncle.

211
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Uncle.

212
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Uncle.

213
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Wei Ying.

214
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What's wrong?

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What's wrong?

216
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I...

217
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I didn't tell you anything.

218
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What's wrong?

219
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm late every time.

220
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Mr. Wang.

221
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Wei.

222
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Four-times chase?

223
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Why are you chasing me?

224
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're not afraid of your master's scolding.

225
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Wei.

226
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I have something important to ask you.

227
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What?

228
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I've been thinking about something.

229
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But I can't be sure.

230
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So I want to ask you,

231
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Mr. Han and Mr. Wei.

232
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What's the matter?

233
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm a good fighter.

234
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I've made something.

235
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I've got my eyes and stomach.

236
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I've been living in the desert.

237
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I've been thinking about the weather.

238
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The sun is rising.

239
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I can be a good fighter.

240
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I can have some friends.

241
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
They'll come to play with me.

242
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They'll ask Mr. Han to eat.

243
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And the last one to run away.

244
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Mr. Han is still a good fighter.

245
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Wei.

246
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Maybe I was too young at that time.

247
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I was not sure about many things.

248
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But I can be sure.

249
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I used to wake up.

250
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You wake up and ask.

251
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Didn't you wake up in the blue?

252
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Blue-dried bamboo.

253
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Blue moon.

254
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Blue moon.

255
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Blue moon.

256
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Wei.

257
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm a blue moon.

258
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Blue moon.

259
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Isn't it dead?

260
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He was in the desert the other day.

261
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Lan Zhan.

262
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Is it you?

263
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes.

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I've told you this all along.

265
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Wei.

266
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I miss you.

267
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I miss you.

268
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What are you crying for?

269
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I didn't cry.

270
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I just feel sad.

271
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I'm happy.

272
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know what to say.

273
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Then don't say it.

274
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes.

275
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then don't say it.

276
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Why is this kid so big?

277
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's really the child that Mr. Han called out.

278
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You called it out too.

279
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I just asked why the child is so handsome.

280
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I didn't ask you to call me.

281
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I did.

282
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's just that you're too small.

283
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think I did.

284
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I remember.

285
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Look.

286
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I did.

287
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
For example, how to change the beauty picture.

288
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I...

289
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And as a pretty girl.

290
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
A hundred words.

291
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
A hundred words.

292
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You're so beautiful.

293
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm not a beauty.

294
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm not a beauty.

295
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm not a beauty.

296
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You're so nonsense.

297
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
How can you be so close to this kind of thing?

298
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
How could I teach children these things?

299
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes.

300
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Uncle Wen can testify.

301
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Uncle Wen, what proof do you have?

302
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Don't say nonsense.

303
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm telling you, you little kid.

304
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Lan Zhan.

305
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
How can you teach him?

306
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He's very good at talking to me.

307
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Don't talk nonsense.

308
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Look at that pit.

309
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm telling you, you're so big.

310
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I can put you in there.

311
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Do you believe it?

312
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Why are you laughing at your little kid?

313
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yue.

314
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
How old are you?

315
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Do you remember?

316
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You used to hug Han Guang Jun's leg like this when you were little.

317
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Master.

318
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Release the ice.

319
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'll give you a different best friend.

320
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
chattering

321
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,500
My husband and I

322
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
We...

323
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,840
are going that way.

324
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
Where are we going?

325
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,660
Sir,

326
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,260
didn't you ask me before?

327
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,820
After the meeting,

328
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,700
what are you going to do?

329
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,060
I've discussed with Ah Yue.

330
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,660
I want to go back to Qishan

331
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,060
and look after the people.

332
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
I'll go with you.

333
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
No need.

334
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,620
You don't want me to go with you?

335
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
You've done enough.

336
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
What are you going to do next?

337
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Send Ah Yue back to the Cloud Recesses.

338
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Then what?

339
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
I'll go with you.

340
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
I can think about

341
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
what I want to do.

342
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,060
I'll go with you.

343
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Good.

344
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Qishan

345
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Anzhan, let's go.

346
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Where should we go?

347
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,060
Let's go, little apple.

348
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Let's go.

349
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Anzhan,

350
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
aren't you leaving?

351
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Qishan

352
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,060
Anzhan

353
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
Anzhan

354
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
Anzhan

355
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,060
Anzhan, to be honest,

356
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
I really didn't expect that

357
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
you'd go to the capital for this.

358
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,060
We've been here for a while.

359
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
I hope I can be free

360
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
and be free.

361
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,060
I hope I can be free

362
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
and be free.

363
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
I hope I can be free

364
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
and be free.

365
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,060
I'll be free

366
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
and be free.

367
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
Anzhan,

368
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
you're not Lord Han.

369
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

370
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

371
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

372
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

373
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

374
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

375
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

376
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

377
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

378
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

379
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

380
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

381
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

382
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

383
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
You're not Wei Ying either.

384
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I didn't expect that there are

385
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,060
more than 1000 rules in the Cloud Recesses.

386
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
Nie,

387
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,060
no matter how many rules are added to the Lan clan,

388
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
the most important thing is the family order.

389
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Do you know that?

390
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
I don't know.

391
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Please tell me.

392
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,060
That is...

393
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
you can't be so stubborn.

394
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,060
Wei Ying,

395
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,060
you're so arrogant.

396
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
I dare not.

397
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,060
I'm not good enough to defeat Xia Feng.

398
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
The Immortal Sect.

399
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Chief Nie.

400
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,060
I have a question.

401
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,060
I want to ask you a favor.

402
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Please tell me.

403
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Chief Nie has so much thought.

404
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Don't you want to be the Immortal Sect's disciple?

405
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,060
Wei Ying,

406
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
I remember someone said that

407
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
the beautiful scenery of the mountains and rivers,

408
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,060
no matter how long you look at it,

409
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,060
you won't feel tired.

410
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,060
I'm a person who's lost.

411
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,060
I won't be able to handle others.

412
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,060
But if I don't do what I should,

413
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,060
I won't be able to handle others.

414
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,060
Let's go.

415
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
You won't ask him anymore?

416
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
What?

417
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
Who let Mo Xuan Yu go?

418
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,060
Who let Dao Ling go?

419
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Who found Si Si and Bi Cao?

420
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,060
Who wrote that letter of treachery?

421
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,060
But these questions are not important anymore.

422
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Isn't it?

423
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,060
No.

424
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
I'll go that way.

425
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
I'll go this way.

426
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,060
You've decided where to go.

427
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,060
But the big brother of Heaven and Earth,

428
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,060
has left for a long time.

429
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,060
Is it Si Hai's home?

430
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,060
Nan Zhen, I'm leaving.

431
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
Little Apple,

432
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,060
I'm leaving.

433
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Little Apple,

434
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm leaving.

435
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,060
The mountains and rivers are not changing.

436
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,060
The green water is flowing.

437
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,060
The back of the river is flowing.

438
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
The river flows.

439
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
The river flows.

440
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
The river flows.

441
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
The river flows.

442
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
The river flows.

443
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
The river flows.

444
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
The river flows.

445
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,060
The river flows.

446
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
The river flows.

447
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,060
The river flows.

448
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
The river flows.

449
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
The river flows.

450
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,060
The river flows.

451
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,060
The river flows.

452
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
The river flows.

453
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,060
The river flows.

454
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Lan Zhan, next time we meet,

455
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I'll choose the name of this song.

456
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060
I've already decided.

457
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,060
The song is very long.

458
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,060
The clouds are far away.

459
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,060
The rain and the rain are all over.

460
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm so happy.

461
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,060
How can I wait for the dream to come true?

462
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:02,060
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

463
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,060
The snow is so cold.

464
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,060
The high rocks and hills have수가.

465
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,940
Fresh leaves mixed with wine.

466
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Bye,H investments are coming.

467
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,260
The登録 in my dream.

468
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,260
Those days are full of worries

469
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,040
For the new years.

470
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,580
The �as muy un наблюдado en mi suena de la tape gale.

471
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,060
Why don't we listen to

472
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,060
our memories with a momentary love?

473
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,480
The world has a fair and square future

474
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,800
Reggl Lee

475
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,800
The first time I saw a cat that was very cute.

476
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat that was very cute.

477
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,800
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat that was very cute.

478
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat that was very cute.

479
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,800
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat that was very cute.

480
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,800
By the way..

481
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
By the way..

482

By the way..

485
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
How is it different from the one the male?

486
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,800
They are in a different splashing pot.

487
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,800
They are in a different splash pit.

488
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,800
That is..

489
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
