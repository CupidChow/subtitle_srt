1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I got the key to the door.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,820
vaccine

17
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,540
You guys!

18
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,460
Since you've come to this place,

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,340
you should follow the God of Magic.

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,420
The first thing is...

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,500
Super Jeremy Tiang

22
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,780
Nice

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:40,780
The

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220
Why do we need to go to the church?

25
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,220
I don't want to go to church!

26
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,820
This time, we haven't heard about the church's accessories.

27
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,580
How could the Wen family be so cunning?

28
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,580
We don't want to go to church!

29
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,380
Who said that?

30
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,020
Which family should stand out?

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,940
It's because some of you don't understand the customs,

32
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,380
don't understand etiquette,

33
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,540
don't understand the world and the world,

34
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,220
or is that our ancestor's ancestral base only decided to teach you a lesson.

35
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,020
If we don't teach,

36
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,460
we'll have to fast forwards in these difficult times.

37
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,660
I have an idea.

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:38,880
Should someone also give us a chance to strive to the

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,480
top?!

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,140
What are you doing onboard?

41
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,240
You come here jokingly!

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Don't worry.

43
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Although I hate this Wen Chao,

44
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,540
I won't give up on this time.

45
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
I'll teach you.

46
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
Lan Zhan.

47
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
I'll teach you.

48
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,540
We are from the Jin family.

49
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,540
If you want to take it, take all of us away.

50
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,540
You dare to challenge the power of the Immortal Sect?

51
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,540
Young Master Wen, we are here to listen to the message.

52
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Don't make a fool of yourself.

53
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,540
Look, what I said is true.

54
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
You have long been trying to be a good person.

55
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
You think it's right?

56
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,540
Second Young Master Lan.

57
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,540
You have a plan to resist the Wen family.

58
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,540
It seems that not only you, but also you, Gu Su Lan.

59
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Come, bring him up.

60
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
Young Master.

61
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Young Master Wen, please forgive me.

62
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Lan Ling is in a bad situation.

63
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Our Young Master is not to blame for the Wen family.

64
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Please forgive him.

65
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Mian Mian, don't ask him to forgive.

66
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
We are from the Jin family.

67
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,540
We have no other choice.

68
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Young Master, you are a good boy.

69
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
What's your name?

70
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Young Master Wen, I've been in good terms with the Jin family.

71
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,540
When our leader was on his way,

72
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,540
he was very kind to me.

73
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
When I arrived at the Wen family,

74
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,540
I must have forgotten about the Li family.

75
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
Okay.

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I'll let you go today.

77
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
I'll let you go.

78
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Young Master.

79
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Come and see me.

80
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,540
Young Master, did you forget how I told you

81
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
when the leader was on his way?

82
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm just a simple person.

83
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,540
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

84
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Are you going to teach me or not?

85
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
I'll let you go today.

86
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
But listen to me.

87
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
If anyone dares to defy the Wen family,

88
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,540
please don't blame me for it.

89
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Everyone in your hands will be given a warm and crystal-clear note.

90
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,540
It's written in our history that

91
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,540
the glorious world and the wise words of the past

92
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,540
will be the most beautiful and beautiful.

93
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,540
I'll let you go today.

94
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
Young Master Wen,

95
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,540
I've been in good terms with the Li family.

96
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,540
I'll let you go today.

97
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Young Master Wen,

98
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,740
makeup,

99
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,540
etc.

100
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,640
If everyone in your hands

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,640
can be Jetzti's precious speaks into our world.

102
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,540
If anyone here wants to shrug and touch by it,

103
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,540
I'll have to consider to give Ling손 ackets.

104
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
As long as it's essasong,

105
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
Of course I will.

106
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
I will have to see it carefully.

107
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,540
How disgusting this shit is.

108
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Sister, you are back.

109
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Ning, are you okay these days?

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
I am fine.

111
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,540
I am just a little bit bored.

112
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
You are back.

113
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
By the way, sister,

114
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I heard that Uncle Wen

115
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,540
has come to the world to pray and worship.

116
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Do you think that

117
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,540
will Master Wei come back?

118
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,540
I am the last time to remind you.

119
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,540
If you ever come here again,

120
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,540
you will be the Wen Ning.

121
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Ning, remember,

122
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
Wei Wuxian and I are not one person.

123
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
We cannot be friends.

124
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Even if they come to Qishan,

125
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
you should not be a friend.

126
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
You are not a friend.

127
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
You are a friend.

128
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Even if they come to Qishan,

129
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
you should not be a friend.

130
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Why?

131
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
You don't have to know.

132
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Anyway, don't be a friend to Wei Wuxian.

133
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
But, sister,

134
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,540
Master Wei is a good person.

135
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
He saved my life.

136
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Ning.

137
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Sister.

138
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
You don't listen to what sister said?

139
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,540
Master Yan.

140
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't be shocked.

141
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Mom.

142
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Maybe that's you.

143
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,540
You say something here.

144
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,540
What's that?

145
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Your Majesty.

146
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Every time someoneいく,

147
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
a Scale is fried.

148
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,700
If you want to kill, you have to cut off your hair

149
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,300
to make thousands of people curse and wake up the rest of the world.

150
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,460
If that's really the case,

151
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,300
then there are more people in Qishan than pigs.

152
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,460
It seems that the face of the Empress is the family heritage of the Wen family.

153
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,300
That's true.

154
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Hello, Jiang Cheng. What are you thinking about?

155
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
Nothing.

156
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
You said...

157
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Where is Wen Qing?

158
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,540
He should be in the night sky.

159
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540
I don't know if he can see it.

160
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,540
Wen is so stubborn.

161
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:06,540
No.

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Wen is so stubborn.

163
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Why would he only catch Lan Zhan alone to listen to the news?

164
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Something must have happened.

165
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
You...

166
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Second Young Master has ordered that during the news,

167
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
the disciples of the family should not go out randomly.

168
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
I'm just going to find someone.

169
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,540
You can't even give him a hand.

170
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,540
Is this to see if he's a person or a monk?

171
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,540
It seems that I have to find a chance tomorrow.

172
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,540
How are the people of the Wen family?

173
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,540
Is there anyone who wants to go to the front to see me off?

174
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,540
Since no one is willing to come,

175
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
I'll just sign it.

176
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
Lan Wangji.

177
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Wei Wuxian.

178
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Jin Zi Xuan.

179
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
I won't.

180
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,540
You're not Hao Cheng's...

181
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Lan Shi Shuang Bi.

182
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
Why would you not know that?

183
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,540
It seems that you really don't know what I'm doing.

184
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Fine.

185
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,540
Wei Wuxian.

186
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Jin Zi Xuan, you two go first.

187
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,540
I won't.

188
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,540
I'll go first.

189
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Wei Wuxian.

190
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
You have to go first.

191
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
If something goes wrong,

192
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
I'll punish you.

193
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Wei Wuxian.

194
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
Are you going to carry it or not?

195
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
I'll carry it.

196
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,540
Why are you so anxious?

197
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
I'll carry it for you now.

198
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,540
One, you can't kill yourself in the middle of the night.

199
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,540
Two, you can't fight yourself in private.

200
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Three, you can't cause trouble.

201
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,540
You can't be idle, you can't be too busy.

202
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,540
You can't be too small and fool others.

203
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
You can't be so reckless.

204
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,540
You're so naive.

205
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
You can't escape.

206
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
You can't leave early.

207
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
You can't be so reckless.

208
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
You can't be so selfish.

209
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Shut up.

210
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Wei Wuxian.

211
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,540
You dare to send Lan family back to Qishan?

212
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
You're so naive.

213
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Really?

214
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm so stupid.

215
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,540
I'll carry it for you.

217
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,540
Shut up.

218
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Are you kidding me?

219
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Come on.

220
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
Bring them three to the kitchen.

221
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
You're so stupid.

222
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
What?

223
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,540
What are you talking about?

224
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Lan Zhan.

225
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,500
Jeezhao Taoba is pretty doing the honor,

226
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,100
but it's pretty far.

227
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,940
It'll catch that mermaid Rancho!

228
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,580
How's it going?

229
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,260
Not bad?

230
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:27,940
XIN.

231
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,100
Anybody?

232
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm alsoissiming.

233
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,540
You said your Lan family has a tree of jade.

234
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
Why don't you have a tree of jade?

235
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm leaving first.

236
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Lan Zhan, I heard that Wen Xu and his men went to the Cloud Recesses.

237
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
They recognized the jade metal in our hands.

238
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
If they didn't make it out, would it be difficult for them?

239
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
It's the first time they've made it out, right?

240
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Lan Zhan!

241
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Lan Zhan!

242
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Lan Zhan!

243
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
Lan Zhan!

244
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Lan Zhan!

245
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Lan Zhan!

246
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Lan Zhan, speak up!

247
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
I knew you wouldn't work hard.

248
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Tell me what you want to talk about.

249
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Okay.

250
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,540
I was just telling Lan Zhan that your dishes were familiar.

251
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,540
I was thinking about where the familiar smell came from.

252
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
It's been a long time.

253
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
I just remembered.

254
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
What do you mean?

255
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,540
Isn't it the smell you have?

256
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
How dare you!

257
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Young Master Wen, there are no more than three here.

258
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Wen Chao, I'm the one who scolded you.

259
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
Someone come out of my way.

260
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
You're not afraid of being shot.

261
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Wen Chao, don't be too much.

262
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
I'm so scared.

263
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Put him down.

264
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,540
Wei Wuxian, let's talk.

265
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,540
You just want to ask about the cause of Lan Wangji's death, right?

266
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
He's been living in my Qishan for a long time.

267
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Do you have any questions?

268
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,540
You're right.

269
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,540
I've got three silver sticks in my hands.

270
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Lan Er.

271
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
The real thing is a miracle.

272
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
There's one more piece of silver in the world.

273
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,540
If it weren't for Xue Yang,

274
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
you would have been the one who hid it.

275
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Wei Wuxian,

276
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I don't know where the silver stick is.

277
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,540
But you don't know it.

278
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,540
Wen Chao, don't talk nonsense.

279
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,540
We Qishan people will never wrong anyone.

280
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
As for if you have any silver,

281
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
we'll have a lot of time to investigate.

282
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,540
Come on, take him to the dungeon.

283
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Well, you want to be with him, right?

284
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,540
The dungeon of our Wen family is huge.

285
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
Wen Chao,

286
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,540
I'm sorry to have made you wait so long.

287
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Mr. Wen,

290
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,540
I can't bear to wait for you in the dungeon.

291
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,540
I'll see when you can get used to it.

292
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Take him away.

293
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Ning.

294
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Sister.

295
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,540
What are you doing here?

296
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
I...

297
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
I...

298
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,540
I told you not to mind your business.

299
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Let's go.

300
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Yes.

301
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Yes.

302
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
You prepared a room for me.

303
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,540
I have my own special place in this room.

304
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
You'll know when you get in.

305
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,540
You're welcome, Mr. Wen.

306
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm scared.

307
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,540
Our Young Master Wei is scared.

308
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Wei Wuxian,

309
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
tell me.

310
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
If you were to be with him,

311
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
can you still see the sun tomorrow?

312
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
Wei Wuxian.

313
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Wei Wuxian.

314
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Wei Wuxian.

315
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Wei Wuxian.

316
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
If you can live to the fullest,

317
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
I'll let you go.

318
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
If you die,

319
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,540
you'll have to blame yourself for being a smart mouth.

320
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Stay here.

321
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Enjoy your long night with him.

322
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
Wen Chao.

323
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Open the door.

324
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Go back.

325
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Go back.

326
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Where did you take Wei Wuxian?

327
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

328
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Don't bother me with that.

329
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
Stop.

330
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
You can leave.

331
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Wei Wuxian.

332
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Where's Wei Wuxian?

333
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
He hasn't come back yet.

334
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Didn't he take Wen Chao away?

335
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Miss Wen.

336
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
Miss Wen, you...

337
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Wen Ruohan,

338
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
did you have to make things difficult for you?

339
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
I'll try my best.

340
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
No.

341
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
No.

342
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
Wenjing.

344
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
Mr. Wei.

345
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Mr. Wei.

346
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Wenjing.

347
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
Mr. Wei, your wound...

348
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
Oh, right.

349
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
I brought you medicine.

350
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
This is a supplement.

351
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
It can help you with your pain relief.

352
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
And this.

353
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
This is a blood sample.

354
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
It's not necessary.

355
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,540
Let's not talk about this.

356
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
How are you and your sister?

357
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
I'm fine.

358
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Don't worry.

359
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
But

360
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,540
after Wen Chao brought her back,

361
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,540
Wen Shu Shu did get a heart attack.

362
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Because I'm a man.

363
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
I don't know

364
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
what Wen Shu Shu told her.

365
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Anyway,

366
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
after she came back from the fire station,

367
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,540
she was so strange.

368
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
She told me...

369
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
told me,

370
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
don't leave me and Lan Zhan.

371
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Why?

372
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
What are you looking at?

373
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
I'm looking for you.

374
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
I'm looking for you.

375
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
I'm looking for you.

376
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
I'm looking for you.

377
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm looking for you.

378
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
I'm looking for you.

379
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
I'm looking for you.

380
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
I'm looking for you.

381
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
I'm looking for you.

382
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
I'm looking for you.

383
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
I'm looking for you.

384
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
I'm looking for you.

385
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
I'm looking for you.

386
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
I'm looking for you.

387
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
I'm looking for you.

388
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
Wen Shu Shu.

389
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Thank you.

390
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Mr. Wei,

391
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,540
you don't have to thank me.

392
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,540
They did that.

393
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
I feel

394
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
sorry for you.

395
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Especially,

396
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
especially,

397
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
I don't know

398
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
what happened

399
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
to that man.

400
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I don't know.

401
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
What's wrong?

402
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
You don't know?

403
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Wen Shu Shu

404
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
from the fire station,

405
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
she was

406
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
with Lan Zhan to clean the house.

407
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
I heard

408
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
that

409
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
she was on fire

410
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
and burned half of her life.

411
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
The hundred years of time

412
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
was ruined.

413
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
Lan Zhan was hurt

414
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
because

415
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
he couldn't lock the last piece of the iron.

416
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Mr. Lan Er's leg

417
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,540
was cut by Wen Shu Shu.

418
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
You bastard!

419
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
Mr. Wei, don't move.

420
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Be careful of the wound.

421
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
By the way, I can't stay for long.

422
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,540
My sister will find out.

423
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,540
You take this medicine.

424
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Wen Shu Shu,

425
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
please take care.

426
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
Take care.

427
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Thank you.

428
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
I still have

429
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
this medicine for Lan Zhan.

430
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
I

431
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,540
have

432
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
this medicine.

433
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,540
Wei Wuxian,

434
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
are you still alive?

435
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,540
How many more legs?

436
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
How did

437
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
that little baby

438
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
do yesterday?

439
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:46,540
I'm not going to eat the meat

440
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
on your mouth.

441
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
It seems that

442
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
you are too big

443
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
for me.

444
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
It's useless.

445
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Wen Cheng,

446
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
you are a good cook.

447
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
You are a good cook.

448
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
You are a hero.

449
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
How dare you

450
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
to take a single shot?

451
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
Don't worry.

452
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
You are lucky today.

453
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
We have more time.

454
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Go.

455
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Go.

456
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
Wei Wuxian.

457
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Morning.

458
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Morning.

459
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
Morning.

460
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
What happened?

461
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
What's wrong with them?

462
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
You don't understand.

463
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
These are all my

464
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
glory.

465
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
My glory.

466
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
What?

467
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
I miss you

468
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
a lot.

469
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
I miss you a lot.

470
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
I miss you a lot.

471
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
I see you are not

472
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
enough.

473
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,540
No.

474
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
I will go to that place

475
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
and that's enough.

476
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
Nie,

477
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,540
do you have anything to eat?

478
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,540
What is the expensive flower cake?

479
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
What is the rose-flavored sweet potato?

480
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
I have been locked up

481
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
in that place for a day.

482
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
I haven't eaten anything for a day.

483
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm starving.

484
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
You are still a good cook.

485
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
You thought you were still

486
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
in the Lan Shrine?

487
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
No.

488
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
There is no expensive flower cake.

489
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
I'm full.

490
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
You can eat it.

491
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
It's delicious.

492
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Mr. Wen Er is here.

493
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
Miss Wen.

494
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Before we start the training,

495
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,540
I want to announce a few things.

496
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,540
I think you have heard about this.

497
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
The place of the Cloud Recesses

498
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
has been returned to Qishan.

499
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
The second thing is that

500
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Qinghe is a devout.

501
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Because of my Wen Shizhi's teaching,

502
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
I have no manners.

503
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
I am a great Buddhist.

504
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,540
I am a great Buddhist.

505
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,540
The Immortal Sect has ordered me to do so.

506
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,540
What about my brother?

507
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,540
He is a devout.

508
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
He is a devout.

509
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Then,

510
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
the Lan Ling Jin Shrine...

511
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,540
Wen Chao, how dare you!

512
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Mr. Jin,

513
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,540
I haven't finished my words.

514
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,540
The Lan Ling Jin Shrine is a big topic.

515
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
If you don't find trouble,

516
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
I will protect your parents.

517
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
All right.

518
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Now, the five great masters

519
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
are left with only the Jiang family.

520
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,540
It's a pity that Jiang Feng Mian is afraid of the world.

521
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,540
He is afraid to hide in his dream.

522
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Wen Chao!

523
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,540
Wen Chao!

524
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,540
You are the best!

525
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I am going to the Lan Ling Jin Shrine

526
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
to see it myself.

527
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Sister, you are back.

528
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
Sit down.

529
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Sister,

530
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
when you were teaching the temple,

531
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
did you see Mr. Wei?

532
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,540
Are they all right?

533
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Ning,

534
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
why did you mention them again?

535
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
You are all the same as Er Pang Feng, right?

536
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
I am not.

537
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I am not.

538
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,540
You are all the same as Er Pang Feng, right?

539
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Let me ask you,

540
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,540
where did I put the supplementary list?

541
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,540
You didn't go to the room last night.

542
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,540
Where did you go again?

543
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
I didn't know what you were doing, right?

544
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
If you still don't listen to me,

545
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
you don't need to go out.

546
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Just stay in the room.

547
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
Sister,

548
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
you have been teaching me

549
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,540
that the family of our Wen family is blessed.

550
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Mr. Wei,

551
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
he is my benefactor.

552
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
Ning,

553
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
you are the only one left

554
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
in my family.

555
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Do you understand?

556
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
Yes.

557
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,540
Wenmen,

558
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
listen to the road.

559
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,540
The mountain is full of mountains and rocks.

560
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Wenmeng,

561
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
love is like a child,

562
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,540
the mountain is full of people.

563
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,540
The family of the Weng family is blessed.

564
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,540
The land of the Weng family is blessed.

565
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
We should burn it together.

566
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
Stand still.

567
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
The land of the Weng family is blessed.

568
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,540
The land of the Weng family is blessed.

569
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,540
The land of the Weng family is blessed.

570
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,540
The land of the Weng family is blessed.

571
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Fai,

572
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
take him away.

573
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
The land of the Weng family is blessed.

574
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Sir.

575
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Mu Xishan?

576
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
What's going on?

577
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
We heard that

578
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,540
Mu Xishan is a very common place.

579
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
It's a very common place.

580
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
This place is a very common place.

581
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Ordinary people can't enter it.

582
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Even the people who are in the monastery

583
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
can't leave it.

584
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
So,

585
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
we have to break the curse.

586
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
However,

587
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
we sent the people of Zhenya

588
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
to kill them.

589
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
It's almost impossible.

590
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
So,

591
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
we came to report to you.

592
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Yes.

593
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
It seems that

594
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,540
I have to go to the police station personally.

595
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Sir,

596
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
the shoes are tight.

597
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Should we report to the magistrate first?

598
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
What are you afraid of?

599
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
There are so many people

600
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,540
who are on the line to kill me.

601
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
I'm afraid that

602
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
they can't leave me.

603
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
Sir, you are right.

604
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
What are you doing?

605
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Who are you?

606
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Who are you?

607
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
What a common face!

608
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,540
I think we are here to kill him.

609
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
We even

610
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
told him about the accessories.

611
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
What kind of monster

612
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
do we have to deal with?

613
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,540
What kind of treasure do we have?

614
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Don't talk.

615
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
Don't talk to them.

616
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
I don't know what to do.

617
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
But that virtue

618
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,540
is really embarrassing.

619
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
You have never heard of a saying.

620
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
A king and a dog

621
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
are heaven and earth.

622
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
That's the kind of scenery.

623
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Where did you hear

624
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
these messy words?

625
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
It doesn't matter

626
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
where you heard them.

627
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Just say it.

628
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
What are you thinking about?

629
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
You still want to help him?

630
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
You don't know what to do.

631
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
I told you

632
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
about the ban on the Lan family.

633
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
Look at his leg.

634
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
It's been a few days since he came back.

635
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
He must be hungry.

636
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
If I didn't help him,

637
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
his leg would be gone.

638
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,540
Enough, Wei Wuxian.

639
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,540
You helped him a lot.

640
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Go and carry him.

641
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,540
I'm afraid he doesn't want

642
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
you to come any closer.

643
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
How could he think of his own business?

644
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,540
What I do is my business.

645
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
Besides,

646
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
I caught him and carried him to my back.

647
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
He can kill me.

648
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,540
We can't even care about ourselves.

649
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,540
How can we care about others' business?

650
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
First, it's not a idle business.

651
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
Second,

652
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
we have to

653
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,540
take care of these things.

654
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,540
Lan Zhan,

655
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
are you okay with your leg?

656
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
No.

657
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Lan Zhan,

658
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
we're just

659
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,540
strangers.

660
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,540
What can't we say?

661
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
Your leg is really okay.

662
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
It's nothing.

663
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
Don't force yourself.

664
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
Or else,

665
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
I'll carry you.

666
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,540
I'm sorry.

669
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,540
I'm sorry.
