1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Both of you should sign the politeness agreement.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know what?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are not leaving when it's all waiting for you.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, it comes forward.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Forward.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Forward.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Forward.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Forward.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Forward.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Does the Eunuch think so?

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's probably...

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's okay.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You still have to go back to find Han Guangjun after you finish.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Jin Ling, you are a spy.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Me? You want to...

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You want me to supervise you?

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you don't want to, I'll do it.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Jin Ling, the Silver Bell of the Jiang family has been brought.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Silver Bell of the Jiang family has the effect of a clear god.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's use this to make a secret.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let me do it.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I won't do it again.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll do it again.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll do it again.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Stop talking.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's start.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Silver Bell of the Jiang family has been brought.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll do it again.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll do it again.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll do it again.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll do it again.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll do it again.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll do it again.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll do it again.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll do it again.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll do it again.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll do it again.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll do it again.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll do it again.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll do it again.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll do it again.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why is there a little girl?

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Can't you see?

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Miss.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Miss.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's a tree in front.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Be careful.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Miss.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Be careful.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Miss.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Be careful.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Miss.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Miss.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Miss.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Be careful.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you hungry?

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Take this for you.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you so shy?

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I...

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Take it.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you, sister.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you, sister.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're so pitiful.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't see it if I'm so small.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm scared.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm so young.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't see it.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're welcome.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Take it.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thank you.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sorry.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're not wearing glasses?

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I...

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't see it.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You...

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can't see it?

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Be careful.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Miss.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let me walk you.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Be careful, Miss.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll walk by myself.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Be careful, Miss.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're so mean.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're so mean.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're so cute.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're so rich.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You can't even afford to buy a house.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Miss.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Be careful.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Girl?

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't do that.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Since you said

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Song responsibility has tasted,

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
what happened?!

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why is her sister looking so sad?

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You don't like her?

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Miss, you can't see it, either?

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then slow down. Don't walk so fast.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not good to see people again.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This way.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The person is less.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you, brother. I'll go back myself.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Since you called me brother,

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
then return my money back.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll go back.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You bastard, return my money back.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Return it back.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This...

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't be so careless.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is against a little girl.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not good.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're a scumbag.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can't do anything.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You know she's a thief.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You stole my money.

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You protect her.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You...

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're her too, aren't you?

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Give me back my money.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're too bold.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You dare to steal things.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She just touched me.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I said, what's wrong with the money?

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She's so rich.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She's so rich.

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She's just pretending to be rich.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm afraid that the murderer's father will beat her up.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're so cheap.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Since that's the case,

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you shouldn't be so agitated.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If no one is here today,

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
then Yi'er will be in trouble.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Miss,

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you can do it yourself.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Where's your money?

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's here.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've given it to you.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There's not much money.

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't steal it before you finish it.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I heard that scumbag scolds you.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You can't see it.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll follow you in the future.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What do you want to do with me?

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What do you want to do with me?

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're a big blind.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm a small blind.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's go together.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There's a sign.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm a father and a mother.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm not going with anyone.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not going anywhere.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Besides,

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
if you don't promise me,

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll be gone soon

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
if you give me the money.

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can only steal and cheat.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll be beaten up

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
by a big-headed scumbag.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't find the way to the northeast or northwest.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're so cunning.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can't find the way to the northeast or northwest

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
if you cheat people.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Then you promised to take me, right?

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Brother Baiyi.

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't jump.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Be careful.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What's wrong?

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Nothing.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I... I'm a little bit out of breath.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's go to the city ahead

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and take a break.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're a little bit out of breath.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Do you want me to carry you?

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wait.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm out of breath.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What's wrong?

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Someone's lying here.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Is he dead?

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Should we bury the body

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
in the box?

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Not yet.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm just being hurt.

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A-ching.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's something useful nearby.

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There's a basin.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Find a way to the northeast.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll be there.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's go.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's go.

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's go.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's go.

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's go.

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's a basin.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Find a stove and boil some water.

246
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Be careful.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A-ching, hurry up.

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Coming.

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Water's here.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't move.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't move.

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
My wound is going to heal.

253
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't worry.

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll save you.

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I won't harm you.

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Who are you?

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You have eyes.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can't see it yourself.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There's a way to the east.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They're working hard to get you back.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They're giving you cure and life.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They're giving you the cure.

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're so mean.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A blind man.

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What?

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You can't see a blind man?

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're not a blind man?

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Or you'll be in trouble.

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You wouldn't know how grateful you are

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
if you woke up.

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're still making fun of me.

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't lean on that.

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Your leg hurts.

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's bleeding.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you keep pushing,

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
your leg might go bad.

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thank you.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What's wrong?

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Did I hurt you?

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I got hurt by myself.

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you so hurt?

284
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why did you ask me?

285
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why did you hurt me?

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Since you don't tell me,

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
why did I ask?

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I just met you.

289
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I just got a help.

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not a difficult thing for me.

291
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But after you got hurt,

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you're all gone.

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's my fault.

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm the one who hurt you.

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm the one who hurt you.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If it's my fault,

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't want to

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
have any other problem.

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But you'd better not move.

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Otherwise, the bone will be in danger.

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you for saving me.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey, Xia.

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Have some sugar.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't want to.

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't want to.

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You really don't want to?

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If you don't want to,

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you dare not come?

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll come.

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you throwing at me?

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Sugar.

314
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Please eat it.

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I forgot that you can't see me.

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I can't hold it.

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to hit you.

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Give me a hand.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is it good, Xia?

320
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have a name.

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't know my name.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm Xia Xiazi.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you don't tell me my name,

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll call you by your name.

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Listen.

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm Jing.

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You don't need Xia Xiazi to call me.

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're so weird.

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're so fat.

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're injured so badly.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're still carrying sugar.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you still have it?

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I love sugar when I was a kid.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't eat it.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm so fat.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I keep thinking.

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If I get fat one day,

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll carry sugar that I can't eat.

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So you still have it?

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Of course.

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You come.

342
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll give it to you.

343
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll give it to you.

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Jing.

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What's your brother doing at midnight?

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He's hunting.

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What?

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He's hunting?

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Really?

350
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Anyway, these two words are similar.

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's just a kind of hunting.

352
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Don't want money.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He can't see.

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can he hunt?

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're here again.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What's the problem if he can't see?

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Even if he can't see,

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
he's so good.

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The arrow is loose.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Just one word.

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hurry.

362
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can't see again?

363
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
How do you know he's fast?

364
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I said it's fast.

365
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The arrow of the Taoist master must be fast.

366
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Besides,

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can't see.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Can't you hear?

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What do you mean?

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You can't see us, can you?

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Where did you go?

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I went to find wood and grass.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I went to the roof.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I went out at night.

375
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And you were going to get hurt again.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're going out at night?

377
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're going hunting again?

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm just helping.

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm helping.

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to the roof.

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No need to bother.

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Qian You, do you know how to do it?

383
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I didn't try.

385
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll do it.

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I've been thinking about it.

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If you can't do it,

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
your injury is not healed.

389
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Can you?

390
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's better to walk more.

391
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Besides, I didn't hurt my legs.

392
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm used to this kind of pain.

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I was hit by someone.

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll help you.

395
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Don't follow him.

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Listen, he's your colleague.

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
When I talked to him,

398
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
he said he was hunting.

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He saved me at once.

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Only you can restrain him.

401
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He's a good guy.

402
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He's not a good person.

403
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He's a good guy.

404
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You've eaten his fruit.

405
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't drive him away.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He'll leave if he's hurt.

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
No one will stay with us.

408
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
How about I go out tomorrow night?

409
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No.

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You haven't recovered.

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Besides,

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I want to laugh when you talk.

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't hold it when I laugh.

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If I don't talk,

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll give you a sword and a hand.

416
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Don't mind me.

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay.

418
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Come on.

419
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Be careful.

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There's no one in this village.

421
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's all Kui Lei.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Good.

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Fortunately, you can lead Kui Lei.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Otherwise,

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
it's hard to kill two of us.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Check it out in the village.

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If there's no one alive,

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
burn these evil things as soon as possible.

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll go out tomorrow night.

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll go out tomorrow night.

431
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't worry.

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll go out tomorrow night.

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'll go out tomorrow night.

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Burn these evil things as soon as possible.

435
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Are these people really Kui Lei?

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Is this evil thing really helping the factory?

437
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What's going on?

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Go, go, go!

439
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Go, go, go!

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Xing Chen!

441
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Xing Chen!

442
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Miss.

443
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The day is coming.

444
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If you can't see it,

445
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
don't go to the office.

446
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Miss.

447
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What's the matter?

448
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Have you ever seen a blind man

449
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
who's been blinded by a hundred-and-one sword?

450
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What's the matter?

451
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I've never seen this man.

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Where is he?

453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's in the house.

454
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Where is he?

455
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I've seen him before.

456
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I've never seen him before.

457
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Miss.

458
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
How can I see him?

459
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Then...

460
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Answer me a few questions.

461
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Maybe you've seen him before.

462
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Okay.

463
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Are you a good friend of this Taoist?

464
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yes.

465
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Do you really know him?

466
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Then, how tall is he?

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He's a good friend of the beauty.

468
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What kind of sword is he?

469
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He's as tall as I am.

470
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He's as tall as I am.

471
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He's as tall as I am.

472
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay.

473
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't think you're a bad guy.

474
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Come with me.

475
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Miss.

476
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Miss.

477
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Miss.

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
What's the matter?

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Why didn't you come?

480
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Hurry up.

481
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Why didn't you leave?

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Why did he come back?

483
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Why is he here?

484
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Do you know who he is?

485
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
A bad guy.

486
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
If you don't tell me his name,

487
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
who knows who he is?

488
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Bai Yi saved him.

489
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
He's always with him.

490
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Disgusting.

491
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Xiao Jin Chen,

492
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm leaving.

493
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm not leaving.

494
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm leaving.

495
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm going.

496
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Come with me.

497
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Let's go.

498
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's go.

499
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay.

500
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Let's go.

501
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Old rules

502
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Pick one

503
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
This one

504
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Are you sure?

505
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You're short

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I won

507
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You go to buy food

508
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay, I'll go

509
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Come back

510
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll go

511
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Why are you going again?

512
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Are you stupid?

513
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Actually, I'm short

514
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But I've been hiding the longest one

515
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No matter which one you draw

516
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I can draw longer than you

517
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm just happy that you can't see

518
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, I won't talk

519
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll go buy food

520
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Wait for me to come back

521
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Brother, what's wrong?

522
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No

523
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
No

524
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Su Wen, no

525
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
No

526
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
How about we wake them up?

527
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's too dangerous

528
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Wait

529
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Wait again

530
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Hurry up, Yoling

531
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Hurry up, Yoling

532
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Senior Mo

533
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Senior Mo

534
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Wake up

535
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Senior Mo

536
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Senior Mo

537
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Senior Mo

538
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Senior Mo, wake up

539
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Xue Ya

540
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm so angry with her

541
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
She's so bitter

542
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
She's also very bitter

543
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
She's also very bitter because of Wan Yan

544
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Who did you give her?

545
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Xue Ya

546
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I got it

547
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Isn't that the gift?

548
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's a gift from Xi Ke

549
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Come and serve

550
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You are so stinky

551
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I came to the court to buy food

552
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But you came to kill me

553
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What the hell are you doing?

554
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I said why did you leave a hand?

555
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I was going to ask this

556
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Say it

557
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You scum

558
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Why do you want to do this to her?

559
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I didn't expect that you know me so well

560
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Say it

561
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Baby

562
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You are the one who is going to do this

563
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Do you know what your good friend Hao Zhijiao did?

564
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
He killed many bloodthirsty

565
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
He killed demons and killed demons

566
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
He didn't want to repay the debt

567
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He was so touching

568
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
He pinched your eyes

569
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and became a blind man

570
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But luckily Shuang Hua

571
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
would be willing to do it for him

572
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What's more

573
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I found that

574
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
as long as I cut off the snake head of those poisoned people

575
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Shuang Hua would be able to separate them

576
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
from the living

577
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and the evil

578
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So

579
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You are so ungrateful

580
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You are so ungrateful

581
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Mr. Song

582
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Sometimes I think

583
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you are so arrogant

584
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and you are so mean

585
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Because you are so cruel

586
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You don't have any intention

587
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and you don't have a way to kill people

588
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I don't need to be scolded

589
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
by these two words

590
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You

591
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You are so arrogant

592
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You are so cruel

593
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
He is blind?

594
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
He is blind because he gave his eyes to whom?

595
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It turns out that little uncle

596
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
gave his eyes to Mr. Song

597
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What position do you take me to?

598
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Friend?

599
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Are you ashamed to say

600
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
that you are Xiaoxing Chen's friend?

601
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I...

602
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Mr. Song

603
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Do you need me to remind you?

604
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
After I painted your white snow

605
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What did you say to Xiaoxing Chen?

606
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I...

607
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I...

608
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You were so sad

609
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and so sad

610
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and so sad

611
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and so angry

612
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So you are angry with him?

613
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
No

614
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
To be honest

615
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I painted your white snow

616
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
because of him

617
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And you are angry with him

618
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and so pitiful

619
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I am so sorry

620
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
for my bad behavior

621
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You said you don't need to see him again

622
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's you, Mr. Song

623
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
After he painted your white snow

624
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
you disappeared from the snow

625
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Why did you come here?

626
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You are not a grown-up, are you?

627
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Xiaoxing Chen

628
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You said you are not?

629
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
No

630
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Ha ha ha

631
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Is it you?

632
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I am here

633
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Why are you here?

634
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's meaningful

635
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I just came to see you

636
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Are you crying?

637
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes

638
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I just called him brother

639
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But he is not working anymore

640
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Are you crying?

641
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yes

642
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I just called him brother

643
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But he is not working anymore

644
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Let's go

645
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Let's go back to cook

646
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I am hungry

647
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I bought the food

648
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I bought it

649
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I met such a guy

650
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
who is so angry when I came back

651
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Mr. Wang

652
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Mr. Wang

653
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Mr. Wang

654
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Wake up

655
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Mr. Wang

656
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
What's wrong?

657
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Are you stupid?

658
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I told you

659
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's dangerous to be in a relationship

660
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's not your fault

661
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I am not a cook

662
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Be quiet

663
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I am so dizzy

664
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Mr. Wang

665
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
hard work

666
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I can see and talk to you

667
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Become like this

668
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You all have to bring good news

669
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You guys stay here.

670
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The puppet in the city won't come here.

671
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'll go and save her.

672
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Senior Mo, what did you see when we were together?

673
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We didn't talk much.

674
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We'll talk later.

675
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You can't talk so short.

676
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Don't talk too long.

677
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's better to say that Xue Yang must die.

678
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The puppet in the city

679
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Lan Zhan!

680
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Wen Ning, I'm coming.

681
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
These two nails are more delicate than the ones in Wen Ning's head.

682
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
The materials are different.

683
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's not hard to restore the essence of the Song Lan.

684
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Give it back!

685
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Xue Yang, what do you want her to give you?

686
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A pair of nails?

687
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
These two nails are not yours.

688
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why do you want her to give you back?

689
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Do you want to face her?

690
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Senior Wei, you're so shameless.

691
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I can't keep the love face.

692
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Don't you think I don't know what you've done these years?

693
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You were chased by the enemy.

694
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Xiao Xing Chen saved you.

695
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But you reported to her.

696
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You turned the living into a puppet and deceived Xiao Xing Chen.

697
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You even sent Song Lan to the city.

698
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You're a puppet.

699
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You're a puppet.

700
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You're a puppet.

701
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You're a puppet.

702
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You're a puppet.

703
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You're a puppet.

704
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You even turned Song Lan into a puppet.

705
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You even refused to let Xiao Jing go.

706
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You're so funny.

707
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You can still laugh.

708
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
She's so mean to you.

709
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You're pulling her back.

710
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You're playing this game with her.

711
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Who wants to play games with her?

712
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Then kneel down and beg me to repair her spirit stone.

713
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Why do you want to play games with her?

714
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Why don't you just laugh and play with her?

715
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You're so funny.

716
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You can still laugh.

717
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You're playing this game with her.

718
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You're playing this game with her.

719
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Who wants to play games with her?

720
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You can still laugh.

721
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You can still laugh.

722
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You can still laugh.

723
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You can still laugh.

724
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You can still laugh.

725
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You can still laugh.

726
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You can still laugh.

727
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You can still laugh.

728
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You can still laugh.

729
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You can still laugh.

730
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You can still laugh.
