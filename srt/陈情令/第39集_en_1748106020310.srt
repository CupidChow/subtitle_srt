1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fifth one is the first one.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fifth one is the first one.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fifth one is the first one.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the first one.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The fifth one is the first one.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Of course I can't keep my face.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you think I don't know what you did these years?

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You were chased by the enemy.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Xiao Xing Chen saved you.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But you reported it to the enemy.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You turned the living into a puppet.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You deceived Xiao Xing Chen.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You even turned Song Nan into this kind of woman.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You even turned Xiao Jing into a little girl.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You even turned Xiao Jing into a little girl.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't even dare to let go.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are laughing.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can still laugh.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She is so mean to you.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are pulling her back.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are playing this game with her.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who wants to play games with her?

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then why do you kneel down and beg me to repair her spirit stone?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What do you mean?

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She is going to be a high-class woman.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I won't let her do that.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you hate her so much,

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
then why do you want to kill Chang Ping?

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why?

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Didn't I tell you the reason?

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If I kill Yu Yang's family,

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I won't even leave a dog for her.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have a good reason.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But the time is not right.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are a man who is like a mute.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You are so evil.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you want to kill the whole family,

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
how can you spend years to complete it?

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who are you going to revenge for?

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You know it all by yourself.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Then tell me.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do I know?

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What do I know?

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You want to kill or kill?

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why do you want to use the spirit stone to represent the punishment?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why do you want to use the double-edged sword?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And you don't need your own weapon?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why do you want to dig out Chang Ping's double-edged sword?

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let him become a fool and be a fool.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are talking nonsense.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Fu Chou?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Do I still want him to die?

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Fu Fu!

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are talking nonsense.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Fu Chou?

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you want to kill him?

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You are indeed Fu Chou.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But who are you going to revenge for?

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You are kidding me.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you really want to revenge,

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the one who should be the most powerful is you.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This little dragon's life is too strong.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It seems that he doesn't feel the pain at all.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I have to tell him a few more words.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But I am really curious.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Even if you are wearing a piece of silver,

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you will still be able to kill him.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I will not kill him.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I am not going to kill him.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are going to kill him.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How can you kill him?

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are going to kill him.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You are going to kill him.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are going to kill him.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are going to kill him.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Even if you are wearing a piece of silver,

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am afraid that you will not be able to recover half of your soul.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I am afraid that you will not be able to recover half of your soul.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let me guess.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Someone must be helping you, right?

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let me guess.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You said that guy is good at acting.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You are going to make him a friend who is not as good as you.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are going to make him a friend who is not as good as you.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why doesn't he come to help you?

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why doesn't he come to help you?

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Say something.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Say something.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Say something.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Say something.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I am going to kill him.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You are going to kill him.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
As long as you are here, I will not kill him.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
At least, he won't get hurt because of you.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
For me, he is a good man.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I won't kill him.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will kill him.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't risk this.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can't risk this.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can't risk this.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't risk this.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You've been hiding for years.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now you're out.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you going to follow me?

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No!

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Lan Zhan, the Ghost-Fiends...

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The fire-dark talisman they made is still being taken away.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I just shot him three times,

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but I still let him get away in the fog.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
At least, we know that Xue Yang and Ghost-Fiends

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
are the same person.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sure that's why they're so good at fighting.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sure that's why they're so good at fighting.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sure that's why they're so good at fighting.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sure that's why they're so good at fighting.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
At least, we know that Xue Yang and Ghost-Fiends are the same person.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm afraid that they're the same master.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Lan Zhan, what are you thinking about?

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ghost-Fiends are very clever.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They're both from the Lan family,

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but they have the same style as Lan Lin.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They're here!

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Lord Han, you're finally back.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Senior Mo, this is...

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's okay. They're back to their original form.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Senior Mo, they...

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll tell you later.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Leave the rest to them to handle.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll tell you later.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is it fun?

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Fun?

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why not?

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Be careful, Lord Han.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You want to know how I broke my finger.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You don't want to tell me.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
After you've told me,

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you still think it's my fault.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then what do you want to do?

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you remember the story of that kid and Tang Guo?

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That kid really wanted to eat that Tang Guo.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He tried his best to catch the car,

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and he was in the car.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He wanted them to stop.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But that man was so annoyed by his crying.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He took the whip of the car's owner

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and put it on his head and pulled it down.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Then the car's owner

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
was so angry with you.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He was so angry that he broke his finger.

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He didn't take the whip of the car.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You also took the whip of the car.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When Xiao Xing Chen caught me,

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
he was so annoyed.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That man was Chang Ping's father.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Chang Zi An broke your finger.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Even if you want to revenge,

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you can just break his finger.

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There are so many ways.

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can break two or ten fingers.

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Or even break a arm.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But why did you kill the whole family?

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Did you break your finger

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to make up for the 50 people?

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Of course!

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Your finger is yours.

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You are a stranger.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can't even beat the most people.

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You are just over 50 people.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How can you beat me?

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What about the Tang people?

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why did you make the Snow White Pavilion?

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why did you make the eyes of the dead?

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Then why did you stop me?

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why did you love me?

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why did you break the head of the Chang family?

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Xiao Xing Chen,

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
from the beginning,

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you were wrong.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You shouldn't have done anything wrong.

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No matter who you are,

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you should have done everything right.

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Or you shouldn't have gone down the mountain.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You are so smart.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why didn't you listen to him

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and ask him for help?

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If you don't understand what's going on,

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
then don't do it!

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Xue Yang, you are so disgusting.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Xiao Xing Chen,

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
why do I hate you?

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The thing I hate the most

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
is that you are a righteous person.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You think you are a high-ranking person.

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You think you can do something good

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and the world will become a fool

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and you will be a fool!

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You are disgusting.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Very good.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Am I afraid of being disgusting?

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But,

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are you qualified to be disgusting?

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In these days,

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
will we be out for a few days

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to kill a bunch of evil spirits?

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What do you mean by saying that?

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Nothing.

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's a pity.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You are blind.

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Both the eyes and the beads

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
are all destroyed by yourself.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I can't see those people who were killed by you.

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
When they were all over your heart,

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
they were so scared and so bitter.

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And those tears of tears

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
were all on your knees

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
to let them go.

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If they didn't die for me,

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
they would be in great pain.

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They would scream and beg for mercy.

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are lying.

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You want to lie to me?

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes.

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I lied to you.

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I have always lied to you.

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I know that.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I lied to you, but you believed me.

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't lie to you.

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You didn't believe me.

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Shut up!

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Shut up!

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay.

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I will shut up.

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
If you don't believe me,

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
then you should be the one who is behind you.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let him tell you

278
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
whether I lied to you or not.

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Zichen.

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Zichen.

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Is that you?

282
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What's going on?

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Say something.

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Say something.

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Who said something?

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What's wrong?

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Two old friends meet.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They are about to cry.

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you want to hug them?

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You are so funny.

291
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You can't even save yourself.

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You are a fool.

293
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You are a fool.

294
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You are a traitor.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You have your own way.

296
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Forgive me.

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Didn't you have a gift just now?

298
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why are you making trouble again?

299
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Are the news reliable?

300
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Three good friends.

301
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What's on the same day that you were dead?

302
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm going to make a cake with the leftover cream.

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm going to make a cake with the leftover cream.

304
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm going to make a cake with the leftover cream.

305
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm going to make a cake with the leftover cream.

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm going to make a cake with the leftover cream.

307
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm going to make a cake of the leftover cream.

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm going to make a cake with the leftover cream.

333
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I need a Su Ling Nang.

336
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I...

337
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
There was a child

338
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,880
who liked to eat sweet things.

339
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
But because of my parents,

340
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
I couldn't eat it.

341
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I couldn't eat it all the time.

342
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
So he thought every day

343
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,360
that if someone could give him a pain every day,

344
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,360
it would be great.

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
A Jin's...

350
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
That Xu Yang is a scoundrel!

351
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
He died so cheaply.

352
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
If I were here now,

353
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
I would let him die.

354
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880

358
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Go back.

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Finally, you have a reaction.

361

Wait for us here.

362
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
We will go back.

363
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Okay.

364
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Song Xiong

367
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,880
This is the spirit of his existence.

368
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Song Xiong

369
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Miss A Jin has passed away.

370
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,880
We buried her outside the city.

371
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,880
I wonder what Song Xiong is going to do.

372
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Song Xiong

373
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Song Xiong

374
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Song Xiong

375
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Song Xiong

376
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Mingyue's little star,

377
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Song Zichen's little star,

378
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,880
I wonder if they are still together.

379
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Song Zichen

380
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Song Zichen

381
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Zhenyapa Zhenyapa

382
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Be careful.

383
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
It's a rare weapon.

384
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
It's a weapon.

385
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Xun Hao

386
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Xun Hao

387
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
This is the place where people should live.

388
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Zizhui, what do you think?

389
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Where is Zizhui?

390
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Zizhui

391
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Zizhui, what are you doing?

392
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
How old are you?

393
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
I'm three years old.

394
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
None of your business.

395
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
We can buy anything we want.

396
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
It's not the money you spend on Lanling.

397
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
I'll go and see.

398
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Zizhui, don't look.

399
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
We have all these in our company.

400
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Okay, I'll go.

401
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Jingyi, do you remember what you did three years ago?

402
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Who remembers this?

403
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,880
It's just playing around in the cloud.

404
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
What are you doing?

405
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Nothing. I'm just asking.

406
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Zizhui, look at this.

407
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Zizhui

408
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Zizhui

409
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Zizhui

410
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
A'Yu

411
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
Do you like it?

412
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
I do.

413
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Lan Zhan,

414
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
you still say you don't like rabbits?

415
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
I don't know.

416
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
I'm just asking.

417
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
I don't know.

418
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
I don't know.

419
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I don't know.

420
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
I don't know.

421
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I don't know.

422
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
I don't know.

423
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
I don't know.

424
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
I don't know.

425
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
I don't know.

426
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
I don't know.

427
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I don't know.

428
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
I don't know.

429
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Lan Zhan,

430
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
let's buy them down.

431
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Okay.

432
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Aircraft, aircraft.

433
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
What's up?

434
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Well, Zewu army is here.

435
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
They are waiting for you in the inn.

436
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Senior Mu, this is Donglong.

437
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Take it.

438
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Looks like we have something to do.

439
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Are you sure?

440
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Did you see my brother?

441
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,880
We saw the corpse in the castle in the seal.

442
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
It was well preserved.

443
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Even the clothes were not damaged.

444
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,880
The Taoism until the corpse was changed into the original form.

445
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Brother.

446
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
He is really the Chifeng.

447
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Brother, forget it.

448
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
No need to say.

449
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,880
The Chifeng

450
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Back then,

451
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
I saw my brother

452
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
walking in the forest and getting in the fire.

453
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
He was so shocked.

454
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Although he didn't have any blood in his veins,

455
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
I

456
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
have prepared for it.

457
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
Zewu army,

458
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
I have something to ask you.

459
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
Please.

460
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Han Guangjun said

461
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,880
we had a hand in the Ghost Face of the Chifeng

462
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
that was not in the original form.

463
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
But Han Guangjun didn't say anything.

464
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
This person is not only a good example

465
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
of your way of seeing the Chifeng,

466
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
but also a little bit of a golden trick.

467
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Do you know who this person is?

468
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
This Ghost Face

469
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,880
is not only a way to know the Chifeng,

470
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,880
but also a way to hide the identity of the Ghost Face.

471
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Not only in the Yueyang,

472
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
but also in the Yicheng,

473
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
to help the Xuyang brothers.

474
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
This person

475
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,880
obviously doesn't want us to see the corpse of the Chifeng.

476
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
He is also afraid that we will see

477
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
the Ghost Face of the Xuyang.

478
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
We can still ignore it for now.

479
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,880
This person doesn't want us to know the secret.

480
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
But it seems that

481
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
this person is a very well-known

482
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
and well-known person in the Ghost Face of the Chifeng.

483
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
A person who is very close to the Gu Su Lan

484
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
and is very close to the Gu Su Lan.

485
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
He is even a person

486
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
who is far away from the Chifeng.

487
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
He won't do that.

488
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Zewu Jun,

489
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
you have been investigating the Ghost Face

490
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
for a long time.

491
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Including the people who have been in the Ghost Face.

492
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
It happened this month.

493
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
And this month,

494
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
he has been with me for almost a whole night.

495
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
A few days ago,

496
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
we even planned together

497
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
to have a talk

498
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
at the Lanling Golden Stone

499
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
in the next month.

500
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
We planned it separately.

501
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
So that Ghost Face

502
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
can't be him.

503
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
What if we use the transmission?

504
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
If we want to use the transmission,

505
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
we need to practice the transmission first.

506
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
This technique is extremely difficult to repair.

507
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,880
It has no trace of any repair.

508
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
And if we want to use this technique,

509
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
we need to use a lot of spiritual power.

510
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Not long ago,

511
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
we just went out to hunt.

512
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
He was in a hurry.

513
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
So I decided

514
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
he never used the transmission.

515
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
He doesn't need to go there.

516
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Zewu Jun,

517
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
you know very well

518
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
who is the person who is most suspicious.

519
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
You just don't want to admit it.

520
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Yes, I know.

521
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
These years,

522
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
people have misunderstood him.

523
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
But I

524
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
have been believing

525
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
what I saw in person for so many years.

526
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
He is not like that.

527
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Actually, Zewu Jun has changed.

528
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
I can totally understand.

529
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
After all,

530
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
the impression in my heart

531
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
is not that bad.

532
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Didn't we discuss about Xue Yang before?

533
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Why did you come to Mr. Wei Wuxian?

534
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
What did Xue Yang do?

535
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
He is a person who is not good at playing the piano.

536
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Wei Ying and him

537
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
will only make people more disgusting.

538
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,200
They are just

539
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
a mess.

540
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,880
They should be all over the place.

541
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Why are you so angry?

542
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Didn't you say Wei Wuxian shouldn't be killed?

543
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
He just said

544
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
the one who is good at playing the piano

545
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
is not Xue Yang.

546
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Do you need to say something?

547
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Didn't he say something?

548
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
The one who is good at playing the piano

549
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
may not be the one who uses him to do things.

550
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Who is the one who is good at playing the piano?

551
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Tell me,

552
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
who else can be the one who is not good at playing the piano?

553
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
We had some fun.

554
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
But...

555
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
I wouldn't trust

556
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
you.

557
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
I don't trust Yan underscore.

558
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
No worries.

559
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,280
A femalebye!

560
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,080
I am sorry!

561
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
I just confirmed it.

562
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
So, you should know that

563
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
Dao Lin is in the Mo family.

564
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
It's not a coincidence.

565
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Please think about it.

566
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I just confirmed it.
