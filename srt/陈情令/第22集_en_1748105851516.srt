1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
нить

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,180
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,680
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

14
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,260
Yay!

15
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,800
This time, I犯 whereby the cat is always okay.

16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,200
I found the cat's face where I raised the cat.

17
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,240
So I took a picture with my movement.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,360
The damage was almostore.

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,360
An Zhan, do you think this place is familiar?

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,360
We were in the Cloud Recesses, and we both were in this kind of position.

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,360
It's a fight.

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Oh, right, right, right, right.

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,360
It's me, Ye Fan Xiaojian, who brought you two to catch the bag.

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,360
It's a pity that there's no Tian Zi Xiao now.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Try changing. How can it be the same as before?

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,360
An Zhan, thank you.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
What do you want?

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Thank you for not telling my sister.

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
This knife is a loss. It's a loss of confidence.

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,360
I know. But Lan Zhan, I really didn't repair the evil knife that Xue Chong caused.

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I repaired the Ghost Knife.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Ghost Knife?

33
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
This is what I got in the last three months.

34
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I got it in the days of the day without a day.

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,360
But, in the end, I still have to thank you guys for the Silver Tree.

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,360
My Ghost Knife is made of Silver Tree, and it's a curse.

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Using a bamboo flute to control everything.

38
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,360
The Ghost Knife is a new kind of knife.

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
It's like a fire that burns in the fire.

40
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,360
If it's burnt, it will burn to ashes.

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,360
The consequences are not good.

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I know.

43
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Lan Zhan, I understand your worries.

44
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,360
But I will never have a day that will be like the day of the evil knife.

45
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Do you believe me?

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I believe you.

47
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I will help you.

48
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I will help you.

49
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Okay.

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,360
At the end of the day, I will surely freezing to ashes.

51
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Who will stop Your Excellency?

52
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
REI?

53
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Naw우.

54
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Let me dead.

55
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,440
of my efforts

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
Of the day

57
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,600
I, Qinghe Nie Mingjue

58
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
lead the army as aizing

59
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,320
Attack on not bank

60
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,440
Take the tender determines

61
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,320
And

62
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,300
on charge

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,040
Gets killed

64
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,800
Gets killed

65
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,980
Gets killed

66
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,940
Gets killed

67
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,800
Gets killed

68
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:05,560
Sun早日

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,240
Go

70
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,040
Ring Same

71
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,200
хоть오리

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,120
꺼

73
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
I'll wait for you in Qishan.

74
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Uncle Dong told you to go to Qishan with me.

75
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Kill some people first.

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Why didn't you go with them to see the city?

77
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I'm not going to the city to see the city.

78
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
It's hot in Huagong.

79
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
You like to see the heat the most, right?

80
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Wei Xiu!

81
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
You must take care of yourself!

82
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I'll wait for you in the city.

83
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
I'll wait for you in the city.

84
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I'll wait for you in the city.

85
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
No!

86
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
I'll wait for you in the city.

87
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Go!

88
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Go!

89
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Don't move!

90
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Go!

91
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Master!

92
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Hurry up!

93
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
We're going to help the army!

94
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Hurry up!

95
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Hurry up!

96
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Go!

97
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
This method is really useful.

98
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Thank you, Master.

99
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Master!

100
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Master!

101
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Master!

102
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Master!

103
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Master!

104
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Master!

105
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Master!

106
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Master!

107
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
This time, the attack didn't go well.

108
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
The two of them were killed in a flash.

109
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
I was wrong.

110
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,120
It seems that the power of the iron is really not as good as the small area.

111
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
That's right.

112
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
If the enemy attacks on the mountain,

113
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,120
these ghosts will be like the dead body and it will be hard to kill.

114
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Even if they are broken and broken, they can be attacked.

115
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
If the iron power is really not so good,

116
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
how can we attack the night sky?

117
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
That's right.

118
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Even if we have a thousand soldiers,

119
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
we can't fight with the dead body.

120
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Since the front wall is not clear,

121
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
as far as I can see,

122
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Qin is the king of Qin.

123
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
What you mean is that

124
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
I entered the night sky alone and killed Wen Ruohan.

125
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
If he dies,

126
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
the ghosts in his hands will be controlled.

127
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
In the end...

128
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Master Nie,

129
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
killing Wen Ruohan is easy.

130
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
How can you risk your life?

131
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
But as the commander,

132
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,120
how can I send my soldiers to the bottom of the world?

133
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
If I die,

134
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,120
the Zewu Army will lead the whole army.

135
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Master Nie.

136
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Brother Mingjue.

137
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I have something to tell you.

138
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Please take a look.

139
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
This is...

140
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Qi Shan's unyielding map.

141
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
How did they do this?

142
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
They met the Wen clan's army.

143
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
If they were killed by the sword,

144
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
if they didn't,

145
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
they would be killed by the sword.

146
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
If they didn't,

147
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
they would be killed by the sword.

148
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
We would be the same.

149
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
It seems that Qi Shan's three formation

150
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
has expanded the power of the Yin Iron.

151
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
How is it, Lan Zhan?

152
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
It's not working.

153
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
It's been three months.

154
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
It's not working.

155
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Master Wei.

156
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
What's wrong?

157
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Go back and have a look.

158
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Miss Jiang.

159
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Miss Jiang.

160
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Senior sister.

161
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Senior sister.

162
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Anxin.

163
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Senior sister, what's wrong?

164
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Don't cry.

165
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Tell me.

166
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Did that bastard bully you again?

167
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Anxin.

168
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm fine.

169
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Let's go.

170
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Let's go.

171
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Let's go.

172
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Master Wei.

173
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
You're here.

174
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Tell me what happened.

175
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Master Wei, it's not what you think.

176
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
You said you knew.

177
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Tell me.

178
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
What can't you say?

179
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
It's like we did something

180
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
that we can't see in the world.

181
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
You...

182
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Master Wei.

183
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Anxin.

184
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
It's like this.

185
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Since Miss Jiang's departure,

186
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
she has been helping others

187
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
and helping others.

188
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Every day,

189
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
she will make more soups.

190
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Two bowls of soup

191
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
are for two brothers.

192
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
You and Master Jiang.

193
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
This third bowl...

194
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
is for my son.

195
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Nonsense.

196
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
It's A Yuan.

197
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
Master, it's not like that.

198
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
It's Miss Jiang's fault

199
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
that she personally gave it to you.

200
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
That's why she asked for A Yuan.

201
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
She was looking for me at first,

202
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
but I think it's not good.

203
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
So she gave it to A Yuan.

204
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,120
As long as she secretly put it in your account,

205
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
who knows...

206
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Master.

207
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Don't blame Miss Jiang.

208
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
But A Yuan clearly told me...

209
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Is it a full-faced and ugly

210
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
and unkind confession?

211
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Mianmian, keep it to yourself.

212
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
When Miss Jiang came to deliver the soup today,

213
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
she and our master had a fight.

214
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
I think...

215
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Master Jiang

216
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,120
thought that Miss Jiang was visiting A Yuan.

217
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
So he reminded Miss Jiang...

218
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
and Miss Jiang...

219
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Master Jiang, you really misunderstood.

220
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Miss Jiang,

221
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
since we have already made a engagement,

222
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
why do you have to do this?

223
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
You think I'm making a engagement?

224
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
I sent Miss Jiang to Qinghe

225
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
and it was a mission.

226
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Why do you have to come to the battlefield to suffer this?

227
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm not coming with you.

228
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I'm not...

229
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
I'm asking for A Yuan.

230
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
No, I'm not.

231
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm not...

232
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Miss Jiang, I'm going to see you.

233
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Don't think that you can just go out

234
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
and just do whatever you want.

235
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Some people are in danger

236
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
and are more than just a few.

237
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Please, take care.

238
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Take care.

239
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Jin Zixuan,

240
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
why do you make me lose my temper?

241
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Master Wei,

242
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
actually, my master didn't do anything.

243
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
It's a misunderstanding.

244
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Yes, Master Wei.

245
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
It's a misunderstanding.

246
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Yes, it's a misunderstanding.

247
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Please calm down.

248
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Misunderstanding?

249
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Master Wei.

250
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Master Wei.

251
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Master Wei.

252
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Wei Ying, calm down.

253
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Master Wei.

254
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Xichen,

255
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
this Qishan Prefecture is designed

256
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
to be a secret.

257
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Where did you come from?

258
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Although Qishan is a common thing,

259
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
it's not that far away.

260
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
The Prefecture is a few months away.

261
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
So even if there's a slight difference,

262
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm sure it's between the two.

263
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm sure it's a secret.

264
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm sure it's a secret.

265
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I'm sure it's between the two.

266
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
The disciple of the painting is a good person.

267
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
He's a good person.

268
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
But I've been observing the painting for several days.

269
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
I'm sure I lost it.

270
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare to give it to you.

271
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
You haven't told me

272
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
what you were thinking

273
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
when the cloud was burnt.

274
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Who did you find?

275
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
You really thought it through.

276
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
That's what you said.

277
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
The person who sent the painting

278
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
and the person who saved you

279
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
is really a good person.

280
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

281
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
It's just that the master is not here yet.

282
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
He's hiding his identity.

283
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
If I don't pass his time,

284
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I wouldn't dare to reveal his identity.

285
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
So please,

286
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
don't blame me.

287
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm a good person.

288
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
How could I blame you?

289
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
If that's the case,

290
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
I'll believe you.

291
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
But

292
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
the Qishan Forest is really a secret.

293
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
The Wen Zeyi

294
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
has three Yin Iron

295
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
and three Chu as the Zhen Yan.

296
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
It seems that

297
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm the only one who can survive.

298
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Even you

299
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
have a war in the future.

300
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
For everyone,

301
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
there's no way back.

302
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
That's right.

303
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
If that's the case,

304
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
we'll both be the ones to fight.

305
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
No matter how I kill that Wen Zeyi,

306
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
we'll be the ones to

307
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
kill Bu Ye Tian.

308
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Get out of the way.

309
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Get out of the way.

310
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
Get out of the way.

311
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Get out of the way.

312
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
Brother, Zewu Jun,

313
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Mr. Jiang, Mr. Wei.

314
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Wang Ji.

315
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
We've encountered

316
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
the warm-hearted Kuei Lei

317
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
in the journey back.

318
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Now,

319
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
we should be at the back.

320
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
We'll be catching up soon.

321
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
We'll be catching up soon.

322
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Now,

323
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
both the rear soldiers

324
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
are chasing the soldiers.

325
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
We can't let them

326
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
go.

327
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
That's why

328
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
we have to follow them.

329
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't think

330
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
they'll find us.

331
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
They all have their own way.

332
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Now,

333
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
there's only one way to go.

334
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Bu Ye Tian.

335
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
I'm afraid these three Kuei Lei

336
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
don't just want to kill us,

337
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
but also want to

338
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
make us

339
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
go into Bu Ye Tian.

340
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Wen Ruohan

341
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
deliberately led us there.

342
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Brother Mingjue

343
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
is heartless.

344
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Now, it's not the time for seven days.

345
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
We're going to

346
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
climb the mountain with a rash.

347
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm afraid it's

348
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
the great plan of the Clan Leader Nie.

349
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
We have a wolf and a fox now.

350
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I'm afraid we'll be in danger.

351
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Whether we go into Bu Ye Tian

352
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
is not our choice.

353
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
If that's the case,

354
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
we'll be here to fix the border.

355
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
We'll kill Bu Ye Tian.

356
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Zewu Jun,

357
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
who did the plan of the Qishan

358
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
and Bu Zhen?

359
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
It's a gift.

360
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Brother.

361
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Wang Ji.

362
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
You don't have to

363
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
tell me who he is.

364
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
He is a friend.

365
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Not a enemy.

366
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Even if he wins today,

367
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
we'll go into Bu Ye Tian.

368
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm sure he has his reason.

369
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Brother Mingjue.

370
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
You said my body

371
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
is a demon.

372
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
I'm going to show you

373
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
the justice today.

374
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
How powerful

375
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
the power of our demon

376
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
is!

377
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
You're so strong!

378

You're so strong!

385
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
You're so strong!

386
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
You're so strong!

387
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Master Nie.

388
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
It's been a long time.

389
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Ye.

390
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
It's you.

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Master Nie.

394
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Master Nie.

395
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Master Nie.

396
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Master Nie.

397
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Master Nie.

398
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Master Nie.

399
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I'm not capable.

400
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I need to thank you.

401
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Who?

402
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Wen Xu

403
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
killed him.

404
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Yan Yang Hall

405
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
is a good show.

406
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Wang Yao.

407
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
You've made a good show

408
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
by yourself.

409
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
You don't want to see it.

410
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Master Wei.

411
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
What should we do now?

412
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Are we going to kill them?

413
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Master Nie.

414
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120

You've done so much for us.

417
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
How many people are there

418
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
in this world?

419
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Lan Zhan.

420
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
What other ways

421
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
can we escape from the heaven?

422
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
You.

423
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Master Nie.

424
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120

Master Nie.

432
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Master Nie.

433
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Master Nie.

434
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Master Nie.

435
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Master Nie.

436
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
Why?

437
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Why is there no movement?

438
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Who is it?

439
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Who is it?

440
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Master Nie.

441
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Master Nie.

442
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Master Nie.

443
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Master Nie.
