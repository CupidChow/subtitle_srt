00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 15

3
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,320
Yao clan of Pingyang, here to visit Clan Leader Jiang.

4
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,200
- Please get up. - Clan Leader Jiang.

5
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,240
Who did such brutal thing to Clan Leader Yao?

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,120
=Clan Leader Yao from Yao clan of Pingyang.

7
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,040
Clan Leader Jiang,
=Clan Leader Yao from Yao clan of Pingyang.

8
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,300
=Clan Leader Yao from Yao clan of Pingyang.

9
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,360
our Yao's disciples

10
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
after going through great loss,

11
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,480
finally ran back to Pingyang from Qishan

12
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,720
but still were slaughtered by Wen clan.

13
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
We Yao clan now

14
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
has been exterminated.

15
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,560
Clan Leader Jiang,

16
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
we escaped from Qishan,

17
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,680
so the Wens came for an account

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960
leading to the massacre of Yao clan.

19
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
We are the only two left.

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,960
Clan leader is severely wounded for protecting us.

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,800
We had a narrow escape

22
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
but have nowhere else to go.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Clan Leader Jiang, we need your aid.

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,920
Please help our Clan Leader.

25
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,720
Dad.

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
Wen Ruohan has ordered

27
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,240
to track the disciples who escaped from Qishan

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,520
and to exterminate their clans

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,280
with no exception.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,920
We Yao clan were isolated and weak

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,080
and never intended to contend with main clans.

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,840
I could never imagine we should be exterminated like this.

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,280
You just focus on healing yourself first.

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
Since you're here,

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,120
we Jiang clan of Yunmeng will try our best to protect you.

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
Thank you very much, Clan Leader Jiang.

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,720
You're welcome.

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Now. Get a suite tidied

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
and treat Clan Leader Yao's wounds.

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,200
Understood.

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,400
Come.

42
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,000
Clan Leader.

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Uncle Jiang.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,960
Dad.

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
Now that the Wens have showed their fangs,

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,280
I suppose they won't spare us easily.

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,600
For Clan Leader Yao and his follower,

48
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm afraid Lotus Cove is not safe either.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
I was just pondering over this.

50
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Wen Ruohan is slaughtering all cultivation clans rampantly.

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
At this moment,

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,800
I assume only the Jin clan of Lanling stands a chance.

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,270
But the Jin clan...

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
Uncle Jiang.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,830
Jin Zixuan is somewhat a decent person.

56
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,320
Even if Jin clan were not to rebel against Wen clan officially,

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
as long as Jin Zixuan is on our side,

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,280
I believe that Jin clan

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
won't sit there and watch the disciples of other clans

60
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,920
fall into Wen clan's hands.

61
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
That's right, dad.

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,200
For rescuing Xian,

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,760
I went to Lanling for reinforcements

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
with Childe Jin.

65
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,760
Such being the case,

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,440
I shall depart tomorrow

67
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,200
to escort Clan Leader Yao to Lanling.

68
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,760
Dad, let me go with you.

69
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,520
No.

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
Cheng, Xian.

71
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,760
You two shall stay and guard Lotus Cove.

72
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,880
Yes, uncle Jiang.

73
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,720
I'll be away for a few days.

74
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,240
During my absence,

75
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,240
you have to follow

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,760
the instructions from Cheng and Xian.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,520
Be diligent. No sloth.

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,560
Got it?

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
Yes, Clan Leader.

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
Dad, please rest assured.

81
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,720
I'll manage to defend Lotus Cove with all my efforts.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,520
Uncle Jiang, senior sister.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,680
Please come back soon.

84
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,600
Take care along the way.

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Got it.

86
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
Let's go.

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
Li.

88
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Li, come here.

89
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
As you came to say goodbye this morning,

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
I brought something for you.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,760
They are refreshments made by grandma Liu.

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,440
You can eat some in case you're hungry.

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,360
This is the medicine for rheumatism.

94
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840
If you...

95
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,800
If someone is attacked by his headache again,

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,920
tell him to take it.

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,720
Thank you, mom, on behalf of my dad.

98
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Don't bother.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm thinking for you health.

100
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
The journey to Lanling is very dangerous.

101
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,240
Be careful.

102
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,720
Now go.

103
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,080
Dad.

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,680
Let's go.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,360
The journey to Lanling is full of threats.

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
Why didn't dad take us?

107
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,400
Killing the Xuanwu

108
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,680
will be Wen clan's excuse to target at us.

109
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
Besides,

110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
if both of us leave,

111
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
who's responsible for Lotus Cove.

112
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Take it easy.

113
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,480
Uncle Jiang and senior sister,

114
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,320
they will spend just a few days to get there along the river.

115
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,760
They'll come back safe and sound.

116
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,520
Wen clan is so vicious that

117
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,680
they've even exterminated the minor clan

118
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
like Yao clan who had no feud

119
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,640
with them.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,920
How abominable.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,150
Wen clan's being ruthless

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
and lacks humanity.

123
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
It isn't new to us.

124
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,480
But they can even aim at minor clans like Yao.

125
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm afraid

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,840
a much bloody chaos will be incurred in the cultivation world.

127
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,800
Jiang Cheng.

128
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,360
We should come up with a scheme.

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Once Wen clan come at Lotus Cove,

130
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,280
what should we do to cope with that?

131
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,600
How to cope?

132
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll kill every last one

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
of the coming underlings of Wen clan.

134
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,960
What's the matter?

135
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,680
Father.

136
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,600
What happened to you?

137
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Have you got any clue of the whereabouts of Xue Yang?

138
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,680
Father,

139
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,080
I've sent people to search around.

140
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,560
No report yet.

141
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
Xue Yang is defiant

142
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
and making troubles everywhere.

143
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm afraid he has died at the hands of others.

144
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
Father, are you all right?

145
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Call Wen Qing here.

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,000
I need the acupuncture.

147
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,640
Didn't you send her and her brother

148
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
to Yiling?

149
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,720
Shall I call them back?

150
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,360
No.

151
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,840
The cave of the Slaughter Xuanwu in the Muxi Mountain.

152
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
You've sent people there.

153
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,800
What did they find?

154
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
They found that Xuanwu was already dead.

155
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,880
Dead?

156
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,640
The Slaughter Xuanwu

157
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,680
was the ancient mythic creature tamed by Xue Chonghai.

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,000
How could it just die like this?

159
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,280
Yes.

160
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,680
I suppose it must be that

161
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,000
Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji killed it together.

162
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,920
However I found

163
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,360
there was sign of seal in Xuanwu's heart.

164
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
There must be something repressing that beast there.

165
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,320
That's why we haven't noticed it before.

166
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
Where is the repressing thing?

167
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,320
Gone.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,240
Gone?

169
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,480
The thing that can repress the Slaughter Xuanwu for a hundred years

170
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,200
can't be ordinary.

171
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Find it out!

172
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Understood.

173
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,400
But father,

174
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,960
have you taken any other clans in Yunmeng into account?

175
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Just kill them

176
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
if you want.

177
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,360
Yes, father.

178
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
Let's stop here.

179
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
We should return.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
So early toady?

181
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
I've had enough.

182
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
Not interesting anymore.

183
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,760
By the way,

184
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,240
who are you that ranked rather low just now?

185
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,120
Just go fetch it with sixth junior brother.

186
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,200
First senior brother.

187
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Why I am always the one to fetch it?

188
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,880
That's not fair.

189
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
I didn't want to either.

190
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,760
But madam Yu won't let me go out.

191
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,440
She is home now.

192
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,840
Maybe Jingzhu or Yinzhu is hiding in some corner

193
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
spying on me

194
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,720
and is ready to report me at any time.

195
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,560
If I go out,

196
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,840
I'll be lashed by madam Yu

197
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
until a layer of my skin fall off.

198
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,640
First senior brother, you fear of nothing

199
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,040
but our ma'am Yu

200
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,480
and dogs.

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,560
You!

202
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
What are you guys talking about?

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,120
Go fetch those arrows now!

204
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,440
Go.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Let's go.

206
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,440
Make it quick.

207
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,360
Jiang Cheng,

208
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,520
uncle Jiang and senior sister have been away for about ten days.

209
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,480
When will they be back?

210
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,280
I received the letter from dad several days ago.

211
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,640
I guess they'll be back soon these days.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
I just wonder if we should consult with mom

213
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,520
to send people to greet them.

214
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
After such a long time,

215
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,480
I wonder if she's mollified.

216
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,920
Only if I can go out.

217
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
Whose kite is this?

218
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,960
It's mine.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
How dare you!

220
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
Seize him!

221
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,760
First senior brother!

222
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,960
Bad news! First senior brother!

223
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,440
First senior brother! First senior brother!

224
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,200
Sixth junior brother...

225
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,480
He was captured!

226
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,240
By who?

227
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,040
And why?

228
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,800
I don't know!

229
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
I don't know why he is captured.

230
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,440
Capture people out of no reason?

231
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,240
Calm down and make it clear.

232
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,240
Just...just now, we went to fetch the kites.

233
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,480
The kite fell over there.

234
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,160
Kinda far.

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,960
We went for it

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
and found dozens of people.

237
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,160
All from Wen clan.

238
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,800
The leader was a young woman.

239
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,120
She was holding a kite

240
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,360
with an arrow.

241
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,640
She asked who owned the kite when she saw us.

242
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,160
Sixth junior brother replied it was his.

243
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,120
The woman got angry,

244
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,760
said "how dare you!"

245
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,040
and seized sixth junior brother.

246
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,240
And then?

247
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
We asked for the reason.

248
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,840
She was yelling repeatedly that he was conspiring against them

249
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,880
and ordered her men to seize sixth junior brother.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,160
Kidnapping with no reason.

251
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,600
The Wen clan is going utterly out of control.

252
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,760
Yes. I agree.

253
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,000
The Wens have gone too far.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Quiet.

255
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,800
The Wens are coming.

256
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,480
Don't let them get the goods on us.

257
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,840
I ask you,

258
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,080
was the woman

259
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
carrying no sword

260
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
and looking flirtatious

261
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
with a mole on her face?

262
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,200
- Yes, that's her. - That's her!

263
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
Wang Lingjiao.

264
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,720
Wang Lingjiao such a...

265
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,080
What are you shouting about?

266
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
Can't I lead a peaceful life for one day?

267
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,120
Mom, the Wens are coming

268
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,520
and captured sixth junior brother.

269
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
You yelled so loud.

270
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,600
I already heard it inside.

271
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
What is the fuss?

272
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,120
He was captured not killed.

273
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Look at you.

274
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,320
So anxious and resentful, even stomp the ground.

275
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,840
Have you got any air of a future clan leader?

276
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,480
Calm down.

277
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
So-called Lotus Cove

278
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
is just so so.

279
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Madam Yu,

280
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
long time no see.

281
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,560
Lotus Cove is pretty good,

282
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,480
only that the wood is kinda dark.

283
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,680
Not bright.

284
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,350
Madam Yu,

285
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,070
I must say you are an awful host mother

286
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,040
who know little about decoration.

287
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,830
Here,

288
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,760
here,

289
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,280
and here.

290
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,200
If there is some red gauze,

291
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,560
it should look pretty.

292
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
Why you seize the disciple of Jiang clan of Yunmeng?

293
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,920
Seize?

294
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,360
You are referring to the one I just caught outside.

295
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,840
It's a long story.

296
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
Let's have a good talk.

297
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,720
Where is tea?

298
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,640
There is none,

299
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,360
if you don't serve yourself.

300
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,960
Don't your servants of Jiang clan do their work?

301
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,520
They have much more important work to do.

302
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,680
Doing such serving matter

303
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
dosen't need others' help

304
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,960
as a healthy person.

305
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,120
Madam Yu,

306
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
this is not good of you Jiang clan.

307
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,200
Servants can interrupt randomly in such public situation.

308
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,320
If it happened in our Wen clan,

309
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,200
such behavior means being slapped in the face.

310
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Jinzhu and Yinzhu are not some normal servants.

311
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,480
They've been serving me

312
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,920
since they were little.

313
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,720
No one can slap them.

314
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,720
No one can and no one dare.

315
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,640
Listen to what you've said, Madam Yu.

316
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,880
In the cultivation clan,

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
superiors and inferiors must be differentiated

318
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,120
or it will be chaos.

319
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,480
Servants are servants after all.

320
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
Right,

321
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
servants should act like servants.

322
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,080
However,

323
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,880
why did you seize our disciple of Jiang clan?

324
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Madam Yu,

325
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,440
I advise you to draw a clear boundary with that boy.

326
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,120
He was conspiring against us.

327
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,720
and caught by me on the site.

328
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Conspiring against you?

329
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,920
What can sixth junior brotehr conspire about?

330
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,360
Come,

331
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,240
let's show Madam Yu.

332
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,280
This is the proof.

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,880
What kind of proof is this?

334
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,760
It's just a kite with a one-eyed monster on it.

335
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,240
Do you think I'm blind?

336
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,760
Observe it!

337
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,680
What's the color of it?

338
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
And what's the shape of the one-eyed monster?

339
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,160
So?

340
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
So,

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,520
Madam Yu,

342
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,960
what looks round

343
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,040
and golden?

344
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,840
Sun.

345
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,240
So many kinds of kites.

346
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,800
Why did he choose to draw a one-eyed monster?

347
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
Why did he choose to make it golden?

348
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,520
Why not other shapes?

349
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Why not other colors?

350
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
You want to tell me it's a coincidence?

351
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,400
Impossible.

352
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160
He meant it.

353
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,360
He shot down the kite

354
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,760
to insinuate he want to shoot down the sun.

355
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
His wanting to shoot down the sun

356
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,600
is the biggest disrespect to us Wen clan of Qishan.

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,320
Couldn't I say he was conspiring against us?

358
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,440
The kite does look round and golden,

359
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,560
but it is far from the sun.

360
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
What's the resemblance?

361
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,720
As you say it,

362
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,000
oranges shouldn't be eaten anymore.

363
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,800
Oranges look golden

364
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
and round.

365
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,320
But I remember that you like oranges.

366
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,320
So you came this time

367
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
just for a kite?

368
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Of course not.

369
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,080
We came under Childe Wen's orders

370
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,240
to penalize a person.

371
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,360
This guy

372
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
back in Mount Muxi,

373
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,800
railed against our Childe and hindered him

374
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,640
when he was fighting a monster

375
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,000
dauntlessly,

376
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,480
which made our Childe tired and distracted

377
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,680
and almost fail.

378
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,320
He even lost his sword.

379
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
But our Childe is blessed

380
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
to have killed that monster at last

381
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,800
even without a sword.

382
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,600
I, on behalf of our Childe

383
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,920
ask madam Yu to penalize this guy

384
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,040
to set an example to

385
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,280
the other people in Jiang clan.

386
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,480
Mom.

387
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,480
Back off.

388
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
This Wei Ying

389
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,680
should be your servant in Jiang clan, right?

390
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,080
Considering Clan Leader Jiang's absence,

391
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,040
I suppose madam Yu can make the judge.

392
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,880
If there is anyone shielding him in your Jiang clan,

393
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,160
I may assume that

394
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,080
those old rumors

395
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,160
are real.

396
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,080
What rumors?

397
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,160
You know that, don't you?

398
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,120
Nothing but

399
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,120
some romantic affairs of Clan Leader Jiang.

400
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
You mean...

401
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,840
Mom.

402
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,720
Get aside, Cheng.

403
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,440
Or you'll kneel down too.

404
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,920
Jiang Cheng, stay out of this.

405
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Wei Wuxian!

406
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,480
I've already said it.

407
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
You...

408
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
You undisciplined bastard.

409
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,160
You're gonna bring Jiang clan a big trouble sooner or later.

410
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Stop!

411
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
Please stop, mom.

412
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Jiang Cheng,

413
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
get away from him.

414
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,360
Already done?

415
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Or what else?

416
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,600
This is it?

417
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
What do you mean?

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,240
What class do you think my Purple Lightening is?

419
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,320
Having taken this,

420
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
he can't get up until next month.

421
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,560
He'll suffer.

422
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
But he will heal one day, won't him?

423
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
What on earth do you want?

424
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,160
Madam Yu,

425
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
since this is a penalty,

426
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,480
you should let him

427
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,080
remember the lesson

428
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,760
and regret it for the rest of his life

429
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
without nerves to do it again.

430
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,080
Just some lashes.

431
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,280
Very soon,

432
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,760
he'll heal and get up fooling around again.

433
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,680
What kind of penalty is that?

434
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,760
Besides, lads at such young age

435
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,920
easily forget the pain once he heals.

436
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,280
This is nothing like penalty.

437
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
What do you want then?

438
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
Chop off his legs

439
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,960
to let him stay down forever?

440
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,360
For our Childe Wen's mercy,

441
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,600
we won't do brutal things

442
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,920
like chopping off someone's legs.

443
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,480
You need only to chop off his right hand.

444
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,320
That should satisfy Childe Wen.

445
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,400
Chopping off his right hand?

446
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,800
That's right.

447
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,480
Mom.

448
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,160
Mom, please don't.

449
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
She didn't tell the truth.

450
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,400
Madam Yu,

451
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,640
you'd better think it over.

452
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,480
We Wen clan of Qishan won't quit

453
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,000
before there is a decent result.

454
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll bring back the hand you chop off.

455
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
With a result,

456
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,480
you Jiang clan of Yunmeng will be fine.

457
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,320
Or it's not so easy a case

458
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,680
when our Childe come in person.

459
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,160
Jinzhu, Yinzhu.

460
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,760
Close the doors.

461
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,880
Don't let blood be showed to others.

462
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,160
Yes, madam.

463
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,080
Mom.

464
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,720
Mom, mother!

465
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,280
Well then.

466
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
If it can bring peace back,

467
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,160
one hand is worthwhile.

468
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,080
Mother.

469
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,480
At the worst I can practice left-hand sword arts from now on.

470
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,960
Madam Yu, I start to adore you.

471
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,000
We'll get along well in the supervisory office

472
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,800
in the future.

473
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,080
Supervisory office?

474
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,400
Yes, the supervisory office.

475
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,320
It's my second errand in Yunmeng.

476
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,880
We Wen clan has newly issued the Supervisory Order.

477
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,480
One supervisory office for every city.

478
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,320
Now I declare

479
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,240
Lotus Cove is the new supervisory office of Wen clan

480
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,760
in Yunmeng.

481
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
What supervisory office?

482
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
This is my home.

483
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,240
Madam Yu,

484
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
I advise you

485
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,000
to discipline your son properly.

486
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,960
For hundreds of years,

487
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,880
all other clans should kneel down before Wen clan.

488
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,280
In the presence of Wen's emissary,

489
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,800
how could you say something like your home?

490
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
I thought the Lotus Cove was old

491
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,880
and had some traitors

492
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,760
so you are not equal to it.

493
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,120
However,

494
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,080
I can see you are obedient

495
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,440
and I like your temper.

496
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,800
So I decide to grant you the right...

497
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,520
You reckless mean maid.

498
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
You should pick the owner before you kick a dog.

499
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
How dare you barge into my house,

500
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,120
and penalize my family member before me.

501
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
Who do you think you are?

502
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
How can you be so impertinent.

503
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,680
How dare you!

504
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,280
I tell you,

505
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,640
Wen clan of Qishan and Wang clan of Yingchuan

506
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,960
won't spare you!

507
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,280
Shut up!

508
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,720
You mean maid.

509
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,760
We Yu clan of Meishan have existed in cultivation world for hundred years.

510
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,560
Never heard of some Wang clan of Yingchuan.

511
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,760
What filthy gutter did you come from?

512
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,880
Low clan.

513
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,200
Is the whole clan full of low beings like you?

514
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,880
You dared bring up the talk of superiors and inferiors.

515
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,720
Let me tell you what are superiors and inferiors.

516
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm superior.

517
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,800
You're inferior.

518
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,520
Do you think you can bury the truth by killing me?

519
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,560
Do you think Childe Wen doesn't know I'm here?

520
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,680
Let me tell you,

521
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,160
Childe Wen will be here soon.

522
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,880
You!

523
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
He won't spare any of you!

524
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,600
You're talking like you're sparing us just now.

525
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,680
Do you know I am Childe Wen's people?

526
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,440
I'm closest to him!

527
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,000
If he knows what you did to me,

528
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,040
he will absolutely...

529
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
So what?

530
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,640
Chopping off hands or legs?

531
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,120
Or burn down our mansion?

532
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,240
Or send out an army of ten thousand people

533
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,240
to reduce our Lotus Cove into ruins?

534
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,160
Or set up the supervisory office?

535
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
Stay away! Stay away!

536
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,680
What do you want?

537
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,920
Stop there!

538
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,400
Wen Zhuliu!

539
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
Wen Zhuliu! Save me!

540
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,800
Cores Crusher?!

541
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,680
Purple Spider.

542
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,760
Wen Zhuliu, what are you waiting for?

543
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,400
Kill her! Kill her!

544
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,520
You original name was Zhao Zhuliu, right?

545
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,600
It wasn't Wen.

546
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,400
So desperately want to change your surname.

547
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,400
You guys fell over yourselves to get it.

548
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,880
How can the surname Wen be so precious

549
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,640
that it made you betray your ancestors?

550
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Hilarious.

551
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
Just serving my master.

552
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,080
Wen Zhuliu, why are you still talking?

553
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
Can't you see the situation I'm in?

554
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,640
Childe Wen sent you to protect me.

555
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,840
This is your way?

556
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,080
You'd better be careful. I'll report you!

557
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,880
Excuse my offence.

558
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
Hypocritical.

559
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,640
Jiang Cheng!

560
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,520
Go stop her!

561
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,920
Stop her from setting off the signal!

562
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Watch out! Madam Yu!

563
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,560
Mom!

564
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,920
Come here quickly!

565
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,960
Go!

566
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,160
Cheng.

567
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,920
Thank god, the wound is not severe.

568
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,880
Mom.

569
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
What should we do?

570
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
What should you do?

571
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,400
Haven't you seen that

572
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,960
they are prepared.

573
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
The fight is inevitable today.

574
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,760
Many pursuers will arrive soon.

575
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,760
You go first.

576
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,440
What if uncle Jiang and senior sister...

577
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
You shut up!

578
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
It's all your

579
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,240
fault.

580
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,880
Mom.

581
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,800
Why do you give me the Purple Lightening?

582
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,040
It's yours now. From now on.

583
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,000
The Purple Lightening has accept you as its master.

584
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,960
Mother.

585
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,680
Don't you go with us?

586
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,150
You damn boy.

587
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,520
Hateful! Extremely!

588
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,000
Look!

589
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,080
Because of you,

590
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,230
what disaster has happened to our clan?

591
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,360
Mother,

592
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,230
don't you go with us?

593
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,800
Mother!

594
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Mother!

595
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,710
Mother! Mother!

596
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,190
It'll loose where it's safe.

597
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,520
If you encounter any enemy,

598
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,960
Purple Lightening will protect you.

599
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,360
Listen up! Wei Ying!

600
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,200
Protect Jiang Cheng.

601
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,600
With your own life! Got it!

602
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,320
Madam Yu!

603
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Stop wasting time!

604
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,840
Did you understand it or not?

605
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,240
Mother!

606
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Dad... Dad isn't home yet.

607
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,280
There is nothing we couldn't share together!

608
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
It's OK even if he doesn't return.

609
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,960
Without him, I'm fine.

610
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,560
Mom!

611
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,120
Mom! Mom!

612
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,520
Mom!

613
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,240
Mother!

614
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,800
Mother!

615
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,520
Mother!

616
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
Mother!

617
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,480
Mother!

618
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,240
Why still bonding!

619
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,160
Why! Why!

620
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,440
Loose it!

621
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,360
Loose it now!

622
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,400
Loose!

623
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
- Loose it! - Jiang Cheng!

624
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,960
Listen to me!

625
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Calm down!

626
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
Madam versus the Cores Crusher.

627
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,760
It's not a decided battle!

628
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,360
Didn't she

629
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,120
pin down that Wen Zhuliu?

630
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,520
How can I calm down?

631
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
How?

632
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,280
Even if Wen Zhuliu is killed,

633
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,120
Wang Lingjiao had set off the signal.

634
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,320
What if Wen Chao

635
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
sends an army to besiege our family?

636
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,880
Jiang Cheng!

637
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,560
Look!

638
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,800
It's uncle Jiang and senior sister.

639
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,280
- Uncle Jiang! - Dad!

640
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
- Senior sister! - Set us free now!

641
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,560
Let us go back to Lotus Cove!

642
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,880
Uncle Jiang!

643
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,200
- Dad! - Uncle Jiang!

644
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,800
Dad.

645
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,560
It sounds like Xian and Cheng.

646
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,680
- Senior sister! - Dad!

647
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Quickly. Pull up to the boat!

648
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,600
Dad!

649
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,000
Dad!

650
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,600
Cheng! Ying!

651
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,520
This is...

652
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,640
Uncle Jiang.

653
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
- Dad. - What happened?

654
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,240
Why are you bound by the Purple Lightening

655
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,240
sitting here?

656
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,640
Where is your mom?

657
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Why did she bind you?

658
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,920
Dad, set us free!

659
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,200
The Purple Lightening belongs to your mom.

660
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
It can recognize owner.

661
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,440
I'm afraid it won't let me...

662
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Dad, sister.

663
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,520
The Wens barged into our house.

664
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,040
Mom quarreled with them

665
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,640
and started to fight with that Cores Crusher.

666
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,240
I fear he would get the upper hand.

667
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,760
And someone just set off the signal.

668
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,840
It won't be long

669
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,160
before more enemies arrive here.

670
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,240
Dad. Let's get back to help her!

671
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,840
Let's get back now. Dad.

672
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,480
Cores Crusher...

673
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,920
Dad. Let's go back now.

674
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
- Dad. - Dad!

675
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,560
Listen. All three of you.

676
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
Don't turn your direction.

677
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,720
Don't go back to Lotus Cove.

678
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,960
Try to get to Meishan once you land.

679
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
Go to your grandmother.

680
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,160
- Dad! - Uncle Jiang! - Dad!

681
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,960
I go back for my wife.

682
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,320
Dad. Let's go back to mom together!

683
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,520
Dad!

684
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,720
You three must be safe and sound.

685
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,720
- Uncle Jiang! - Dad!

686
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
- Dad! - If something go wrong with you,

687
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,040
we won't be safe and sound either!

688
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,360
Dad!

689
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,920
Dad!

690
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,920
Dad!

691
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,960
Dad!

692
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Little fool.

693
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Don't cry.

694
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,600
I didn't say that I wouldn't be back.

695
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,200
Dad

696
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,800
Li, don't cry now.

697
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,240
Don't cry now.

698
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,160
- Dad! - Ying.

699
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,040
You must watch out for

700
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,840
Cheng and Li. Always.

701
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,040
- Dad! -Uncle Jiang!

702
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,760
- Dad! - Dad!

703
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,120
- Dad! - Dad!

704
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
- Dad! - Dad!

705
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,560
- Uncle Jiang! - Dad!

706
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,760
Dad!

707
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,600
Dad!

708
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,480
Dad!

709
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,600
Dad!

710
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,280
Dad! Dad...

711
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,160
- Dad! - Uncle Jiang!

712
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,200
Dad!

713
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,360
Dad!
