00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one to be released.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one to be released.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one to be released.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one to be released.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mosque Ci

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
replenishment

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
despair

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
รณ

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,860
She's also very good at Yayu-like things.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:42,520
She really can defeat all those

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,720
enemies with any results.

36
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,360
Right after the last scroll,

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
He can only tear her away if she's in the library.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
No.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Qing Guangyao has a very strong desire to know.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
She can't remember this night because of her death.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
She wants to come to a dead end.

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
But if one day, Dongchuan will be released,

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,360
she won't be able to find out the source of the mystery.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
She's very cautious in everything.

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,360
She's very careful in front of you.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Chi Feng is not the most ambitious person.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
She's heard you talk about the mystery.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360
So she has a great impression on the mystery.

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,360
So she doesn't dare to tell him about the mystery.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,360
She isn't careful enough to absorb characters' emotions.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,360
This will prevent him from doing nothing.

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,360
What about me?

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Erchye, I was an experimenter a long time ago.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Everything started on my chair.

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,360
But if he can understand the mystery,

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
then I can beat him with some risky horses.

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,600
So, it's not enough to tell you that

59
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,960
there's a part of it

60
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,580
that is now called the ale aperitif by Jin Guangyao.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,020
Even though he can't find an escape

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
I have never signed here

63
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,320
about the hoped sort of information.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,260
Ms. Lan, I have absolutely no idea.

65
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,260
This face-to-face gentleman was a spy in the Buye Tian City of Qizhan.

66
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
And he was a spy who was successful.

67
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,260
He even found the secret room of Wen Ruohan.

68
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,260
And he was so into it.

69
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
He prepared all the maps and scrolls.

70
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,260
And he wrote a letter to Jinling Tai.

71
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
In front of him,

72
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,260
your Lanzha's library is really nothing.

73
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Here it comes.

74
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
I appreciate it.

75
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,260
I'll try my best.

76
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
Out of all the brothers and sisters in the Buye Tian City,

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,100
Now that it is a event,

78
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,180
his Featherality dev NT ahora

79
00:05:49,540 --> 00:06:02,140
has exceeded the grasp coconut

80
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,900
I've been sent

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,900
to Prince of Sing.

82
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
Prince of Sing, I see brighter

83
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,940
and the brightRon

84
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,540
And the light in everyone's eyes

85
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,740
is completely different.

86
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
For so many years,

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,540
in my heart,

88
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,340
he has always been a person of humiliation,

89
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,140
a person of great joy,

90
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,940
a person of great honor.

91
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,540
I have always been determined

92
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,540
that everyone's complaints about him

93
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,740
are all because of misunderstanding.

94
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,340
What I see is the most real thing.

95
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,540
You all let me believe right now

96
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,540
that everything he has in front of me is fake.

97
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
He designed the murder of his own brother.

98
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,540
I am also in his design.

99
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
I even

100
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,540
still hold his arm.

101
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Can you allow me to be more cautious

102
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
and make more judgments?

103
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
I will go to the Sword Uncle's Mansion.

104
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
I will take Childe Wei back.

105
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
You can come back later.

106
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
Lord Zewu.

107
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Childe Wei, what's the matter?

108
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
While Lan Zhan is not here,

109
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,940
I have something to ask you.

110
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Childe Wei, what is it?

111
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Well,

112
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,940
how did Lan Zhan's shoulder

113
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
get hurt?

114
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Childe Wei, don't you know?

115
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I asked him,

116
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
but he didn't want to say

117
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
that I had to ask you.

118
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Forget it.

119
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
I will go back to the Sword Uncle's Mansion.

120
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
I know him the best.

121
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
If I don't do it,

122
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,940
I am afraid I will forget

123
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,940
this matter in my life.

124
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Let me tell you.

125
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Childe Wei, you still remember

126
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
that the poor thing

127
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
killed General Wen Ning

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
in the time of Jin Zixuan.

129
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
After that, Wen Qing

130
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
took the Wen clan

131
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
to the Capital.

132
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Lord Han Guang.

133
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
What do you mean?

134
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
If you keep Wei Ying

135
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
for the rest of the day,

136
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
we will not

137
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
search the old court.

138
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
What are you doing?

139
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
You have no right

140
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
to talk to me.

141
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
You!

142
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
Lord Su.

143
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Forget it.

144
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Lord Han Guang is indeed a man.

145
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Since Lord Han Guang

146
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
doesn't allow us to search,

147
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
let's stay in a place

148
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,940
where we can stay.

149
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
The whole mess

150
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
has been surrounded by us.

151
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
Even if the old clan of Yiling

152
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
is lucky and not dead,

153
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,940
it is impossible for the God

154
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
to appear

155
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
in this place.

156
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Yes.

157
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,940
Oh, right.

158
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
Lord Han Guang,

159
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
your uncle is here.

160
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
It seems

161
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
you are going back

162
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
to the Cloud Recesses.

163
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
The chaos is in Hong Kong.

164
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,940
The capital is in danger.

165
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
There are many chaos.

166
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Uncle is furious.

167
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
He took him back to the Cloud Recesses

168
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
and took 300 soldiers.

169
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Han Tan is dead.

170
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,940
He has to go to the back of the mountain

171
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,940
in three years.

172
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Shoot!

173
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Shoot!

174
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
The Blue Claw is in danger.

175
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
What is the 52nd one?

176
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
We can't reveal the secret.

177
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
The Blue Claw is a secret.

178
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
You are going to kill me

179
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
because you are going to kill me?

180
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
You are going to face the Blue Claw?

181
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Yes.

182
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Uncle,

183
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
you are going to kill me

184
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
because you are going to kill me?

185
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
Yes.

186
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
I am going to kill you.

187
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Hong Ji,

188
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
you are going to kill me?

189
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
I am going to kill you.

190
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
I have been looking for

191
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Wang Ji's secret.

192
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
I have also been looking for him.

193
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
But he told me

194
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,940
that he thought you were a spy.

195
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,940
He should believe you.

196
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Why?

197
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
Childe Wei,

198
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
do you know

199
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,940
where this house is?

200
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Do you know where it is?

201
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
I don't know.

202
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
This is the place

203
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
where my mother

204
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
was hiding in the Cloud Recesses.

205
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Childe Wei might feel weird

206
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
as the wife of the family.

207
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Why didn't she follow the family

208
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
to the South?

209
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
Childe Wei might know

210
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
that my father was always

211
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,940
a spy.

212
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
He didn't ask about the truth.

213
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,940
The things about the Claw

214
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,940
were almost all because of me.

215
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
I know that.

216
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,940
My father was always a spy

217
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,940
because of my mother.

218
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
It's said that he was a spy.

219
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
It's better to say that

220
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
he was a spy.

221
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
When my father was young,

222
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,940
he went back to the city overnight.

223
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
He met my mother

224
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,940
outside the Claw City.

225
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
He said he was a kind hearted person.

226
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
He is also a kind hearted person.

227
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Unfortunately,

228
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
my father was not kind hearted.

229
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,940
He killed my father's master.

230
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Why?

231
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
I don't know.

232
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
But I think it's just

233
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
because he was kind hearted.

234
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
After my father knew that

235
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
he was in pain.

236
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,940
But he left again

237
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
and secretly took my mother

238
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
to the place where the Cloud Recesses was.

239
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
He didn't care about the enemy

240
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
and didn't want to be with him.

241
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,940
And he also told the people in the tribe

242
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
that he loved his wife all his life.

243
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
If anyone touches him,

244
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
he will be in trouble.

245
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
After my mother got married,

246
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
my father found a house.

247
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
He locked my mother up.

248
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
He found another house

249
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
and locked himself up.

250
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
He was called a concubine.

251
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,940
He died.

252
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Childe Wei.

253
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Can you understand

254
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
the purpose of my father doing this?

255
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Do you think

256
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
he did it right?

257
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,940
I don't know.

258
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
My father did it

259
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
because he didn't mean it.

260
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
When I and Wang Ji were born,

261
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
he immediately

262
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,940
sent us out

263
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
and took care of the others.

264
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
When it's bigger,

265
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
he taught me how to be a father.

266
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
I was so happy

267
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
to have a father like him.

268
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Plus, because of my mother,

269
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
I ruined my father's life.

270
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
So, my father

271
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
was more hateful

272
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
and was so stubborn.

273
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
He was so stubborn.

274
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,940
He taught me

275
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
how to be a father.

276
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,940
He was so strict.

277
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Every time I went to see him with Wang Ji,

278
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
he never complained

279
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
that he was locked up here

280
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
and was so hard-working.

281
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
He didn't ask about our homework.

282
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Although Wang Ji never said

283
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
that he would be back,

284
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
I know

285
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
he was waiting

286
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
for his mother to see him every month.

287
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
I was still the same.

288
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
But one day,

289
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
my uncle told us

290
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
that we don't need to go anymore.

291
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
My mother was gone.

292
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
A good word from my mother.

293
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Is she perished?

294
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
Sorry to keep you waiting.

295
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
I was just worrying about her.

296
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
I might regret Supercaric.

297
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
It's not important

298
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Wang Ji still comes here every month.

299
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Sitting under the long net, waiting for someone to open the door for him.

300
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,940
When he gets bigger,

301
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,940
we all know that mother won't come back.

302
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
No one will open the door for him.

303
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
But he still comes back.

304
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Wang Ji has always been a good girl.

305
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
So, Mr. Wei,

306
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,940
that year, Wang Ji saw you taking a nap.

307
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
He didn't say anything, but I knew

308
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
that his inner pain and confusion

309
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
were just like what mother saw that year.

310
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
The day after the death of Wang Ji,

311
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
he was taken to the hospital.

312
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
He was taken to the hospital

313
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
and taken to the hospital.

314
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
He was taken to the hospital

315
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,940
and taken to the hospital.

316
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
He was taken to the hospital

317
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,940
and taken to the hospital.

318
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,940
He was taken to the hospital

319
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
and taken to the hospital.

320
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940
He was taken to the hospital.

321
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
I have already told Wang Ji

322
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,940
that the situation is now on my head.

323
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
I only knew

324
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,940
that the decision was so difficult.

325
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,940
I thought I was his person for so many years.

326
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
But...

327
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,940
Maybe the world is full of people.

328
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,940
They always hate the fire

329
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,940
and the illness.

330
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,940
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Lan Zhan.

345
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
What's the matter?

346
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Thank you.

347
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
I mean...

353
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Your brother

354
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,940
was hit a lot this time.

355
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
But it was.

356
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
After all, he is Jin Guangyao.

357
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
He is his brother.

358
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
If you change the number of the seats,

359
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
I'll give you a request.

360
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Find the evidence.

361
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
She won't mostly know about it.

362
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
Help yourself.

363
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,940
Even if he is twin,

364
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
he is also your brother.

365
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,900
He is also bizim

366
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
Lan family's standard.

367
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
What?

368
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
You didn't tell him?

369
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,940
What did you tell him?

370
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
In Qiong Qi Road,

371
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
there is a sound of a flute.

372
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
You know?

373
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
I asked Wen Ning.

374
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
In Qiong Qi Road,

375
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
he heard two sounds of the flute.

376
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,940
In Qiong Qi Road, he heard two sounds of the flute.

377
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,940
When it happened,

378
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
I thought it was my fault.

379
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Until at the night sky,

380
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,940
I heard that sound again.

381
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
That sound.

382
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
That sound.

383
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
I was confused at that time.

384
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
I couldn't figure it out.

385
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
I thought it carefully.

386
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
What's the problem?

387
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:15,940
After I woke up,

388
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
I dreamed back to my father.

389
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
I believed that

390
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,940
what I heard was not a mistake.

391
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
And after today,

392
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
I believed that

393
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,940
in Qiong Qi Road and the night sky,

394
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
someone behind me

395
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
used the broken spell

396
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
to change the order of Chen Qing.

397
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
It was Jin Guang Yong.

398
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Maybe it was.

399
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Maybe it wasn't.

400
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
You don't want to know the answer?

401
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
When I woke up,

402
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
I really wanted to know the answer.

403
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
But now,

404
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
I just want to say

405
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
whatever you want to say,

406
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
just tell her.

407
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
Lan Zhan,

408
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
I really think

409
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
I know it now and don't know it.

410
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
It's not important to me.

411
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Anyway, in the hearts of people,

412
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
I must have done something bad.

413
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
Even if I run out now

414
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
and make 100 promises,

415
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm afraid no one will believe me.

416
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Actually, sometimes,

417
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,940
people just need an excuse.

418
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,940
Or a stick,

419
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
a stick that everyone calls.

420
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
If I have it,

421
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
they can fight with me

422
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
and they can live a life without any trouble.

423
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
I thought about it later.

424
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Even if I don't have Jin Guang Yong,

425
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
if I don't have that enemy,

426
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
there might be others.

427
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
I don't know

428
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
if there are others.

429
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Other people.

430
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
I can't say it clearly.

431
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
I can't say it clearly.

432
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
If you really believe me,

433
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,940
come to my rescue.

434
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,940
We actually have to run!

435
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
The rest of you believe that my people are dead.

436
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Wen Nian.

437
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Senior Sister.

438
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
Thank god.

439
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,940
There is still a heart in this world.

440
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Lan Zhan.

441
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Please.

442
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,940
Life is full of miracles.

443
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,940
It's all a miracle.

444
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Wutan.

445
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,940
I'm just a little bit of a loser.

446
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
It's all my fault.

447
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
I'm just a little bit of a loser.

448
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Wutan.

449
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Lan Zhan.

450
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
I'm sorry.

451
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
Thank you.

452
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
Wutan.

455
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,940
Wutan.

456
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Why did you do this?

457
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
I'm sorry.

458
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
I've given you this.

459
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
I've never been in this kind of trouble.

460
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
I've been in this for years.

461
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Now that I've lost it,

462
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
I should let it go.

463
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
I'm sorry.

467
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
I'm sorry.

468
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
I'm sorry.

469
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
I'm sorry.

470
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
I'm sorry.

471
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
What's the matter?

472
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,940
There is still no news from Lord Han and the Yiling.

473
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,940
I don't want people to find out where the Cloud Recesses are.

474
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Many families are already in a mess.

475
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
It's very meaningful.

476
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
If you are convenient,

477
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
I'll open a time.

478
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I'll bring someone to handle it.

479
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
Brother.

480
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
What's the matter?

481
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
Wushu.

482
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
If you forget it,

483
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
you don't have to.

484
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Lord Han is a official of the Yiling.

485
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
He has been in the public for many years.

486
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
He must have been fooled.

487
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Besides, he hasn't done anything

488
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
that can't be returned.

489
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,940
We can talk about it later.

490
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
I won't let others

491
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
have the chance to talk about it.

492
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
But...

493
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
When?

494
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,940
After the mess.

495
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
The mess?

496
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
After the war in the Yiling Taiyi,

497
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
there was a dream on the way to the mess.

498
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Kui Lei appeared again.

499
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,940
They all went to the mess.

500
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
What are they doing?

501
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
I don't know.

502
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Maybe Wei Wuxian has sent some sort of method.

503
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Or he used the Eagle's talisman to summon Kui Lei.

504
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
At the Yiling Taiyi,

505
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
he was given a piece of the Yiling.

506
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
Can he do these things?

507
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Brother.

508
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
Wei Wuxian was the one who sent

509
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
the Jiang clan and the Jiang clan to the mess.

510
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
What did he do?

511
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
He went back to the mess

512
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
and summoned Kui Lei.

513
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,940
What's the problem

514
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
with the Yiling Tent?

515
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
It's too much of a chance.

516
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
So,

517
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
I'm afraid there will be

518
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
a second mess in the future.

519
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I've informed some other family members

520
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,940
to go to the Yiling Taiyi.

521
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
Brother.

522
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,940
Are you coming?

523
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
Okay.

524
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
Go and wait outside.

525
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,940
I'll go with you.

526
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,940
Okay.

527
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Brother.

528
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Do you want to go see Big Brother?

529
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,940
I'm going to make a mess for Big Brother.

530
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Brother.

531
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,940
Are you going to send Big Brother to the last city?

532
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
I'm going to the Yiling Taiyi.

533
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
You go to the mess.

534
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
Do some work.

535
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Yes.

536
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
If he really has a will,

537
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
I won't let him down.

538
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
I know.

539
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
I'll go with you.

540
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
I'll go with you.

541
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
I'll go with you.

542
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
I'll go with you.

543
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Little Apple.

544
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Let's go.

545
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Let's go.

546
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Little Apple.

547
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
Hey, they're not responding.

548
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,940
Look, they only love you.

549
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,940
They recognize you.

550
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
Don't run away.

551
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
You can't run away from my palm.

552
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
Stay here.

553
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
By the way, Lan Zhan.

554
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
It's weird.

555
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,940
I know this trip is very difficult.

556
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,940
But I'm not afraid at all.

557
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,940
It's weird.

558
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,940
You go first.

559
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,940
I'm going.

560
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
Let's go.

561
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
Okay.

562
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Little Tootoo.

563
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Let's go.

564
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Let's go, Little Apple.

565
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Let's go.

566
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Little Apple.

567
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
They can't bear to see you.

568
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,940
I didn't expect Lord Han Guang to like these animals.

569
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
I can't do it.

570
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
No.

571
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Look.

572
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
The one who goes on the ground,

573
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
the one who goes on the water,

574
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
the one who flies on the sky,

575
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
I'll run away.

576
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Right, Little Apple?

577
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Say something.

578
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,940
You're not going to say anything.

579
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Little Apple.

580
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
Lord Han Guang, wait for me.

581
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
Let's go, Little Apple.

582
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,940
Wait for me.

583
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
Let's go, Little Apple.

584
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Little Apple.

585
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,940
What should I blow next?

586
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,940
Little Apple.

587
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Little Apple.

588
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
Nan Zhan, let me ask you.

589
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
The song you sang at the top of the cliff

590
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
in the Muxi Mountain

591
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
is called what?

592
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Why did you ask this?

593
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
Just say it.

594
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
What's the name?

595
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,940
I think I've guessed it.

596
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
How did you recognize me?

597
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
Say it.

598
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
What song?

599
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Who did it?

600
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,940
I did it.

601
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,940
You did it?

602
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,940
What's the name?

603
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
What do you think?

604
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
You're asking me a question?

605
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,940
I think it's called...

606
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,940
Drink it.

607
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,940
Get some water.

608
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,940
Lord Han Guang,

609
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
are you home?

610
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
Lord Han Guang,

611
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
let's change.

612
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Don't forget.

613
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,940
Don't be alone.

614
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
I'm here.

615
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,940
It's dangerous.

616
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Mian Mian,

617
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,940
I've told you many times.

618
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Don't run around when you're out.

619
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,940
You're still going to go alone.

620
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
Tell me.

621
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
What's the matter?

622
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,940
I'm going to go to the Muxi Mountain.

623
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
Qian Chong,

624
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,900
if the Yiling Laozu who died on the jade

625
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
and his ghost general

626
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
really met with him,

627
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
you'll be dead.

628
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,940
What do you think

629
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
I and your mother should do?

630
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
I'm not afraid.

631
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Mother said that

632
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,940
those stories are all fake.

633
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Yiling Laozu won't bully good people.

634
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
Qian Yang,

635
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
look, he's still talking.

636
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
Okay, Mian Mian.

637
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
Listen to father.

638
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,940
Mian Mian.

639
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Who's there? Come out.

640
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
There's no one.

641
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
Come out.

642
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Lord Han.

643
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
No matter who it is,

644
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,940
it's a person anyway.

645
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
It's not a thing.

646
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
You're Wei.

647
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,940
Do you know this lady?

648
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
I've heard her name before.

649
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,940
No.

650
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
I don't know her name.

651
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,940
She's called Qingyang.

652
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
Mian Mian.

653
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
You're Mian Mian.
