00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 07

3
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,840
For so many years,

4
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,680
my spiritual cognition has been guarding this place,

5
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
the forbidden area of Lan clan.

6
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,240
Since then no one dare step in.

7
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,560
How about my grandmaster then?

8
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,800
Your grandmaster?

9
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,120
Honestly speaking,

10
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm Wei Wuxian.

11
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Although I was adopted by Jiang as a child,

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Zangse Wanderer is my mother,

13
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,400
Baoshan Wanderer is my grandmaster.

14
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,200
It turns out to be so many years.

15
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
At that time,

16
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
Baoshan Wanderer had no disciple,

17
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
but now

18
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,520
she even has a disciple's disciple

19
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,400
who now stands in front of me.

20
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
What a pity.

21
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,440
Since I led to the trouble,

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
she has lived in seclusion,

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,360
and I was too shameful to seek her.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
Predecessor,

25
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
I also have a question to ask.

26
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Are you the one who lead us into this place?

27
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
Not me.

28
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,520
I use my spiritual power to suppress the Yin Iron

29
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,160
in a century to preserve the wards in the back hill.

30
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,400
Yet in recent decade,

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
the Yin Iron reveals traces to be activated.

32
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,960
My spiritual power weakens.

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm afraid

34
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,200
the grievance of the Yin Iron has immersed into water.

35
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,440
Predecessor,

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,520
why the Yin Iron would be like this in recent two decades?

37
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
If my guess is right,

38
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,160
the other shards of the Yin Iron have appeared .

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,120
It can be assumed

40
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,480
the cultivator snatched of spirit

41
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
we saw last time

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,720
is a puppet,

43
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
they made the same way of Xue Chonghai.

44
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,840
They are testing.

45
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Since I broke the seal,

46
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,840
shards of the Yin Iron were able to sense each other.

47
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm so lucky to live to one hundred year's old.

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,840
The day

49
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
comes anyway.

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,760
Predecessor.

51
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
Are there any other methods

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
to prevent the Yin Iron to bring disaster to people?

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
The Yin Iron is the spirit of the heaven and the earth

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
which can't be eradicated,

55
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,880
the grievance came after it was broken into pieces.

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,120
Evil things will follow to places where it lies,

57
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,640
The only way is to find these shards back,

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,360
and repress them in the cold pond.

59
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,640
Yet,

60
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,520
I'm unable to remedy my mistake by myself.

61
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,600
Predecessor.

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,360
Don't panic.

63
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
My final day is coming soon.

64
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,480
I live to repay my debt.

65
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,800
Now you come here,

66
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
I don't need to manage with efforts.

67
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
As descendant of Lan clan, I'll try my best

68
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,840
to accomplish your wish

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,000
to find the Yin Iron and seal it under the cold pond.

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Me too.

71
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
It's domestic affair of Lan clan. None of your business.

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Lan Zhan. You can't stop me anyway.

73
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Although I grew up in Jiang clan of Yunmeng,

74
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,320
I can tell what's justice and what's not.

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,120
Besides, my grandmaster secluded a century for the Yin Iron.

76
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,240
It's part of my duty anyway.

77
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,760
As a disciple of Baoshan, you are right .

78
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,280
Remember,

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
to solve the problem of the Yin Iron,

80
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,560
there must be many barriers.

81
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Anyway,

82
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,240
I hope you can avoid the mistake I made.

83
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,160
Please be assured.

84
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,080
I'll do my utmost.

85
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,200
Predecessor.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,120
You haven't told us yet

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
where are the other pieces.

88
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,080
Does Cloud Recesses set an enchantment at the back hill

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,880
just to protect the mountain?

90
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,400
Lady Wen.

91
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,840
Childe Jiang.

92
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,680
Lady Wen.

93
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
Are you here to seek Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji too?

94
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,400
Lan Zhan.

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,920
Lan Zhan, I didn't mean to.

96
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
Wei Wuxian.

97
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,600
Jiang Cheng.

98
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,150
Get up.

99
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
OK, sure.

100
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
Wen Qing, Jiang Cheng.

101
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,160
Why are you here?

102
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
This question should be asked by me.

103
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
Wei Wuxian,

104
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
where did you go for the day and the night?

105
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,520
Do you know my sister was too worried

106
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,200
to eat or sleep well?

107
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,450
If I can't find you,

108
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,760
I have to send a letter to Lotus Cove to inform my father.

109
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,080
A day and a night has passed.

110
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,240
Yes.

111
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,880
Zewu Jun also has been looking for you

112
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
without rest.

113
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,400
Do you know that everyone is worrying about you?

114
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,080
Where did you go?

115
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
I'll tell you after we go back.

116
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
It's a long story.

117
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,080
Wait.

118
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,840
There is a sense of coldness between your eyebrows.

119
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
What is it

120
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
inside the place?

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,680
We wanted to cure our injuries in the Cold Spring.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,240
But we were carried away by a swirl of rapid water

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
and to a place extremely cold.

124
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,120
What place?

125
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,760
How could this happen in Cloud Recesses?

126
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
We were trapped for so long

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
and swam also for long time,

128
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
exhaust our strength

129
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,880
to find this exit.

130
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
What's inside?

131
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,800
- There... - Nothing.

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,840
All water and ices.

133
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Let me tell you.

134
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,200
I was almost frozen inside there.

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,680
Fine.

136
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,600
Go back first to ease their worries.

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,760
Yes, exactly.

138
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Let's go back.

139
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,960
Let's go.

140
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Go.

141
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,540
The fatal lot is unavoidable.

142
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,000
Uncle, brother.

143
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
You have already known.

144
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,600
Since predecessor Lan Yi broke the taboo,

145
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
Lan clan has forbidden people to enter the back hill.

146
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,040
They afraid the grievance of the Yin Iron may affect the people.

147
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Thus in five clans,

148
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,400
only the Masters of Lan clan know what happened to the Yin Iron

149
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,720
And pass the story to the next generation.

150
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,070
That's why the spirit snatch happened

151
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,440
and the Auqa Demon appeared.

152
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,160
Zewu Jun you've already known that

153
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,640
they may associate with the Yin Iron.

154
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
Childe Wei is so smart,

155
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,200
your conjecture is basically right

156
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,360
when we were at Biling Lake.

157
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,600
Wangji,

158
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
when you came to ask me ,

159
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,320
I was unable to tell the fact.

160
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,560
My confidant.

161
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,760
Now changes have happened.

162
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,360
Uncle thought they may associate with the Yin Iron

163
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,840
and asked me to check the enchantment,

164
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
it was waken indeed.

165
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
This time uncle went to area of Qinghe

166
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,640
to discuss this with Clan Leader Nie

167
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,920
But it didn't come to me

168
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,680
you entered the cave so soon

169
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,680
and I didn't expect the Yin Iron would appear.

170
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,480
It's Wen clan of Qishan again.

171
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,480
Don't chase.

172
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,400
It seems Wen clan of Qishan coming here as auditors

173
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
was for the Yin Iron.

174
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,360
Predecessor Lan Yi once said

175
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,600
shards of the Yin Iron started to activate in recent decade

176
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,520
because the appearance of other pieces.

177
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,800
Our prediction is right.

178
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,140
Wen Ruohan has owned a shard of the Yin Iron already,

179
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
another shard is in Cloud Recesses.

180
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
That's why he sent people to acquire.

181
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,640
How did Wen Ruohan know that

182
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,160
Gusu has one piece?

183
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,310
The Yin Iron represses the whole world,

184
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,280
yet one hundred years passed,

185
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,120
no one knows where it is.

186
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Yet since Wen Ruohan

187
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,840
can get one shard of the Yin Iron,

188
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,800
he must be helped by someone.

189
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,640
Predecessor Lan Yi said

190
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
pieces of the Yin Iron can feel each other.

191
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,520
Since we have one,

192
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,320
why not use it to feel others?

193
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,600
Uncle, brother, what shall we do now?

194
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,240
When the Yin Iron appears,

195
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,440
if some evil guys get it,

196
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,080
disasters will be brought.

197
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,800
Now

198
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,280
we can only seal it and put it back to cold pond,

199
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,680
set the enchantment again and no one can get near to it.

200
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,720
Uncle,

201
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,520
Wen Ruohan has had a shard of the Yin Iron already.

202
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
Shards have associations.

203
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,640
Even if we put it back into the cold pond again,

204
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,960
it won't change anything.

205
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,240
Besides,

206
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,920
Wen Ruohan had a covet for the Yin Iron.

207
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,360
I'm afraid we can't hide it from him.

208
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Let's discuss it later.

209
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Uncle...

210
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't mention it again.

211
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
This

212
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,240
is a secret of gentry houses.

213
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
Master, don't worry.

214
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,270
I won't tell anyone.

215
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,840
Bro Wei.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,160
Bro Wei.

217
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,520
Second Childe Lan.

218
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,440
Bro Wei.

219
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I know you'll come back alive.

220
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
Where did you go?

221
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,120
Why did Zewu Jun come to see you?

222
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Did he beat you again?

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,480
Be assured, I won't be beat again.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
But Cloud Recesses is too large,

225
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,360
the Second Childe Lan almost got lost.

226
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,480
Get lost when go to a cold spring.

227
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
You two had been missing for the whole night.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
Did you experience anything strange?

229
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,880
Anything strange?

230
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,080
There is one.

231
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,280
Do you want to know?

232
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,560
Yes.

233
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,880
Come here.

234
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,040
It was a dark night yesterday with big winds sweeping,

235
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,400
a pair of hand stretched out of the Cold Spring suddenly,

236
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,600
and pulled us down into the pool.

237
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
Guess what was that?

238
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,520
What?

239
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,320
Devil snake.

240
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,000
Stay here.

241
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,160
Do you want to know his look?

242
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,000
D...Don't tell me.  I'm afraid of snakes.

243
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,640
This kind of experience

244
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,760
just keep it to yourself.

245
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,560
I'll just leave.

246
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,880
Don't forget the Lanterns tonight.

247
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,280
Just go.

248
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,120
Jiang Cheng.

249
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,160
Jiang Cheng.

250
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,840
Why you are in such a hurry.

251
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,880
Wei Wuxian.

252
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,760
You are familiar with Lan Wangji now.

253
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,280
Why don't you go to his clan

254
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
and stay at Cloud Recesses?

255
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
Don't come back to Lotus Cove.

256
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,760
What's wrong with you?

257
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,040
It's sure that Lotus Cove is much better.

258
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,200
Only the three thousands families rules

259
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,720
would finish me off.

260
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,880
Don't think too much. Let's go.

261
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,800
Father.

262
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,400
The Yin Iron in Cloud Recesses has appeared.

263
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,680
Congratulations.

264
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Congratulations?

265
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,160
Have you got it?

266
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,280
Xue Yang.

267
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,720
Your excellency.

268
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,640
Go, Yueyang.

269
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
So... the Chang clan of Yueyang?

270
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,560
You can do whatever you want.

271
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,080
I only ask for the Yin Iron.

272
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Thanks, Your Excellency.

273
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,880
Xue Yang, some words, I think I don't have to repeat.

274
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,120
Be assured, Your Excellency.

275
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,120
I'm not interested in the Yin Iron.

276
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,600
What's more,

277
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,840
I'm only a small cultivator,

278
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,280
how can I say no to you.

279
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Father.

280
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
how can you ask the hooligan to Yueyang?

281
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,200
Or I should ask you to go there?

282
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,560
But... father,

283
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,480
what if he has a different thought...

284
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
So you have the mission

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,880
to assist him with some other fellows.

286
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,440
If he does something unusual,

287
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,280
you know what to do.

288
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,640
How about the Yin Iron in Cloud Recesses?

289
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
Will you just let it stay there?

290
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,840
Lan Clan of Gusu is unable to control it.

291
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,130
I'm the one who is behind all this.

292
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,730
But.

293
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,000
Without your permission,

294
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,960
I still got my own method.

295
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,920
No, don't wind in that way, do as I told you,

296
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,600
look at me.

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
It's not stable.

298
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,400
Do like this.

299
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,840
Wrap this first.

300
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,080
You are such a slow learner.

301
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,600
Give me that.

302
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,280
You are so smart.

303
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,320
How did you do that?

304
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,640
Look, mine is beautiful.

305
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,440
At least mine is better than yours.

306
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,640
When we fly kites, it will be much higher.

307
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,320
Yes.

308
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,280
Do it by on your own.

309
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,520
This is nice.

310
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,040
This

311
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,520
is too tight.

312
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,280
Lan Zhan,

313
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,720
shall we set a lantern together to make a wish,

314
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,040
since we have experiences life risks together.

315
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I'm used to being alone.

316
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
You can change your habit anyway.

317
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,040
And my lantern

318
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,920
is especially made for you.

319
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,760
Look.

320
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,840
You smiled.

321
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,860
Bro Wei.

322
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,320
Mine is the best of the best.

323
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,880
I made it with efforts.

324
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,320
How can you just burn it?

325
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,000
Bro Nie, I'll make a new one for you.

326
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,110
This paper was produced in Cheyun Works in Qinghe.

327
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,510
It is as slight as the wings of cicada

328
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,550
as fine as jade

329
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,800
and worth thousands of gold.

330
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,320
You can't afford it.

331
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Look.

332
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,850
Wish I can graduate successfully

333
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,760
and don't come back to here again.

334
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,560
I wish my little brother

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,360
can be safe and sound for his whole life

336
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,800
and no danger in his life.

337
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
I, Wei Wuxian

338
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,960
wish I can always stand with justice, live with no regrets.

339
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,400
Childe.

340
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,400
Senior Sister.

341
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
What wish did you make?

342
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
I wish you can grow up soon and behave well.

343
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,960
You lie to me.

344
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,520
You must have wished to have a good marriage.

345
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,520
Lady Jiang's marriage has be set already.

346
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
She doesn't have to ask for it.

347
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,960
The bridegroom is right there.

348
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,760
How could Lady Jiang put the Lantern alone?

349
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,920
They had just made it together

350
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,440
I heard that Childe Jin and Lady Jiang

351
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,640
will get marry soon.

352
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,850
Why don't you put the lantern together

353
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,960
and make a wish for your life-long happiness?

354
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes, Childe Jin,

355
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,120
Altair meets Lyra once a year.

356
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,040
They will bless your happiness.

357
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,400
Mianmian, it's time to go.

358
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,360
Where are you going? Wei Wuxian.

359
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,680
What happened? Childe.

360
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,480
Why don't we put Lanterns with Lady Jiang?

361
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,040
Now stop asking.

362
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,840
Childe, forgive me.

363
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,840
You have a promised marriage with Lady Jiang,

364
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
you will be laughed by others because you left.

365
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
Childe.

366
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,400
Listen, Mianmian.

367
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
This marriage is not what I want.

368
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,840
Don't say it again.

369
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,920
Wait.

370
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,760
What do you mean"don't say it again"?

371
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,960
Wei Wuxian.

372
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,840
Does it have something to do with you?

373
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,280
Childe Wei.

374
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,280
What do you mean"don't say it again"?

375
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,440
Is that difficult to understand?

376
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,400
Don't say it again.

377
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,440
You.

378
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,880
Lady Jiang, Lady Jiang.

379
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,680
Hurry up.

380
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,520
Childe Wei...Childe Wei...

381
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,680
He was in a fight with our Childe.

382
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,840
I'll beat you to death!

383
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,240
Don't stop me!

384
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,040
Come here.

385
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,000
I'll beat you to death!

386
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,920
Come on!

387
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,220
Wei Wuxian.

388
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,200
Let me go.

389
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,400
- Stop, Wei Ying. - Don't stop me, Lan Zhan.

390
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,920
Let me go.

391
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,120
You're dead!

392
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,120
Let me go.

393
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,600
Excuse me.

394
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,080
Xian.

395
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,280
- Come on! - Xian.

396
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,880
Come here.

397
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,160
Let me go.

398
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,000
Xian.

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Xian.

400
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
I heard that Childe Jin looked down on Lady Jiang,

401
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,200
he want to beak the troth.

402
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,360
Wei Wuxian is defending his senior sister.

403
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Xian.

404
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,960
Let's go home.

405
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,440
Wei Ying.

406
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
Since you know you were wrong, why did you do that.

407
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,680
Lan Zhan.

408
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,080
Look, Lan Zhan .

409
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,120
So many ants, all black.

410
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,840
Look, look.

411
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,910
You were asked to kneel and reflect,

412
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,960
how can you play with ants?

413
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,640
So unteachable.

414
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,920
But these ants are

415
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,520
so cute.

416
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Uncle Jiang, why are you here?

417
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,120
= Jiang Fengmian. Jiang clan of Yunmeng. =

418
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,720
Kneel.
= Jiang Fengmian. Jiang clan of Yunmeng. =

419
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,480
Kneel down so quickly.

420
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,840
I have often been punished, you know that.

421
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,940
But as for Jin Zixuan, this peacock,

422
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,800
he must have not got used to kneeling.

423
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,360
I would change my surname

424
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
if he didn't cry for the long-time kneeling.

425
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
Aren't you shameful to say this?

426
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Father came here for you throughout that night.

427
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,640
Later,

428
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,640
You must be scold by the old Master Lan.

429
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Jin Zixuan, you are sure to die.

430
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,070
= Jin Guangshan from Jin clan of Lanling =

431
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,000
Master Lan.

432
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,360
Brother Jiang.

433
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,400
Two clan leaders must be tired after long journey.

434
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,640
Sit down please.

435
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,520
This happened all sudden.

436
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,480
Although it was just a quarrel between the teenagers,

437
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,320
it relates to the troth between your clans.

438
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,560
I dare not make decision on my own.

439
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,080
The only thing I can do is to ask you two

440
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,640
to have a discussion.

441
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,680
I have know the whole affair.

442
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,720
Wei Ying is a naughty boy

443
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,800
caused many troubles to you.

444
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm responsible for that too.

445
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,520
My apology.

446
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,480
Brother Jiang.

447
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,600
You need not to.

448
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,280
I also know something of the affair.

449
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll go back to scold my son.

450
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,200
Have a fight privately.

451
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,760
I ordered him to kneel according to the family rules.

452
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,760
Two clans leaders don't need to be so.

453
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,880
Yet as for the marriage

454
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,920
should be dealt seriously.

455
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,840
Master Lan is right.

456
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Marriage is serious.

457
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,880
Brother Jin, I have one request for you.

458
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,280
My pleasure.

459
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,520
Please say it, Brother Jiang.

460
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,120
We Jiang clan of Yunmeng

461
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
claim the following of one's nature.

462
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,400
We don't force our children into

463
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
doing something they don't like.

464
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,920
Although these two children have a troth.

465
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,560
It was originally

466
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,920
set by Yanli's mother.

467
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,240
Now since

468
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,120
both of them are not willing to keep it.

469
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,000
Let us cancel it.

470
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,040
Father.

471
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,760
Brother Jiang.

472
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Children are too little to understand it.

473
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,800
It is a misunderstanding.

474
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,240
We can just ignore this.

475
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,840
Brother Jin.

476
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,400
We can set the troth for them

477
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,080
but we can't marry for them.

478
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,440
After all, it's the two children who are going to

479
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,680
spend the rest of their life together.

480
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,240
I had sent a letter to Yanli's mother.

481
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,850
Let's cancel the troth.

482
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,360
Brother Jiang.

483
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,760
It's my son's fault.

484
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,380
He ruined such a beautiful union.

485
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Since you have made up your mind,

486
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,520
I'll follow your decision.

487
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,880
But this

488
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,400
should not affect the relationship between our two clans.

489
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,040
How could it happen.

490
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,120
Wei Wuxian! Something terrible happens!

491
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,480
My sister is going to break her troth with Jin Zixuan.

492
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,040
What?

493
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,640
He wants to be beaten one more time?

494
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,680
How dare he!

495
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,400
No, It's my father who brought it up.

496
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Uncle Jiang?

497
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,560
Where is my senior sister?

498
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,790
Inside the room.

499
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,800
Childe Lan.

500
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,560
Clan Leader Jiang.

501
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
Clan Leader Jiang, to be honest,

502
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,440
this time I invited you

503
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,640
is for another issue.

504
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Please say it.

505
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,960
Forgive me,

506
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,710
because it is so essential,

507
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,200
I have to be careful.

508
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,160
Have you heard

509
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,220
something strange happened recently?

510
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,880
I have heard some.

511
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,720
The cultivators' spirits were snatched.

512
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,440
It happened in our place too.

513
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,720
What's the cause?

514
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,240
I'd like to hear.

515
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,920
These were

516
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,680
because a treasure made one hundred years ago

517
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,040
reappeared in the world.

518
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,320
What?

519
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,480
The Yin Iron.

520
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,800
Xian.

521
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,680
I know it's you.

522
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,280
Xian.

523
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,120
Senior Sister, I...

524
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,200
Are you okay after kneeling for so long?

525
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,320
How is your knees. Let me check it.

526
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,120
Senior Sister.

527
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,360
It's my fault.

528
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,280
You can scold me.

529
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,280
I might feel better.

530
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Xian.

531
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,630
This has nothing to do with you.

532
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,190
Don't think too much.

533
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,960
As for my destiny,

534
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,190
it's not up to me.

535
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,360
Senior Sister.

536
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,120
You will marry

537
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,880
someone much much better than him.

538
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,880
You will have

539
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,280
a beautiful lady to marry you.

540
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
No, I don't want it.

541
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,880
I just want to stay with my senior sister. in Lotus Cove.

542
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,150
Xian.

543
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,960
Our Visit ends soon.

544
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,150
We'll go back in one day or two.

545
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,840
This soon?

546
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,010
Didn't you have enough fun?

547
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,960
Dad said,

548
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,160
we'll leave when Cheng is back.

549
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,160
We'll say farewell to Master Lan.

550
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,800
I didn't see reasons behind these.

551
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,680
To be honest, Clan Leader Jiang.

552
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,560
What worries us most

553
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,700
is the piece appeared at the beginning.

554
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,240
If it was used by someone who has some vicious purpose

555
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,400
disasters will happen again,

556
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,280
which will bring endless consequences.

557
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,560
Wen Clan of Qishan

558
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,960
is shrouded by grey clouds.

559
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,000
Hence,

560
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,040
I heard something strange.

561
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,240
Recently in Yueyang,

562
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,680
several small clans were slaughtered.

563
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
No one survived.

564
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,480
I don't know who did this.

565
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,120
Yet the murder

566
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,040
is a young guest of Wen clan.

567
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,440
How could this happen.

568
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,360
Wen has revealed his ambition.

569
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,840
We have to hurry up.

570
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,640
Come in.

571
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,240
Disciple here to bid farewell to Master Lan and Clan Leader Lan.

572
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,440
One will be awarded for merits and punished for faults.

573
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,880
Childe Wei

574
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,240
You have been punished

575
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,760
for your fault in Cloud Recesses.

576
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,000
As for merits,

577
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,000
Clan Leader Jiang must have his awards.

578
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,440
What merits does he have?

579
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,440
Clan Leader Jiang,

580
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,320
You should regulate Wei Ying more strictly.

581
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,320
Before his coming

582
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,520
these youngsters dared do nothing.

583
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,320
Yet since he came

584
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,280
these cowards

585
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
are encouraged to

586
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,160
flee out at night and drink wines secretly.

587
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
He is always like this

588
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,740
Thanks for Master Lan's discipline.

589
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,680
Come in.

590
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,720
Wangji, what happens?

591
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,520
Clan Leader Lan.

592
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,040
I'll take leave.

593
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,240
Clan Leader Jiang.

594
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,600
Be assured.

595
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,320
I know the importance.

596
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
If you give order,

597
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,800
our clan will do our utmost.

598
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,800
Childe Lan.

599
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,320
Master Lan.

600
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
Second Childe Lan.

601
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
I'll leave now.

602
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
Take care.

603
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,600
OK.

604
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,280
Lan Zhan, as for the Yin Iron.

605
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,760
Lan Zhan.

606
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,800
Follow up.

607
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,280
Wangji.

608
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Take care of yourself.

609
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Wei Wuxian, are your silly?

610
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
He dislike you so much.

611
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,800
Why are you so close to him?

612
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,760
Why?

613
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,520
After spending half year together, can't I say a goodbye?

614
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,000
I want to hit you.

615
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,320
He must be happy

616
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,760
to hear you'll leave.

617
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,680
Bullshit.

618
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,800
I tell you

619
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,640
these disciples here all like me very much.

620
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,400
No one wants me to leave.

621
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,720
Senior Sister,

622
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,800
am I right?

623
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,440
Yes.

624
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,080
Our Xian is everyone's favorite.

625
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,400
Let me ask you,

626
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,760
why you only say farewell to Lan Zhan

627
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,400
among so many disciples?

628
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,430
Can't I admire his talents?

629
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,320
You are all losers to me.

630
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,000
I desire for a equivalence.

631
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,480
He is my match.

632
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,120
It is not easy.

633
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Aren't you shameful?

634
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,160
Who should be shameful, the one who fights first.

635
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,040
Exactly I refers to you.

636
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,240
Come one you two.

637
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,240
Fighting is forbidden here, behave well.

638
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,560
Play at Lotus Cove.

639
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,120
Yes, Senior Sister.  I know, Senior Sister.

640
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,240
I won't hit him.

641
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,240
Wei Wuxian, you...

642
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,040
Stop!

643
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,400
Stop!

644
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,920
How can you hit me?

645
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,720
You two, stop it.

646
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,280
Senior Sister, look at him.

647
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,240
Fine, stop now.

648
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,680
Stop.

649
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,320
Noise is forbidden here.

650
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,320
Jiang Cheng. What are you doing?

651
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,720
Sis, look at him.

652
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,920
After his leave

653
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,800
here will be as quiet as before.

654
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,360
Wangji.

655
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,640
Should you tell Childe Wei

656
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,520
you're leaving for the Yin Iron?

657
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,520
No.

658
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,720
Little rabbit, little rabbit.

659
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,680
Pets are not allowed in Cloud Recesses.

660
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,520
Thus I can only hide you here.

661
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,200
Are you happy living here?

662
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,520
Happy.

663
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,160
OK.

664
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm content to hear that.

665
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,200
Little rabbits,

666
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,600
I should take you back to Lotus Cove?

667
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,240
No, no, no.

668
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,480
If Lan Zhan feels lonely one day and come here,

669
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,960
he can't find you then.

670
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,720
However...

671
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,320
Take care, Wangji.

672
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,840
Little rabbits,

673
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,200
where will he go by himself?

674
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,070
Can't he go to find the Yin Iron alone, can he?
