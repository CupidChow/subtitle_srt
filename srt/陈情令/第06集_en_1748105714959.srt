00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000

The fifth one is the first one.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fifth 7 is as shall be all run

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to finish the second pattern.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The final is the first one.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,120
Episode 13

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,520
How did you get these?

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
I got some peanuts.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,040
Ok.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
protection.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
Here.

39
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,880
That's really good.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Of course.

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,880
In Gusu, you must drink the Tianzi Xiang.

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
The smell is good.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
You can get into the mouth easily.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
You can't get into the mouth easily.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
You can't get into the mouth easily.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Drink as much as you want.

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
You're talking like a human being.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Brother Jiang, I think

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,880
Brother Wei is talking very well.

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,880
The so-called pure wine is better than beauty.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,880
You're right.

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Come on.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,880
You just smell the wine.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
You can get into the mouth easily.

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
If there's wine, then it's okay.

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,880
How can you be so popular in Gusu?

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
What's wrong with me?

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
No one can be popular

59
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
like you.

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Wei Jing, what's the standard?

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Wei Wuxian, you dare to say

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
that the beauty is born to be a beauty.

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
You...

64
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Wei Wuxian.

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
You're gentle and virtuous.

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Please be honest.

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Wei Wuxian.

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
And you're honest.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Say it again.

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
You can't talk too much.

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Wei Wuxian.

72
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Don't run.

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
You can't run.

74
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Wei Wuxian.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
And you can't be too fierce.

76
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,880
And you can't be too cruel.

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
I'll let you say it.

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Wei Wuxian.

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Brother Jiang, get up.

80
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
What are you doing?

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
They say that it's early.

82
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
It's better than early.

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Since Brother Wangji is here,

84
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
why don't we sit down

85
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
and have a drink?

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Let's have a chat.

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
We're not familiar with the place.

88
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Let's go in.

89
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Lan Zhan, don't be so stubborn.

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Today, everyone has made a promise.

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
And the water is clear.

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
And the water is clear.

93
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Please be careful.

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
You guys,

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
please get to the hotel.

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
What's that?

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
What's that?

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
What's that?

99
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Lan Zhan, look.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
They're drunk.

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
They can't walk.

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
How about this?

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
You'd better sit down with me.

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Let's have a drink.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Let's have a chat.

106
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Lan Zhan.

107
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
You guys don't go.

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
I'll ask someone to come.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Lan Zhan.

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Lan Zhan.

111
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Lan Zhan.

112
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Lan Zhan.

113
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Come here.

114
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Sit down.

115
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Have a drink.

116
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
I didn't lie to you.

117
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
It's good, right?

118
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Lan Zhan.

119
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Lan Zhan.

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Why are you so thick?

121
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
You're so thick that you can't even tell the red.

122
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Lan Zhan.

123
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Lan Zhan.

124
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Can you go back to your bedroom?

125
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Don't sleep here.

126
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I didn't expect that

127
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
the Lan Er who was on the top of the high school

128
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
would be in my hands.

129
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Lan Er.

130
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
It's Wei.

131
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Wei.

132
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
What's the matter?

133
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
You're here to reflect on this?

134
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
You're not hungry anymore?

135
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm hungry.

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Let me help you.

137
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Go away.

138
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
It's broken.

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
It's broken again.

140
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
What are you doing?

141
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm just helping you adjust the ink.

142
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Why are you so nervous?

143
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
ink is an important thing.

144
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
It's not my parents' fault.

145
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
How can I touch it?

146
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
My wife.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
What are you laughing at?

148
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
I'm laughing at you guys.

149
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
There are rules and rules.

150
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Which woman can marry?

151
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
You're a man.

152
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Yu Hao.

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
I think

154
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,880
is everyone in your family so boring?

155
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Your father is as boring as you.

156
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Isn't it boring to be with your mother?

157
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I don't have a mother.

158
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
I don't have a mother.

159
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't have a mother.

160
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
How can you not have a mother?

161
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
You jumped out of the stone hole.

162
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
When I was four,

163
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
my parents said

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
as they said,

165
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
it was also the time of the ceremony.

166
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
But now I remember

167
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
the scene where the wild dogs chased me.

168
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
I can't remember

169
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
what my parents looked like.

170
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
I only remember one scene.

171
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
My mother

172
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
supported me on the donkey.

173
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I walked in front of her.

174
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
She seemed to be laughing.

175
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Then my father laughed.

176
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
When she encountered my mother,

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Festival of Chronicles came so fast!

178
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Lan Zhan.

179
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Come, I'll give you this.

180
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
No.

181
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
No, I want Naive的话.

182
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
It's the same as the same thing.

183
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
It's the same as the same thing.

184
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,540
Come

185
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Let's drink.

186
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,920
that would be the most powerful way to cut its flesh

187
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,420
that would be called for.

188
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,340
Mr. Lian R Columbia, how about you?

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,200
It wasn't like we could decide

190
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,020
if we will come to see Mr. Niemikow.

191
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,220
The Qing River also had a similar situation.

192
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
red scars.

193
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,380
Did they find any clues?

194
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,740
Chief Ye is investigating.

195
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,060
Is there anything wrong with the cloud god?

196
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,060
It's a good thing that the people in Wen clan are safe.

197
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,700
But there is a flood in Biling Lake.

198
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,140
Tell me more.

199
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,020
I want to tell you something.

200
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,540
A few days ago, I took some disciples

201
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,820
to the Biling Lake to get rid of the flood.

202
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,980
The water吔

203
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,460
クル叨牙 photo was printed and formed into theоном Oryxon 잘못um.

204
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,180
I've never been stressed.

205
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,980
enciae Wei acted scared.

206
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,700
The worry caused by this might have something to do with the portrait.

207
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,140
paw?

208
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,580
Wei Wuxian

209
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,780
is the eldest disciple of Chief Jiang.

210
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,140
This Wei Wuxian is a dirty person.

211
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,140
He is the son of Wei Changze and a dirty person.

212
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,300
No wonder Wei Wuxian has so many precious eyes.

213
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,660
He is just like his mother.

214
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Report.

215
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,500
Mr. Lan.

216
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,220
Zewu Jun.

217
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,500
What is it?

218
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,260
Wei Wuxian took some students to drink.

219
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,060
He was caught.

220
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,100
Mr. Lan is also in it.

221
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,500
Wang Ji is also in it.

222
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,100
How dare you!

223
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Mr. Wang Ji is wrong.

224
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Please forgive him.

225
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
He is a criminal.

226
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Mr. Zewu Jun.

227
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
We did offend Mr. Lan.

228
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
But Lan Zhan...

229
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Nonsense!

230
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Wei Wuxian.

231
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Your ban is not closed yet.

232
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Please make trouble again.

233
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
You want to make the cloud body unbearable.

234
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
What are you trying to do?

235
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
You are so stupid.

236
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
You are so stupid.

237
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
You are so stupid.

238
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
You are so stupid.

239
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Don't think you are a dirty person.

240
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Sir.

241
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Do you know my mother?

242
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Sir.

243
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Shut up.

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Wang Ji.

245
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Mr. Wei is a loyal person.

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
But you know the fault.

247
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
I know the fault.

248
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Zewu Jun.

249
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Zewu Jun.

250
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
It's me.

251
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I pulled Lan Zhan in.

252
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
He didn't blame himself.

253
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Wang Ji is wrong.

254
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
He is a criminal.

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Why do you find yourself a criminal?

256
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Wei Wuxian.

257
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
He has been punished 300 times.

258
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Lan Zhan is not in the same punishment as Wei Wuxian.

259
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Other loyal people.

260
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
50 times a day.

261
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
He has been punished 300 times.

262
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
300 times?

263
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Such a long sentence.

264
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
I will die in the dream.

265
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Beat him.

266
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Beat him.

267
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Cheng.

268
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
You have been strict with Xian.

269
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Why did you come back together last night?

270
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Sister.

271
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Don't mention it.

272
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Don't tell my parents.

273
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I have been strict with 50 times.

274
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Then I have been strict with 300 times.

275
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Don't mention it.

276
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
You are a woman.

277
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
No one forced you to drink.

278
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
You two, do you want to fight?

279
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Sister.

280
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I am hurt everywhere.

281
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
This is a lesson for you.

282
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
You wait.

283
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I will cook you some soup.

284
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Sister.

285
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I am sick.

286
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I need more meat.

287
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
If you have the same meal,

288
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
it will be better.

289
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
You two.

290
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Zou Wujun.

291
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Zou Wujun.

292
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Zou Wujun.

293
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I am a member of the family.

294
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You two went too far yesterday.

295
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
But I am also angry.

296
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You are also severely punished.

297
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It is important to remember that

298
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
your back injury

299
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
may not be recovered in half a month.

300
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
If my injury can be recovered in half a month,

301
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I will be cured.

302
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I will treat you to a place to heal your wound.

303
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
You will recover faster.

304
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
It will prevent the effect of learning.

305
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Thank you for your care.

306
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Zou Wujun.

307
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
My mother...

308
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Childe Wei.

309
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
The person who was injured

310
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
was my uncle's friend.

311
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
My uncle was seriously injured.

312
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
But the word he said

313
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
was the same as your father's.

314
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
So, Childe Wei.

315
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Don't be so happy.

316
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I am willing to do something for you.

317
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I am really...

318
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
The beard you had

319
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
was really different.

320
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Bi Linghu.

321
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Water Star Garden.

322
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Bai Tong County.

323
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
So it is.

324
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
So it is.

325
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
The silver iron is in the water.

326
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Lan Zhan.

327
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Lan Zhan.

328
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Lan Zhan.

329
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Lan Zhan.

330
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Lan Zhan.

331
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Lan Zhan.

332
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
This is a good place.

333
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Why don't you tell me?

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
It's so boring.

335
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
How did you get in?

336
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Zou Wujun asked me to come in.

337
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
It's so cold.

338
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It's so cold.

339
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
It's so cold.

340
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
So cold.

341
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
So cold.

342
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Don't be so confused.

343
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I know.

344
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
But the water is too cold.

345
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
If I don't get in,

346
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I will die of blood and tears.

347
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Lan Zhan.

348
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Lan Zhan.

349
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
You are so mean.

350
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Although you are a little old-fashioned,

351
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
and you are a little boring,

352
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
I am not good at you at first.

353
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
But after we fought,

354
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
we got a fight.

355
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Wei Wuxian

356
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
is very close to me.

357
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
He wants to be friends with you.

358
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
No need.

359
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
That's not interesting.

360
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
I tell you,

361
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
there are many good places

362
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
to be friends with me.

363
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
What are you doing?

364
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Taking off clothes and getting injured.

365
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Don't go.

366
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I can't take it off.

367
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Lan Zhan,

368
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
have you been to Yunmeng?

369
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Yunmeng is fun.

370
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
There are many good food in Yunmeng.

371
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
How about this?

372
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
If you go to Lianhuawu,

373
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I will pick up...

374
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I will pick up Lianmeng for you.

375
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
And Lingqiao.

376
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Okay?

377
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
No.

378
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Okay,

379
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I will tell you a big secret.

380
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Yunmeng has many beautiful girls.

381
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Lan Zhan,

382
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
do you feel any difference?

383
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Lan Zhan.

384
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Lan Zhan,

385
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
what is this place?

386
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Why is there a whirlpool under the cold spring?

387
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
What is this place?

388
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
It's so strange.

389
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
It's cold.

390
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
It's not over yet.

391
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I can't take it off.

392
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
I can't take it off.

393
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I can't take it off.

394
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
I can't take it off.

395
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I can't take it off.

396
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I can't take it off.

397
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Lan Zhan.

398
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Lan Zhan.

399
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Wait for me.

400
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
What is this place?

401
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Xiansha tree.

402
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Xiansha tree?

403
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Isn't this your Lan family's family heirloom?

404
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
What is this place?

405
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
It's a place where you can't take it off.

406
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
What is this place?

407
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Why are you all asking me to come?

408
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Xiansha has Lan family's heirloom.

409
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
If she doesn't attack me,

410
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
I think she will be the one who dares to take the Lan family's heirloom.

411
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Why is there a blue-eyed moth on this rabbit's head?

412
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
I heard that all the blue-eyed children

413
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
must be accompanied by a moth.

414
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
The moth is the master and the law.

415
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Why is there a moth on the rabbit's head?

416
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
A moth?

417
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Moth?

418
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Lan Zhan.

419
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Moth.

420
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I'll kill you.

421
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Lan Zhan.

422
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Lan Zhan.

423
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Lan Zhan.

424
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Give me your moth.

425
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Hurry up.

426
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I want to know what kind of treasure this is.

427
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
You don't want to be a stranger.

428
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Don't talk.

429
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
This heart...

430
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
is yours.

431
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
It's yours?

432
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I don't know.

433
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I don't know.

434
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
I don't know.

435
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
You don't know?

436
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
I don't know.

437
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
It's mine.

438
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
It's yours?

439
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
It's not much.

440
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
It's more powerful.

441
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
It's the one who killed the people who attacked the foreign land.

442
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,500
I think it's the moth that I lost.

443
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
I'll see.

444
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I won't move.

445
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Take it.

446
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
The moth is not so light.

447
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
How can I look at you if it's not taken?

448
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I have my own way.

449
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
I'll take it.

450
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Wuling?

451
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I've heard that you have a family of two

452
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
who can communicate with the immortals through playing the piano.

453
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
You can communicate with the immortals?

454
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Wuling?

455
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I've heard that you have a family of two

456
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
who can communicate with the immortals through playing the piano.

457
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
It's him.

458
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Do you know who it is?

459
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
What happened?

460
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,700
The Motheno is still nearby.

461
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Dismissed.

462
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
It's him again?

463
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Right.

464
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
He's dead.

465
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Right.

466
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,240
Be careful of the AB裡

467
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,260
There is a Japanese

468
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:28,580
It seems it is a

469
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,700
It's not like I can't

470
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I'll be back.

471
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Uncle.

472
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I don't think we have any plan

473
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
for Wangji and Childe Wei.

474
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
I've sent someone to look for them.

475
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Wangji is innocent.

476
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
He will never be as confused as Wei Ying.

477
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Now they are missing.

478
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm afraid that he will be fine.

479
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
I'm just worried.

480
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
It's raining.

481
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Childe Wei!

482
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Childe Wei!

483
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Childe Wei!

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Childe Wei!

485
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Childe Wei!

486
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Childe Wei!

487
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Sister.

488
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Sister.

489
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
You rest here.

490
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll take someone to look for them.

491
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Cheng.

492
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Do you have to find them?

493
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Don't worry, sister.

494
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
I'll find them.

495
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
I'll break his legs.

496
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Miss Jiang.

497
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Be careful.

498
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Gu Sulan is the only female master of the Gu Sulan clan.

499
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,500
She is the only female master of the Gu Sulan clan.

500
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
She is the one who created the letter of the immortal.

501
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Lan Ye?

502
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Senior Wei Ying, the descendant of the Jiang clan,

503
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
greets the master.

504
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Senior Wei Ying,

505
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
the little rabbit that you brought from the desert

506
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
is your feed?

507
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I raised this rabbit in the Handan Cave.

508
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
I have been weak these years.

509
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
They often run out after they finish their food.

510
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Senior Wei Ying,

511
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
you have been in the Passage for many years.

512
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Why?

513
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm afraid that I will be in trouble.

514
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm afraid that I will be in trouble.

515
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
It must be related to the Yin Iron.

516
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,500
This is the biggest mistake I have ever made.

517
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
And I have paid the price of the Yin Iron

518
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,500
with the power of the immortal.

519
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Senior Wei Ying,

520
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
what is the Yin Iron?

521
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,500
And where did the other people from the Handan Cave come from?

522
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
The Fengjing Gate is now in a very deep state.

523
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
My spirit is getting weaker and weaker.

524
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
You are here again.

525
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
You are here again.

526
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
You are here again.

527
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
You are here again.

528
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
You are here again.

529
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
You are here again.

530
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Is this the Heaven's will?

531
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Senior Wei Ying.

532
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Several hundred years ago,

533
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,500
this Yin Iron was not a random one.

534
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
The Yin Iron was once a mountain.

535
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
And the blood of the dragon was also the highest state in the France.

536
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
The hundred years of history are not reliable.

537
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
No one knows

538
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,500
of the blood and the blood of theawning righteous cows.

539
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Why did they use the Yin Iron to take with them

540
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
to sacrifice their life?

541
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,500
He controlled the rest of the tournaments

542
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
like when he was young.

543
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I can't accept it.

544
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
So the five great families

545
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,500
combined and killed Xue Chonghai.

546
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Childe Wei, you're so smart.

547
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I was on the way to kill Xue Chonghai

548
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
and I was in a hurry to kill the enemy.

549
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
And Yiling was kind and

550
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
turned into a mess.

551
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Senior, what happened to Yin Iron?

552
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Yin Iron caused too many living souls to die.

553
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
It's hard to believe.

554
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Sheling?

555
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Yes.

556
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Yin Iron was born to be safe.

557
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
But it was a world-class thing.

558
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Later, Xue Chonghai was killed by living souls.

559
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
He killed the living souls and even the spirit.

560
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
This is Yin Iron's wishful thinking.

561
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
So it's impossible to say no more.

562
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Call me Yin Iron.

563
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Wenmao, your subordinates will be like me.

564
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Yin Iron.

565
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Later, the five great families decided to suppress Yin Iron

566
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
and cut off the broken city.

567
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
As for the place where the four spirit-souls were worshiped,

568
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
to prevent the reconstruction of the temple,

569
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
the five great families agreed

570
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,500
and never mentioned Yin Iron to the descendants.

571
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Senior, you're so insensitive.

572
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
If Yin Iron really can absorb the energy of the world,

573
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
if our family can't use it,

574
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
it might not be possible to win.

575
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
I didn't expect that

576
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
what you said and what I thought

577
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
would be like a stone.

578
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
As a woman,

579
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
I have been a member of the Lan family

580
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
and I have been keeping my word.

581
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,500
I have been a member of the Lan family for many years.

582
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I tried to break the rules

583
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
and try to create new ones.

584
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,500
For the rest of my life, I have been a member of the Lan family

585
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
but I have been in a mess.

586
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Later, I became friends with the people of Baoshan.

587
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
I was jealous of the city.

588
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Sometimes I heard him mention Yin Iron.

589
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Baoshan?

590
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Senior, you and Baoshan are close.

591
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Baoshan is the only one

592
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I know in my life.

593
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
But I...

594
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
I have lost him.

595
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
What do you mean?

596
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
After I got the Yin Iron,

597
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
I was not able to make up for it.

598
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I was in the Lan family for hundreds of years.

599
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Finally,

600
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
the paper I left from the previous person

601
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
was removed and the Lan family

602
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
took the Yin Iron to the hidden place.

603
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
The cold and cold of the world was gone.

604
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,500
The cold and cold of the world was gone.

605
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,500
The cold and cold of the world was gone.

606
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Not only the cold and cold of the world,

607
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,500
but also the place where the Yin Iron was sealed.

608
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
So, you found the Yin Iron here,

609
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
but you couldn't cross it.

610
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Why did you find it?

611
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
I wanted to be like you.

612
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I was young and handsome.

613
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
How could I hear what others said?

614
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
I was afraid that I would be betrayed by the people.

615
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Baoshan was so proud of me.

616
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
I was so proud of him.

617
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,500
But my life was always in my hands.

618
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I was always in a hurry.

619
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,500
I was only thinking about the Yin Iron.

620
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I was so proud of him.

621
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I didn't know his power

622
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
would come to this place.

623
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
I didn't know

624
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
that I was wrong.

625
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Do you know what will happen next?

626
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Lanying, do you know what will happen to you?

627
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
I didn't come out of the prison.

628
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I came here for Lanshi.

629
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Why did you stop me?

630
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
The Yin Iron is dangerous.

631
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
The people can't evolve.

632
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Have you ever thought that

633
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
if you open the seal, you can't control it?

634
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Then...

635
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
As the family leader of Lanshi,

636
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
I was a suspect.

637
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
When the people can't do it,

638
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
it doesn't mean that I can't do it.

639
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,500
You know what I said.

640
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I can't control the Yin Iron.

641
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
I can't control them.

642
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
I even broke the fire.

643
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Once the seal is removed,

644
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
the Yin Iron can't be sealed.

645
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I lost countless times.

646
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
I didn't succeed.

647
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
I even got hurt.

648
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
I was hurt.

649
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I was hurt.

650
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
I'm sorry.

652
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
The Yin Iron was sealed by me.

653
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
But I can't leave here.

654
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I can't leave here.

655
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
I can't leave here.

656
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
I can't leave here.

657
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I can't leave here.

658
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I can't leave here.

659
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I can't leave here.

660
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
I can't leave here.

661
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
I can't leave here.

662
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,500
I can't leave here.

663
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
I can't leave here.

664
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
I can't leave here.

665
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
I can't leave here.

666
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I can't leave here.

667
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I can't leave here.

668
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
I can't leave here.

669
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
I can't leave here.

670
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I really want to leave here.

671
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
I really want to leave here.

672
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I really want to leave here.

673
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
I can't leave here.

674
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
I can't leave here.

675
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,500
The world is full of grace

676
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,500
The world is full of joy and sorrow

677
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
The young people are so young

678
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Why do you still want to go?

679
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,500
Why don't you wait and wait and wait

680
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
The wind and waves are so strong

681
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,500
The world is full of grace

682
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,500
The world is full of grace
