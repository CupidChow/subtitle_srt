00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 30

3
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,560
Turnips!

4
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Turnips!

5
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,800
Fresh turnips!

6
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Turnips!

7
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,240
Wen Ning,

8
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
can you have some passion

9
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,480
when you are selling turnips?

10
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Your peddling way makes

11
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,960
our turnips seem bad to taste.

12
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
How can you sell them out in this way?

13
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Turnips! Turnips!

14
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
Fresh and delicious turnips!

15
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
Turnips!

16
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,600
Fresh and delicious turnips!

17
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,520
Fresh! Delicious!

18
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,800
Turnips!

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Friends!

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
- Turnips. - Have a look!

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,000
Yiling Patriarch is selling spiritual tools in person!

22
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,960
And talismans for home or traveling use.

23
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
- For home... - I want this one.

24
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,360
Childe, you have a good taste!

25
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,280
This is the Patriarchal Compass I just made.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,120
It's more accurate and durable comparing with the other in the market.

27
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
I want to change it with turnips.

28
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,240
No cash?

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,440
Go away! Away!

30
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Out of my way to save the world.

31
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,480
Come, have a look here!

32
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,040
Talisman tools made by Yiling Patriarch.

33
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,360
Talismans for home and traveling use.

34
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,720
All friends passing here have a look. Don't miss it.

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,640
Come, have a look.

36
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
Sorry.

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
You dirty turnip seller!

38
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,760
Let him stay outside.

39
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Senior sister,

40
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
why you are...

41
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,800
Why else do you think?

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
You think she'll marry you?

43
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
Shut up!

44
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Xian,

45
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,200
I...

46
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm going to get married.

47
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,840
I want to show you my wedding dress.

48
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,880
I know it.

49
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
I heard it already.

50
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,600
From who?

51
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,800
None of your business.

52
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,400
Yet,

53
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,440
I come here alone.

54
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,800
You can't see the groom today.

55
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't want to see him at all.

56
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Beautiful!

57
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
Sister, I've told you that.

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
It's truly beautiful.

59
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,120
The words from you two don't count.

60
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,800
What you said,

61
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
can't be taken for truth.

62
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,440
You neither trust my nor his words.

63
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
So you only will believe it

64
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,520
if that guy say it?

65
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,800
Why keep standing here.

66
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
Let's sit down.

67
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,080
Xian.

68
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,480
Think about a courtesy name.

69
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,800
For whom?

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
My coming nephew.

71
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,880
OK.

72
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
The next generation of Jin clan is "Ru" generation.

73
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,800
Let's call him Jin Rulan.

74
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Jin Rulan.

75
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,080
Nice.

76
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Not good enough.

77
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
Jin Rulan.

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,360
Sounds like the "Lan" of Lan clan.

79
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Why should an offspring of Jiang clan and Jin clan

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
be called "Rulan" ?

81
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,960
It's not that bad from Lan clan, OK?

82
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,920
Lan means orchid, gentry among flowers.

83
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,960
Isn't it great?

84
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,800
It's me who is naming the baby, not you.

85
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,120
Why you keep sighing?

86
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
There, there.

87
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,680
You know the personality of Cheng.

88
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,400
It's he who advised me to ask you

89
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,880
to give the courtesy name of the baby.

90
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Enough, you two stop bickering.

91
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,720
I brought soup for you.

92
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,240
Delicious!

93
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,120
Senior sister.

94
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Sister.

95
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
You also brought his share?

96
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,280
I've brought enough soup anyway.

97
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,760
All present shall have a taste.

98
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,680
I'm sorry

99
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,920
there is the only small bowl left.

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,520
This is for you.

101
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,640
You even brought my share!

102
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
Thank you, Lady Jiang!

103
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,320
This is a flavor of our Yunmeng.

104
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
Can you get used to it?

105
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,960
Yes, sure.

106
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
I want to bring it back

107
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,600
for Yuan.

108
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,800
Did Xian lead a happy life

109
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,880
in that place?

110
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,320
To Yiling Patriarch.

111
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
Would you please shut up?

112
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
How's your wound?

113
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,160
Healed.

114
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,400
How long?

115
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,080
Seven days.

116
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,320
You know me.

117
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,240
This little wound means nothing to me.

118
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,120
But

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
how could you stab me for real?

120
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,040
It's you who broke my arm first.

121
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,200
You healed in seven days.

122
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,360
My arm,

123
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
was with the plaster for over a month.

124
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,760
How can it convince them if we didn't make it look real?

125
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
Besides I broke your left arm.

126
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,640
You can write as usual.

127
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,360
Usually three months for injuring bones.

128
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,160
One month is not that long.

129
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,240
So you'll keep living in this way?

130
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,840
Do you have any plan?

131
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,760
Let it be so.

132
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,720
The fellows dare not leave the mountain.

133
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,840
People keep away from me when I come to town.

134
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,680
It'll be fine

135
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,320
if we don't cause any trouble actively.

136
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,880
Actively?

137
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,240
Believe it or not? Wei Wuxian.

138
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,920
Even if you don't cause any trouble,

139
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,760
trouble will follow you.

140
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,120
It's usually no way to save a person

141
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
yet there are more than

142
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,760
many ways to beset a man.

143
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,800
Capability will beat all machinations.

144
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,920
No matter what methods they take,

145
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,320
I will kill who dare come at us.

146
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,440
You never listen to any of my advice.

147
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,520
One day you will understand

148
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,560
what I said is right.

149
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,680
Can you finish it?

150
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,440
Wei Wuxian,

151
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,440
think it over.

152
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
If you return to them this time,

153
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,800
you may not be able to

154
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,400
see us, your close companions

155
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,560
for a very long while.

156
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,000
But the people I'm returning to

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,880
are also my close companions.

158
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,960
Xian.

159
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,840
This is what I later found

160
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,520
in father's study at home.

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
It should be prepared for you.

162
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,160
Take it.

163
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,760
We won't see you off.

164
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,040
It's troublesome if we're seen.

165
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,600
Let's go.

166
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,880
Xian.

167
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Wen Ning,

168
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,880
why are you still holding the soup?

169
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,320
For Yuan.

170
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,600
Whatever you like.

171
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hold it steady then.

172
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Don't tell your sister

173
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,320
what happened today.

174
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,240
Understand?

175
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,840
Go.

176
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,240
Why you all look at me?

177
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,480
Eat.

178
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,480
Eat!

179
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,520
Why you don't drink the soup?

180
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll drink.

181
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
Tell you what.

182
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
When I went to the town today

183
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,880
I once again met a man

184
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,040
who claimed he was a disciple of Yiling Patriarch.

185
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,720
His talismans

186
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,400
are so ugly.

187
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,200
I knew they are fake when I glanced at it.

188
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,960
Wei Wuxian,

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
what happened?

190
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,840
Why?

191
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,320
I'm just tired of the turnips, that's all.

192
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,640
No appetite.

193
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,920
It's true.

194
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,320
I decide that

195
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,000
I can't always keep designing the talismans.

196
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I want to

197
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,040
invent new dishes for you.

198
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,800
For starters,

199
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,040
grow some lotus.

200
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Grow some lotus?

201
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,560
You're daydreaming again.

202
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
As for the soil here in Burial Mounds,

203
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,440
even potatoes can't grow well,

204
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,160
let alone the roots of lotus.

205
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm the Yiling Patriarch, who are capable

206
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,960
of accomplishing any tasks.

207
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,040
Who said that roots of lotus can't be grown here in Burial Mounds.

208
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
I will accomplish it to astonish you two.

209
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,760
Come, have this.

210
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,720
I really can do that.

211
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,560
What's this?

212
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,600
The soup of roots of lotus.

213
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,760
Roots of lotus? What's it?

214
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
The roots of lotus are...

215
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,800
Do you want to have a taste?

216
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes.

217
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,240
Here you are.

218
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,000
- How's it? - Delicious.

219
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
One more spoon.

220
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,360
Fine.

221
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,920
Here.

222
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,920
Be careful.

223
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,600
Swallow after you chew the roots of lotus up.

224
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,440
Delicious.

225
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,160
One more spoon.

226
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,840
Fine.

227
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,480
More.

228
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,640
The soup of roots of lotus.

229
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,360
Where did you get it?

230
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,440
Sister, this...

231
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
I...

232
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,360
Wen Ning,

233
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
you keep something from me.

234
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Clan Leader Jiang and Lady Jiang were here today.

235
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,760
When you become the clan leader in the future,

236
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,840
I'll be your subordinate.

237
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,840
Just like your father and my father.

238
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,880
There are Jade Twin in Gusu.

239
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,520
Then we have Pride twin in Yunmeng.

240
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
Don't drag me down!

241
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,000
When did I drag you down?

242
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,030
I wish I, Wei Wuxian

243
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,640
could eliminate the evil and help the poor for my life,

244
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,840
and have to nothing to regret.

245
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,120
Wei Ying!

246
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,680
Is this the promise that we pledged our lives to keep?

247
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,880
Lan Zhan.

248
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,560
If I have to fight with them finally,

249
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,480
I'd prefer to fight with you.

250
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,800
If I am doomed to death,

251
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,080
at least, I could be killed by you.

252
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,920
That would be worth it.

253
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,120
Yiling Patriarch Wei Wuxian.

254
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,280
Xian. Think about a courtesy name.

255
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,040
The next generation of Jin clan is "Ru" generation.

256
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,600
Let's call him Jin Rulan.

257
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,000
Jin Rulan.

258
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,640
Wei Wuxian,

259
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,680
will you make the same choices again?

260
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,760
Aren't you the capable Yiling Patriarch

261
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,600
who can accomplish any tasks?

262
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,280
Let's see,

263
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,000
whether you can grow roots of lotus.

264
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,340
= Fragrance Hall in Jinlintai =

265
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,760
Childe Jin,

266
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,000
all halls and yards

267
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,240
are decorated.

268
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,520
Great!

269
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,400
They are decorated beautifully.

270
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Thank you for your hard working.

271
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
After finishing the rest,

272
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
you can take a half day off.

273
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Then go help the preparation of

274
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,160
the wedding candies and wedding cakes for the guests.

275
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes, Childe.

276
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,800
Why not even a sign of it?

277
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
As a person who grew up in Yunmeng,

278
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,960
why can't I even grow the roots of lotus?

279
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,560
Childe.

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Yes?

281
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,400
Look!

282
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,400
What's this?

283
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
What are you doing?

284
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,600
Yuan.

285
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,480
What happened?

286
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,800
Come here.

287
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,720
Sister.

288
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,720
Yuan picked the precious sprout

289
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
grown by Childe Wei.

290
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,360
Yuan is still a child.

291
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,760
Don't be mad on him.

292
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,280
I'm fine.

293
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,200
It's destiny I see.

294
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,080
Why is brother Xian so angry?

295
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,240
He...

296
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,640
he's fine.

297
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,520
He misses his sister.

298
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,120
Missing his sister?

299
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,120
Just like I do when I miss my sister?

300
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
Yeah, just like that.

301
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,200
If he misses his sister

302
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
when can't he go to see her?

303
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Yuan, you are right.

304
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,880
If one misses his sister, he should go to see her.

305
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,960
Yuan, how about telling brother Xian that?

306
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
OK.

307
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,760
Now go.

308
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Don't rush.

309
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,480
Brother Xian,

310
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,800
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

311
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,680
You, little guy.

312
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,280
When did you enter?

313
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,440
Sister Qing said that

314
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,120
if you misses your sister,

315
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,120
you can just go to see her.

316
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
So far away.

317
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,800
I won't go.

318
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,360
How about become a bird and fly there?

319
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,640
Yuan, it's not that easy to become a bird.

320
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,560
You can. You can.

321
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,920
I can make you fly. I can make you fly.

322
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
- Fine, then you take me to fly. - Quickly.

323
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Fly. Fly.

324
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
Fine.

325
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,720
Fly. Fly. Fly.

326
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,440
Childe Jin.

327
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,960
For now,

328
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,760
are there any other things to be done?

329
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,640
Childe, all is prepared.

330
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,600
All servants

331
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,520
are doing their jobs as you ordered.

332
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,920
Although all is prepared

333
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,280
you should still be careful.

334
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,760
The wedding of Zixuan is a big event of our Jin family.

335
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,400
It should be as perfect as possible.

336
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,080
Understand?

337
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,880
Yes.

338
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,280
It seems that he has devoted himself to this.

339
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,880
It never came to me that he will be so devoted.

340
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,280
Father,

341
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,040
Yao is capable

342
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
and loyal to our family.

343
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,240
In my opinion,

344
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,200
you should no longer keep an eye out for him.

345
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,560
The more capable he is,

346
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,360
there are more worries on my mind.

347
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,440
Anyway,

348
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,280
Zixuan,

349
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,760
you are the one

350
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,800
who will become Clan Leader Jin in the future.

351
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,040
The position

352
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
can't be taken away

353
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,120
by a courtier whose background is not decent enough.

354
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,120
Understand?

355
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,080
Yes, father.

356
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,120
Do you see that? There.

357
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,120
- Amazing. - Great!

358
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,360
Unexpected.

359
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
- It really grows. - Unbelievable.

360
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,960
I didn't expect it can grow here.

361
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,600
Me neither.

362
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,840
- Truly. - Unbelievable.

363
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,160
- What are you doing here? - Childe Wei. Childe Wei.

364
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,040
What the hell are you doing?

365
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,040
Look.

366
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
I've said that

367
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,360
I can grow it there.

368
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,480
- Bravo! - Childe Wei is great!

369
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,760
Childe Wei is great!

370
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,680
Yeah!

371
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,400
- Great! - He is great!

372
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,200
Let's pick the old place.

373
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,800
Brother Li,

374
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,760
are you going to Jinlingtai too?

375
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,720
Yes.

376
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,560
Jin clan is treating cultivators from all directions recently.

377
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,440
I want to go there to share the fun.

378
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,680
Cultivators, may I ask that

379
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,280
what joyous event it is in Jinlintai?

380
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,520
Yiling is really a remote place.

381
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah.

382
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,400
You don't know that?

383
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,600
Mrs. Jin, Childe Jin's wife,

384
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,560
five days ago,

385
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,520
gave birth to a baby successfully.

386
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,560
He is the close paternal grandson of Clan Leader Jin.

387
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
So precious.

388
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,040
Hence,

389
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,760
Jin clan of Lanling is going to hold a banquet for seven days to celebrate it.

390
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,280
What did you say?

391
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,640
Is it real?

392
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,520
Why should we lie to you?

393
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,520
Jin clan announced the news to the world at the first time.

394
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,720
The baby was named already.

395
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,480
Family name is Jin. Surname Ling. Courtesy name Rulan.

396
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,200
You are so short of news.

397
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,360
Come, have a drink.

398
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
Wen Ning, did you hear that?

399
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,160
My sister has a baby.

400
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,720
I have a nephew.

401
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,160
Congratulations, Childe Wei.

402
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,160
Look,

403
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,720
so cute.

404
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,880
Clan Leader Jin,

405
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,160
Zewu Jun and Hanguang Jun arrived.

406
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,360
Got it, you may leave.

407
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,320
The child,

408
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,000
is so heart-warming.

409
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,520
He has such a beautiful smile.

410
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,000
Father,

411
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,160
Second bro and Hanguang Jun have arrived at the Pageant Hall.

412
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,880
Let me hold Jin Ling please.

413
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,560
How can you hold him?

414
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,000
You know how to hold a baby?

415
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,360
You may drop the baby.

416
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,800
Wet nurse.

417
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,280
Come here. Come here.

418
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,160
Hold the baby.

419
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,640
Only you can hold him.

420
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,040
Yes.

421
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,280
The others are not allowed.

422
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,120
Why you hurry me?

423
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,360
No need to hurry.

424
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,280
Hanguang Jun.

425
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,760
Did I hear it correctly?

426
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,640
Would you please repeat it?

427
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,040
I said since all seniors

428
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,400
will be invited at the first-month celebration of Jin Ling.

429
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,320
Wei Ying, as his senior, should be invited.

430
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,040
So what you mean is that

431
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,920
Wei Wuxian is his senior,

432
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,040
so even if he's the enemy of four main clans,

433
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
you want to invite him, right?

434
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,400
Not an enemy.

435
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,630
Not an enemy?

436
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,360
Should he be our friend?

437
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,080
Hanguang Jun,

438
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,670
do you really have a poor memory?

439
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,960
So you forgot the murder in Qiongqi Road.

440
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Should I remind you of that?

441
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,520
Childe Jin,

442
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
what Wangji said isn't wrong.

443
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,480
Wei Wuxian didn't cause any trouble after he became

444
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,670
independent in Burial Mounds.

445
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,670
And I never heard

446
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,000
that he did anything against

447
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,480
the chivalrous spirit.

448
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,560
Zewu Jun,

449
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,000
you too want to stand up for Wei Wuxian

450
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,960
that traitor?

451
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,120
I...

452
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Second brother's here.

453
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,080
I'm late.

454
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,710
Father.

455
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,760
Zixun,

456
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,040
what happened?

457
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,000
Which servant made you angry?

458
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,720
I'll give him a lesson.

459
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
A lesson?

460
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,760
Maybe you are not qualified to do that.

461
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,160
Second brother. This...

462
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,320
- Fine. - Zixun.

463
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,040
How can you speak in this way?

464
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,640
Quickly. Give a salute and apologize to

465
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,160
Zewu Jun and Hanguang Jun.

466
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,080
Uncle,

467
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
do you know

468
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,480
what Hanguang Jun just said?

469
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,880
What?

470
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,600
Hanguang Jun just suggested that

471
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
Wei Wuxian should be invited

472
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,680
to Ling's first-month celebration.

473
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,880
Although Hanguang Jun is out of kindness,

474
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,720
this way may be inappropriate.

475
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,920
In my opinion,

476
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,280
in Hanguang Jun's mind,

477
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,560
this is the best way.

478
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
I know that

479
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,840
Hanguang Jun had been to Burial Mounds before.

480
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,040
But I don't know what Hanguang Jun went there for.

481
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,840
Visit an old friend.

482
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,360
Old friend?

483
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,240
Wei Wuxian is a ruthless killer.

484
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,680
People all want to eradicate him.

485
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,520
Why you have an old friend like him?

486
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,040
When did he kill ruthlessly?

487
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,360
Please tell us exactly.

488
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,160
You!

489
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,120
Enough.

490
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,360
Father,

491
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,560
although Wei Wuxian is rebellious

492
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,320
and had murdered some people of Jin clan.

493
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,680
Yet, as what Hanguang Jun said,

494
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,680
he didn't do anything wrong in the whole year.

495
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,400
He has seceded from Jiang clan.

496
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,640
But,

497
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
Yanli still misses him so much.

498
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,880
I think this is a good opportunity

499
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,280
to call him back.

500
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,840
Zixuan, are you out of your mind?

501
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
Childe Jin's words do make senses.

502
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,880
If Wei Wuxian has the intention to change

503
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,880
and return to the right path,

504
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,800
it's a joyous thing.

505
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,360
It seems real that no one heard

506
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,160
any misdeeds of Yiling Patriarch.

507
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,560
Even Stygian Tiger Amulet has disappeared.

508
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
But this matter,

509
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,440
though having concern with four main clans,

510
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,520
is the family affair of Jin clan and Jiang clan after all.

511
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,920
We should listen to Clan Leader Jin's opinion.

512
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,040
Wei Wuxian is such a rebel.

513
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,960
However,

514
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,360
as what Zewu Jun said,

515
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,280
if Wei Wuxian want to regret now,

516
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,360
a big potential problem posed to four clans

517
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,040
can be solved.

518
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,320
Jin clan of Lanling

519
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,440
can wipe out

520
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,880
all grievances between us.

521
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,960
Uncle!

522
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,040
But...

523
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,120
Clan Leader Jin, you can speak it directly.

524
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,920
Zewu Jun,

525
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,000
you know

526
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
that Burial Mounds is not built by

527
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,040
Wei Wuxian himself.

528
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,960
There are so many

529
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,160
members of Wen supporting him.

530
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
You know that Jin clan of Lanling

531
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,560
has blood feud with the Wens.

532
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,000
Fine, so at the very least,

533
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,920
we can let go of these remnants of Wen,

534
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,680
but there is

535
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,920
Stygian Tiger Amulet in his hand

536
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,040
which can kill and turn people into manipulable puppets.

537
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,320
Besides,

538
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,520
that Ghost General Wen Ning

539
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,320
is also troublesome.

540
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,760
Father.

541
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,120
Second brother.

542
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,320
I have a method but I'm not sure it's viable or not.

543
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,600
Speak.

544
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,280
Since all of us want to call Wei Wuxian back,

545
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,080
why not write a letter

546
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,520
to aske him to come to Jinlintai alone

547
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,600
and attend the first-month celebration.

548
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,200
After he's here,

549
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,360
we can persuade him with tactful words

550
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,480
into handing in Stygian Tiger Amulet,

551
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,920
and giving an account to everyone.

552
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,240
If he agrees,

553
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,440
we can announce his return to Jiang clan of Yunmeng

554
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,400
in that day.

555
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,360
Isn't it another good news?

556
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,040
What will you do if he disagrees?

557
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,440
Why is Hanguang Jun so pessimistic?

558
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,240
Childe Wei is not evil or vicious.

559
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,720
If we persuade him tactfully,

560
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,400
he is reasonable enough to accept it.

561
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,040
Besides, Mrs. Jin and Childe Wei have a good relation like siblings.

562
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,560
I'm afraid he won't want to leave

563
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,640
when he sees little Ling.

564
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,120
Yeah!

565
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,040
Even if he disagrees,

566
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,040
he can go back to Burial Mounds

567
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,440
as long as he promises that he won't kill the innocents.

568
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,360
Exactly.

569
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,640
Zixun,

570
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,920
are you OK?

571
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,680
Hence,

572
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,920
Hanguang Jun.

573
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,480
Can we bother you with

574
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,000
the errand of sending the letter?

575
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,040
OK.

576
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,160
Is it true?

577
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,320
Rulan,

578
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
your uncle Xian

579
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,200
is coming to your first-month celebration.

580
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,600
Are you delighted?

581
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,120
Zixun,

582
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,280
Zixun,

583
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,960
what happened?

584
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,080
Why you are here?

585
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,480
I know that you are disappointed today in the hall.

586
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,600
Yet,

587
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,320
you need to understand father.

588
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,000
He made the decision for the four main clans.

589
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,880
Enough,

590
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,920
I don't want to listen to these words.

591
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,040
Fine.

592
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,720
Then I'll stop.

593
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,120
Zixun,

594
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,920
do you...

595
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,040
have any personal grudge against Childe Wei?
