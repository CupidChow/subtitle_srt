1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I thought it was a black cat.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I thought it was a black cat.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Right.

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
For many years,

15
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,540
My spirit's been keeping this place.

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,480
This land nothin 170 is meant for thevate.

17
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,760
Then how's the lust acrylic festering?

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're a master?

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, senior.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm a無限.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was raised by the Jiang family.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But the dirty person is my family.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The dirty person of Baoshan is my master.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's been so many years.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Back then,

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Baoshan didn't have a way to get it.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I didn't expect that now,

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
he even has a grandson.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He's standing in front of me.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a pity that

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
he can't get out of the fire

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because of me.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've never had the face to look for him.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Senior,

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have a question.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But you asked me to go into this place.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My spiritual power has been suppressed for a hundred years.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a barrier to protect the back mountain.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But in the past ten years,

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
my spiritual power has been severely damaged.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
My spiritual power is getting weaker and weaker.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm afraid

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the spirit of this fire has been in the water.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Senior, why did the fire suddenly start

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
when it was 20 years ago?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If I'm right,

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
it's because the other fire is broken.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's already gone.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It seems that the one we saw last time

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
was the one who was killed by the spirit

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
by the spirit

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and was forced to come back.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They are in the dead end.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Since I opened the seal,

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the fire has been broken

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and I've been able to re-enter the fire.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can live a peaceful life

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
for a hundred years.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can live a peaceful life

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
for a hundred years.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm lucky.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm worried about this day.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I should be more reliable.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Senior,

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is there no way to make the seal

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to harm the people?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The seal is a natural material that cannot be entered.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And it's broken into pieces.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a wishful thinking.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There must be a demon hidden in the place.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The only way is

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to find the pieces of the seal

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and have them in the dark.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Unfortunately,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't go forward

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and make the mistake of turning down.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Senior.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't panic.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've been waiting for

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
a hundred years

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to return the seal.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now that you're here,

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't need to worry about it anymore.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I forgot that as a descendant of Lan clan,

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I will do this.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will make Senior's wish.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will find the seal and have it in the dark.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will do this too.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is Lan clan's matter.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I have nothing to do with you.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lan Zhan, you can't stop me.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Although Wei Ying grew up in the Jiang clan,

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
he never called me.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Moreover,

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I have been in the dark for a hundred years.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can't do anything about it.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The path of the mountain is like this.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Remember.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The matter of the dark is difficult.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No matter what,

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I hope you won't repeat my orders.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't worry, Senior.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wei Ying will do her best.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Senior,

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
haven't you told us

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
where the other pieces are?

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The place of the Clouds

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is the barrier in the back.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it to protect this mountain?

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Miss Wen.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Young Master Jiang.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Miss Wen,

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
are you here to find Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji?

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Lan Zhan!

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Lan Zhan,

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I didn't mean to.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Wei Wuxian.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Jiang Cheng?

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Get up.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Please.

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wen Qing.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Jiang Cheng.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why are you two here?

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I should ask you this.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wei Wuxian,

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
where have you been all day?

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you know

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
my sister is worried about her meal?

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
She can't sleep.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If she can't find you again,

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
she will have to tell my father

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
about the Huilianhua Wudang.

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's been a day and a night.

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ze Wujun has been looking for you.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He is not resting.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you know

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
how anxious everyone is?

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Where have you been?

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll tell you later.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't tell you clearly.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Wait.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You two

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
have deep regrets in every word.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is inside?

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,320
We were in the cold-blooded

148
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,000
and the water was flowing.

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is it?

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How did this happen?

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We were trapped in that place.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We spent a lot of time

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
to find this cave.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What's inside?

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What else?

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Except the ice, it's water.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll tell you.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I was almost frozen there.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's talk later.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't use it.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We'll talk later.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's talk later.

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's talk later.

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's go.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's go.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's go.

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No one can escape from this.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Uncle.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Brother.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You've known this for a long time.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Since you broke the barrier,

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the Blue Division closed the back mountain.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was afraid the cause of the matter

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
would be affected.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So the five masters

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and only the master of the Blue Division

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
knew what happened.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So they took the lead.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They took the lead.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They took the lead.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They knew what happened to the Yin Iron.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They took the lead.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So the Soul of the Red Division

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
was the cause of the water.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Ze Wu Jun, you knew

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
it might be related to the Yin Iron.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Master Wei is very clever.

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When the Blue Division was in the past,

191
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
he guessed half of it.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Wang Jie.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You asked me

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
but I couldn't tell you.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What's the matter?

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Now that the situation is getting worse,

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I've guessed that it's related to the Yin Iron.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I went to the place to check the barrier.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's really a bit of a shame.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This time, the uncle went to the Qing River

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to discuss this matter with the Sect Leader Nie.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But I didn't expect

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you would enter the Han Tantan Cave so quickly.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I didn't expect the Yin Iron would be in danger.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's the Qishan Manor again.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No need to say.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It seems that the Qishan Manor came to study

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
for the Yin Iron.

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Master Lan used to say

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that the Yin Iron has been in operation for the past ten years.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's because of other pieces of the Yin Iron.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It seems that we've got a good idea.

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wen Ruohan has already got a piece of Yin Iron.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And the spirit of the god

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
doesn't know anything about it.

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So he asked people to investigate.

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How did Wen Ruohan know

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that the shards of the shards are in the same place?

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The Yin Iron is in the four directions.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But after a hundred years,

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
no one knows

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
where the shards are.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But Wen Ruohan

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
can actually take out a piece of Yin Iron.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sure that someone will help him.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Master Lan used to say

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that the Yin Iron

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
can be used to protect the feeling.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Since we already have a piece,

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
why don't we have a smooth sketch?

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Uncle.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Brother.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What should we do now?

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If Yin Iron is in operation,

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
once it is in the hands of the person who has the heart broken,

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it will surely cause blood and heart attack.

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The only thing that can be done is to seal it again.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And then put it back in the Shards.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then re-create it.

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No one can approach it.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Uncle.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now Wen Ruohan has a piece of Yin Iron.

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So there are all kinds of connections between them.

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Even if we put it back in the Shards,

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
it will be too late.

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Moreover,

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
if we put it back in the Yin Iron,

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
we won't be able to hide it.

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's a good idea.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Uncle.

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We'll talk about it later.

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Today's matter is about the late-night secret.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Well,

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
don't worry, sir.

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I promise I won't tell anyone.

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Wei Xiao.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wei Xiao.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I...

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Lan Er.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Wei Xiao.

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I knew you would come back alive.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Where have you been?

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was looking for you.

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You must be in love again.

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't worry.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I won't be in love this time.

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But the place of the Cloud Recesses is too big.

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It seems that even Mr. Lan Er

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
is almost lost.

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He can't even get lost in the cold.

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Have you ever met any strange jade?

272
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Strange jade?

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There's one.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Do you want to hear it?

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, I'll listen to it.

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Come on.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Last night,

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
the night was dark.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Under the cold,

280
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
a pair of beasts suddenly appeared.

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
They pulled me and Lan Zhan into the water.

282
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Guess what that beast is.

283
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What?

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Snake medicine.

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't go.

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you want to know what the snake medicine looks like?

287
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't say that.

288
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm afraid of snakes.

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You'd better keep this jade slowly.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll go first.

291
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
By the way, don't forget to put it on.

292
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Go ahead.

293
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Jiang Cheng.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Jiang Cheng.

295
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Why are you so fast?

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Wei Wuxian.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Are you familiar with Lan Wangji?

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I think you should

299
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
stay at the Cloud Recesses

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
under the head of the Lan clan.

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What are you thinking?

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Where can I get the Cloud Recesses?

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's just three thousand jade.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's a fixed rate.

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You want me to die?

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't think about it.

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's go.

308
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll go.

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Father.

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The Cloud Recesses have been revealed.

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Congratulations, father.

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Congratulations.

313
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Did you get it?

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Xueyang.

315
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Xie Du.

316
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yueyang.

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Go.

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yueyang is a city.

319
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can do whatever you want.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I only want the jade.

321
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Thank you, Xie Du.

322
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Xueyang.

323
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I won't say anything else.

324
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Xie Du, don't worry.

325
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not interested in the jade.

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Besides,

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm just a minor minor.

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
How can I escape from Xie Du's control heart?

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Father.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How can you promise that little bastard to go to Yueyang?

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't let you go.

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But father.

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If Xueyang has a second heart,

334
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
then...

335
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Your mission is to take people to the jade.

336
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If Xueyang has any action,

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
what should you do?

338
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The Cloud Recesses have been revealed.

339
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Did father know it?

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Gu Sulan can't turn the world upside down.

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He's going to make the world a mess.

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But...

343
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If you don't let me go,

344
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll have no choice.

345
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll put the light on.

346
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Lan Zhan.

347
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's put the light on

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the part of our lives.

349
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm used to it.

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You can change it if you're used to it.

351
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Besides,

352
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm doing this for you.

353
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Look.

354
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're laughing?

355
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Brother Hu Wei.

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
My light is the best in the world.

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I finally made it.

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
How can you burn it?

359
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You're so mean.

360
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'll just pay you a favor.

361
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This is the product of our seven-legged club.

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's as good as silk,

363
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
as fine as silk,

364
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and the price is so high.

365
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm not going to let you go.

366
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm not going to let you go.

367
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm not going to let you go.

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm not going to let you go.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not going to let you go.

370
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Look.

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I hope you can make it to the top.

372
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You can't just leave the world without me.

373
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't want you to get involved.

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll protect you and you,

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and I'll be safe.

376
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not going to let you go.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm not going to let you go.

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm not going to let you go.

379
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm not going to let you go.

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let me just run.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let me just run.

382
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let me just run.

383
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Black SEAL

384
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,960
Don't be naughty.

385
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,920
You're lying.

386
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,360
It must be a good cause.

387
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Miss Jiang's cause has been settled.

388
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,560
Why do you ask?

389
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,880
The Wolf King is right here.

390
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,720
How can you let Miss Jiang go alone?

391
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Didn't you just use the lamp?

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,480
I heard that you and Miss Jiang will get married soon.

393
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,960
Why don't you let her go and ask for a good marriage?

394
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
Yes, yes, sir.

395
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,720
I've known you for a year

396
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,040
since I last met you.

397
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm sure I can bless you for a hundred years.

398
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,160
Nianmian, it's late.

399
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,400
Let's go.

400
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,440
Where are you going?

401
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,360
Don't you have any line?

402
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
Sir, what's wrong?

403
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,720
We're not going to the river.

404
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,440
Did they turn off the light?

405
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
Okay, I'll ask them.

406
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,720
Sir, I'm sorry.

407
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,760
You and Miss Jiang have a engagement.

408
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Don't you want others to laugh at you?

409
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
Sir.

410
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,280
Nianmian, listen.

411
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,320
This marriage is not my intention.

412
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
Don't mention it again.

413
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Wait.

414
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,640
What do you mean?

415
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,840
Wei Wuxian,

416
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
is this related to you?

417
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,160
Sir.

418
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,160
What do you mean? Don't mention it again.

419
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,320
Don't mention it again.

420
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,160
Is it hard to understand?

421
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,640
Miss Jiang.

422
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,760
Miss Jiang.

423
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,640
Something's wrong.

424
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,600
Mr. Wei.

425
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,440
Mr. Wei.

426
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,920
Mr. Wei.

427
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,640
He and our young master are fighting.

428
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,760
I can't beat you.

429
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,240
Don't stop me.

430
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,960
Come here.

431
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,600
Beat you to death.

432
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,240
Don't stop me.

433
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,840
Come on.

434
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,280
Wei Wuxian.

435
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,200
Don't stop me.

436
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,200
Wei Ying.

437
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,680
Hold it.

438
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,320
Don't stop me.

439
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,920
Let go of me.

440
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,000
Take it.

441
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,080
Don't stop me.

442
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,960
Let go of me, He Xin.

443
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,160
Come on.

444
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,760
Come here.

445
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,080
Don't stop me.

446
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,920
He Xin.

447
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,440
He Xin.

448
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,400
It's said that

449
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
Jin Zixuan can't see Miss Jiang.

450
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,360
You...

451
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,160
He wants to get her divorced.

452
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,240
Wei Wuxian is in a bad mood for her sister.

453
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,600
She's in a bad mood for her sister.

454
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
She's in a bad mood for her sister.

455
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,600
Ah Xian.

456
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,840
Let's go home.

457
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,960
Wei Ying.

458
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
You have my own feelings.

459
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,040
I don't have to work for you alone.

460
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,720
Lan Zhan.

461
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
Lan Zhan, Look at that!

462
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:38,420
Everyşey demon is doing up your

463
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,880
Summary.

464
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,080
teeth are mouthy,

465
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,800
mastered from the beginning.

466
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
But his teeth...

467
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,360
His teeth are so cute.

468
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Uncle Jiang, why are you here?

469
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Kneel down.

470
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
You are a noble teacher.

471
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I am noble, but you don't know.

472
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,160
But the person who is so brave

473
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
must be a good teacher.

474
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,160
But Jin Zixuan is so brave.

475
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
He must be very proud.

476
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
If I don't kneel down today,

477
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
he will cry and shout.

478
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
I am not happy.

479
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
You are so shameless.

480
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
I am here to tell you

481
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
that I am not even a few miles away from here.

482
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
I will be taught by that old man.

483
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Jin Zixuan, you are dead.

484
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Mr. Lan.

485
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Brother Xiang.

486
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
The two chiefs are on their way to the prison.

487
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Please sit down.

488
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
This time, we are in a hurry.

489
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Although it is just a mess,

490
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,160
we have to wait until the two families of Jinjiang are married.

491
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
I don't want to be in a hurry.

492
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
I don't want to be in a hurry.

493
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I don't want to be in a hurry.

494
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
I don't want to be in a hurry.

495
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,160
So, I have to ask the two chiefs

496
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
to discuss it personally.

497
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
I understand the matter.

498
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I am not sure if I should be honest.

499
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I have put a lot of trouble for you.

500
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I am sorry that I have to teach you a lesson.

501
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Brother Xiang.

502
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
You don't have to.

503
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
I know what to do.

504
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I will go back and take good care of Xuan.

505
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I have already followed the rules of the family.

506
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,160
You two chiefs, you don't have to do this.

507
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,160
But, this marriage is not a game.

508
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Mr. Lan is right.

509
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Marriage is not a game.

510
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I am sorry.

511
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Brother Jin, I have a favor to ask.

512
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
I dare not.

513
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Please tell me, Brother Xiang.

514
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I, Yun Meng Jiang,

515
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,160
have always been the leader of the family.

516
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I never force my children to do things they don't like.

517
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Although we have already engaged in a marriage,

518
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,160
we should have decided on the motherly position.

519
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Now it seems that the two sides are not happy.

520
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
We should not force it.

521
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Father.

522
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Brother Xiang.

523
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Children are not sensible.

524
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
It's just a misunderstanding.

525
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
We don't have to understand.

526
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Brother Jin, we can help them to make a engagement.

527
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,160
But we can't replace them for their wedding.

528
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,160
After all, what they will do together in the future is their own.

529
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I have already sent a letter to Ali's mother.

530
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
The wedding is still a good thing.

531
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Brother Jiang, it's my honor to be here.

532
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,160
I have a good marriage.

533
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Since you have decided,

534
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,160
it's better to make a toast.

535
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:03,160
But don't affect our friendship.

536
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
How can it be?

537
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
We have no time.

538
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I have to cancel the engagement with Jin Zixuan.

539
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
What?

540
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Jin Zixuan hasn't given up yet?

541
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
How dare she cancel the engagement?

542
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
No, it's father's proposal.

543
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Uncle Jiang proposed it.

544
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Where is Sister?

545
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
She must be in the room.

546
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Mr. Lan.

547
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Chief Jiang.

548
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Chief Jiang, it's not over yet.

549
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,160
This time, I invite you here.

550
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
There is another key to the engagement.

551
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Please go ahead.

552
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Chief Jiang, it's not strange.

553
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
This matter is very important.

554
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
We have to be careful.

555
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I don't know if you heard about the current situation.

556
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Feng Mian has a question.

557
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
In the construction of the forest,

558
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
even Yunmeng has happened.

559
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't know why this happened.

560
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Feng Mian still needs to be treated.

561
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
These things happened

562
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
because of a 100-year-old spirit

563
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,160
that has been re-established.

564
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
And I, Yin Tian.

565
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Ah Xin, I know it's you.

567
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Ah Xin.

568
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Sister, I...

569
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
It's been so long.

570
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Is there anything wrong?

571
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
How is the suit? Let me see.

572
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Sister.

573
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
It's all my fault.

574
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Why don't you scold me?

575
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
I'll be more familiar with it.

576
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Ah Xin, this matter has nothing to do with you.

577
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't think too much.

578
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
I can't tell you

579
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
what happened to Yuan Feng.

580
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Sister,

581
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
you will marry a 100 times more powerful

582
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
than her.

583
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
A 100,000 times more powerful than the Ruyi Wolf Army.

584
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Then Ah Xin will

585
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
marry a talented and virtuous fairy.

586
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
I don't want to.

587
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
I just want to stay in Lianhua House

588
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
with sister.

589
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Ah Xin,

590
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
the school is over.

591
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
In two days,

592
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
we will go back to Yunmeng.

593
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
The school is over?

594
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
You haven't finished yet?

595
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Father said

596
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
when Ah Cheng comes back,

597
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
we will go to the Ya City

598
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
and ask Mr. Lan to resign.

599
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I...

600
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I didn't expect

601
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
there is still a reason behind it.

602
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm not hiding from you, Sect Leader Jiang.

603
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
The most worried thing now

604
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
is the most early-division

605
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
of the current situation.

606
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
If we are not

607
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
able to use the new books,

608
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
and we are to be re-reliant,

609
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
we will surely be in a bad situation.

610
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
The weather is so warm.

611
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
The clouds are so clear.

612
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
In that case,

613
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Feng Mian also heard

614
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
a strange thing on the road.

615
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
In the past days,

616
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
the Yuer Yang generation,

617
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
several of the ancestors,

618
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
the Lianxu,

619
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
the Chuanxi,

620
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
the Yuer Yang generation,

621
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
were all dead.

622
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I wonder who

623
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
is behind it.

624
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
But it seems that the murderer

625
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
is a young and polite young man

626
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
named Xue.

627
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
What is going on?

628
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
It seems that the Wen family

629
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
is also on the road.

630
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
We have to be careful.

631
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Master.

632
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Come in.

633
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Master,

634
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Mr. Xia Lan.

635
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Sect Leader Lan.

636
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
This is your seat.

637
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Master,

638
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
I have a reward for the merit.

639
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
I have the right to punish you.

640
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Master Wei,

641
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
you have been punished

642
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
for being so careless

643
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
in the Cloud Recesses.

644
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
As for the merit,

645
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
I think

646
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
you have your reward.

647
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
What merit can he have?

648
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Sect Leader Jiang,

649
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Wei Ying should really

650
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
be a good teacher.

651
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
He didn't come to Yuanxin.

652
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
These family members

653
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
have no one to rely on.

654
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
But since Wei Ying came,

655
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
these thief and thief

656
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
and cowardly little guys

657
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
were all choked by him.

658
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
The night-time drinker

659
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
of the night-time drinker.

660
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
That's what I always do.

661
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Mr. Lan,

662
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
you have to take care of him.

663
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Come in.

664
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Wang Ji,

665
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
what's the matter?

666
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Sect Leader Lan,

667
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
I'll take my leave.

668
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
Sect Leader Jiang.

669
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Don't worry, Sect Leader Lan.

670
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I know I'm good at this.

671
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
If you have the right to do so,

672
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I will definitely

673
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
take the responsibility

674
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
of the Cloud Recesses.

675
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Mr. Lan,

676
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Mr. Lan,

677
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Mr. Lan.

678
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Please don't go through this.

679
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Sect Leader Jiang, take care.

680
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Okay.

681
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Lan Zhan,

682
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
it's about the Cloud Recesses.

683
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
Lan Zhan,

684
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
let's go.

685
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Wang Ji,

686
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
be careful.

687
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Wei Wuxian,

688
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
are you deaf?

689
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Lan Wang Ji hates you so much.

690
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Why do you keep looking for me?

691
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Why do you keep looking for me?

692
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Why?

693
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
I can't go to a farewell

694
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
with you.

695
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
You're so modest.

696
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Lan Wang Ji heard that you left.

697
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
He must be happy.

698
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Nonsense.

699
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Let me tell you,

700
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
everyone in the family

701
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
likes me.

702
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Everyone can't bear to see me.

703
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Senior Sister,

704
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
do you think so?

705
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
Yes.

706
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
A Xie and I

707
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
like each other the most.

708
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Then let me ask you,

709
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
why do you

710
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
only want to say goodbye

711
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
to Lan Zhan?

712
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
I don't like him.

713
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
You can't beat me.

714
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I'm a lonely person.

715
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
It's not easy

716
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
to win a fight.

717
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
You're shameless.

718
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Who's shameless?

719
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
The one who's doing it is shameless.

720
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
How is it?

721
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
You're the one who said it.

722
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Okay, you two.

723
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
You can't fight

724
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
anywhere in the world.

725
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
You won't be late

726
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
when you play with the flower.

727
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Okay, Senior Sister.

728
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
I know, Senior Sister.

729
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Don't worry.

730
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I won't beat him.

731
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Wei Wuxian, you...

732
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
You...

733
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Stop right there.

734
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Stop right there.

735
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Why are you hitting me?

736
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
You two,

737
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
stop it.

738
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Senior Sister, look.

739
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Okay, okay.

740
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
Stop it.

741
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Stop.

742
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
I don't know where I am.

743
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
I'm just a little bit late.

744
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Zhang Chong,

745
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
what are you doing?

746
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Senior Sister, look at him.

747
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Don't say that.

748
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,500
Mr. Wei جان幹嘛 Interestingly,

749
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,900
he's gone somewhere else.

750
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Wangjia.

751
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
You've started looking for Yin Tie's connect.

752
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Should I tell that to him?

753
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
I don't need him.

754
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,320
Merci.

755
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,840
Remember to focus on your rest.

756
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,080
Thank you.

757
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,520
Little rabbit.

758
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,280
Little rabbit.

759
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I'm relieved that you're happy.

760
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Do you think I should bring you back to Lotus House?

761
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
No, no, no.

762
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,280
If Lan Zhan is bored and wants to find you, he can't find you.

763
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
But...

764
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Wang Jian, be careful.

765
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Where can he go on his own?

766
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Could it be that he went to the Yin Iron alone?

767
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,280
The clouds are still in the sky.

768
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,280
The rain and the rain are all forgotten.

769
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,280
How can I wait for you?

770
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,280
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

771
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,280
The snow is falling like a wind.

772
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
The mountains and the water are all gone.

773
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
The clouds are still in the sky.

774
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
The rain and the rain are all forgotten.

775
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,280
How can I wait for you?

776
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,280
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

777
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,280
The moon is still in the sky.

778
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,280
How can I wait for you?

779
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,280
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

780
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,280
The clouds are still in the sky.

781
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,280
The rain and the rain are all forgotten.

782
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,280
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

783
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,280
How can I wait for you?

784
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,280
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

785
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
The clouds are still in the sky.

786
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,280
The sky is still in the sky.
