1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fifth one is the first one.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
imperial commander

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's very important

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The elder brother

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why are you lookingly at me?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,480
Brother Wei.

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
What's the matter?

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
You're not hungry anymore?

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm hungry.

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
It's been 16 years.

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
The alcohol content in Lan Zhan hasn't changed at all.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
It's still the same taste.

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,120
What's wrong?

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Lan Zhan?

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
Lan Zhan?

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hey.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Wen Ning, it's you!

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's wrong? You don't recognize me?

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What the hell is this?

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Stand still.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hands up.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll take care of it.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wen Ning can hold the steel ring in her hand

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and not let it be in her body.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This experience

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
must be something that someone wants to control.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The one who stays with Wen Ning

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
can't let her think about it.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll follow the other person's order.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
After all, if I destroy the god's order,

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
if that's the case...

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I knew it.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll take care of it.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That day,

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I and my sister went to the Golden Forest Platform

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and was locked up by the Golden Sect Leader.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then my memory got more and more confused.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It seemed like

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
someone locked me in a dark place.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I came to check it out

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
until I heard your voice.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then who did you get in?

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When did you get controlled by this steel ring?

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you still remember it?

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wen Ning.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What are you doing?

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Young Master.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You've been like this for so many years.

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Is that okay?

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's wrong?

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What's wrong?

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's wrong?

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's wrong?

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong?

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Young Master.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Look at you.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're so brave to talk like this.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is that okay?

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But...

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
everything is because of me.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Without me,

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I wouldn't have been able to get you.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Everything is because of you.

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But you're so great.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If that's the case,

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
get you back to your original self

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
for a thousand times.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How can I let you die today?

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wen Qin is right.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're a knife.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And you're a treasure.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a treasure.

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's not a gift of love.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The Lanling Jin clan was declared to be

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the second-in-law of your sister's

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and the wrong-doer.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now you're a ghost.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're not living well, are you?

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You always hang on to me.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're not the one who's looking for a way.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I have to find a new sword to cut you off.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How about this?

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wait here.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll go back to the inn.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If Lan Zhan is still awake,

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
forget it.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If he's asleep,

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll borrow his secret weapon.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Lan Zhan,

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you're awake.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I just said

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll borrow your secret weapon.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's definitely not a steal.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Lan Zhan, you...

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Lan Zhan.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Lan Zhan.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Lan Zhan, look at you.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You ran out of your sleep.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Go back to sleep.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't move.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Lan Zhan,

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't think I can find the way back.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Lan Zhan,

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
what are you doing?

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Lan Zhan,

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
what are you doing?

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Lan Zhan.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Lan Zhan.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Hold this.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Wait,

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
why are you giving me a chicken?

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not giving you a chicken.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why are you giving me a chicken?

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you doing?

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
These chickens are from the master.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're...

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You know it's a steal, right?

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Are you fat?

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Fat, so fat.

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're so awesome.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll give it to you.

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll give it to you.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Poor Lan Zhan.

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He was born in a family.

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He was forced to marry a man

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
with three thousand rules.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He was so drunk.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He was even more crazy than me.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Lan Zhan,

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
what are you doing?

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Lan Wangji,

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is he here?

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Lan Zhan,

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
can we stop talking?

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Go back to sleep.

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Listen to me.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's go.

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's go.

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's go.

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Lan Zhan,

202
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
wait for me.

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't move.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Lan Zhan,

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it's done.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Let's go.

207
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Let's go.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Lan Zhan,

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you're the one who turned off the light.

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Lan Zhan.

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So,

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Lan Zhan's way of fighting

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
is Lan's master?

214
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,900
Bin rod

215
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,060
Thank you

216
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Thank you.

217
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
The transmission service.

218
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Lan Zhan! Lan Zhan! He's gone.

219
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Lan Zhan! It's okay. It's okay. He's gone.

220
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Hey!

221
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Here.

222
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Listen to me. I'm really tired.

223
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,060
I won't let you drink again.

224
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
I...

225
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,060
Water...

226
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Okay, okay. I'll pour it for you.

227
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
It's done.

228
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,060
What are you doing?

229
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,060
I told you to drink the water inside.

230
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
It's done.

231
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
It's done.

232
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Look at you.

233
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,060
Lan Zhan, I think you should remember everything after you wake up.

234
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Otherwise, you'll be ashamed to see me.

235
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,060
Lan Zhan!

236
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
What time is it?

237
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,060
So, it's time to ask the right time.

238
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:11,060
Have you ever had a smile that doesn't know where you are?

239
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
No.

240
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Have you ever had a toast?

241
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Yes.

242
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Do you like rabbits?

243
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
I like them.

244
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Lan Zhan, you finally admit it.

245
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Why did you help me?

246
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I regret it.

247
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
What regret?

248
00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:00,060
I didn't stand with you in the middle of the night.

249
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,060
I didn't stand with you.

250
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,060
So, you've been looking for me these years?

251
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,060
Lan Zhan, remember this.

253
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,060
It has nothing to do with you.

254
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,060
I betrayed you.

255
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
I'm a thief.

256
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,060
It's all my own choice.

257
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Do you understand?

258
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

259
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Lan Zhan, did you hear me?

260
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,060
It's time to rest.

261
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

262
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
I'm going to sleep.

263
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

264
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
I'm going to sleep.

265
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

266
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm going to sleep.

267
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

268
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,060
I'm going to sleep.

269
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

270
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,060
I'm going to sleep.

271
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

272
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm going to sleep.

273
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

274
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

275
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
I'm going to sleep.

276
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

277
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,060
I'm going to sleep.

278
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

279
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
I'm going to sleep.

280
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

281
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I'm going to sleep.

282
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

283
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm going to sleep.

284
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

285
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
I'm going to sleep.

286
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

287
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm going to sleep.

288
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
Stop running!

289
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Stop running!

290
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
Stop running!

291
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,060
Stop running!

292
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,060
Stop running!

293
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
I'm so useless.

294
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
I'm not too good at it yet.

295
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Who's going to be the boss now?

296
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,060
Of course it's me.

297
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
I'm Jin Guangyao.

298
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
I killed the big evil in my family.

299
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
I'm Nie Mingjue.

300
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
I'm the most skilled in the battle.

301
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
The most skilled in the battle.

302
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
I'm the boss.

303
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,060
But I'm the first one.

304
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
What about the first one? You're my third brother.

305
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
If you don't see me, you'll have to run away.

306
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060
You're a short-lived man.

307
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
Jin Zixuan, you're even shorter than me.

308
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
What's the short-lived man?

309
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
I'm the third one.

310
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
I'm the third one.

311
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Stop running.

312
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
I'm the 13th one.

313
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
I'm the most skilled.

314
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
The boss is the boss.

315
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
Do you think it's Han Guangjue?

316
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Gentlemen,

317
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,060
can I ask you a question?

318
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,060
What do you want to ask?

319
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
I want to ask

320
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,060
why the boss is not here?

321
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Erwa, Sanpao, you're going to die.

322
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
You're not going home to eat.

323
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
You're playing again.

324
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
Hurry up.

325
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Boss, come back.

326
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Run.

327
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,060
Lan Zhan, you're awake.

328
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
Last night...

329
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
You...

330
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
You didn't do anything last night.

331
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
You only said a lot of things.

332
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
What?

333
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Actually, nothing.

334
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Actually, nothing.

335
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
Actually, you just said

336
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,060
like,

337
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,060
I like...

338
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
I like rabbits.

339
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060
You like rabbits?

340
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
What's wrong?

341
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
They're so cute. Who doesn't like them?

342
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
I like them too.

343
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
I like them.

344
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
What did I do last night?

345
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
No, no, no. You didn't do anything last night.

346
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
I'm so bored.

347
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Lan Zhan, I'm going to tell you the truth.

348
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Go ahead.

349
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Do you remember that ghost guy?

350
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,060
He has a really high cultivation.

351
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
He can be called a good person

352
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
with a legendary talisman.

353
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
And he lost his hair on his face and sword.

354
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
I can understand if he lost his hair on his face.

355
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
He was recognized by others.

356
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
But he lost his hair on his sword.

357
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Ordinary people who don't see the golden hair

358
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
won't lose their hair on their sword.

359
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
Because there's no need for that.

360
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
Unless his sword is really famous

361
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
in the cultivation world.

362
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
As for the fact that if others recognize his sword,

363
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
it will be revealed.

364
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
So they have to be careful.

365
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
And

366
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
yesterday, I saw you and him

367
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
he seemed to know Lan's sword very well.

368
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Lan Zhan, think about it.

369
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Is he someone you know?

370
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Or

371
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,060
is he someone you know?

372
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
No.

373
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
You believe me?

374
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
You never lie to me.

375
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
If you say no,

376
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,060
then you must be lying.

377
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
But this matter

378
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
is getting more and more complicated.

379
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
But no matter what,

380
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,060
this person's death with Chi Feng will not be able to get rid of him.

381
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
Otherwise,

382
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,060
he won't come to take your money.

383
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
We have to go now.

384
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Yes.

385
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
So as not to be robbed.

386
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,060
But where are we going?

387
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,060
Shudu.

388
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,060
Shudu.

389
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Lan Zhan, are you sure

390
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,060
that your brother is pointing this way?

391
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Shudu.

392
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Shudu.

393
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,060
It's weird.

394
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,060
It doesn't look like someone is walking.

395
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Lan Zhan,

396
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,060
why don't you ask the villagers?

397
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Uncle, let me ask you.

398
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
What is the place that leads this way?

399
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
This way leads to Yicheng.

400
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,060
That place is very popular.

401
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
People living in this city

402
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
either have short life or short life.

403
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
They have been named after Yicheng.

404
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
Thank you, uncle.

405
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Take care.

406
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
Lan Zhan, let's go.

407
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,060
What did you ask?

408
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
That way leads to Yicheng.

409
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,060
The word on the stone cup is Yizi.

410
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
It's a Yizi word.

411
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
It's right.

412
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
It's not right.

413
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
What's the meaning?

414
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,060
The word is indeed Yizi.

415
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
It's not a Yizi word.

416
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
It's a Yizhuang word.

417
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
The boss said that

418
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
since ancient times,

419
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
people living in the city

420
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
have short life or short life.

421
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,060
Either they are short or they are dying.

422
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
There are many clothes

423
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
that are made of stone.

424
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Plus,

425
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,060
there are many things

426
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,060
that are made of clay.

427
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Whether it's made of clay or clay,

428
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
the memory is very good.

429
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
That's why they named it.

430
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Besides,

431
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
there are very few people in Yicheng.

432
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
There are few people

433
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
who come out of the city.

434
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
There are few people around.

435
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,060
This road has been abandoned for years.

436
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
No one has been there.

437
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
It's really hard to leave.

438
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Be careful.

439
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
The water is so bad.

440
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
The mountains are so bad.

441
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
Lan Zhan,

442
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,060
if someone is walking

443
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
in the middle of the road

444
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,060
while carrying the big things,

445
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm afraid we won't find it.

446
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Be careful.

447
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
It's a Scale Ben킷.

448
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,060
It must be the Surety Chang.

449
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Is it the Share Model of MingYin Miss?

450
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,060
Yes.

451
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
Saysільки.

452
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,780
Do you have ahorita?

453
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,220
Hendry?

454
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,220
What do you mean?

455
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,420
Are you in there?

456
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,740
Do you have him in there?

457
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,580
Will you say you were his sister,

458
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,420
and let your sister kill him?

459
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,500
What sister?

460
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,900
I caught a man with the arena board

461
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,100
and we had to come together.

462
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,380
Go outside with us now.

463
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,140
Do you want to take me to go for a fish?

464
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,300
Men usedric?

465
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,180
You need to make me run more than me.

466
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,780
You need to come right?

467
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,020
Don't tell me you're planning to come to Ye Lie together.

468
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,700
Why is it so strange?

469
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,580
There's no one?

470
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,140
The sun is bright and the monster is slow.

471
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,580
And there's no shop opening.

472
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,980
This isn't the point.

473
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,540
Tell me why you're here.

474
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,980
That's what I said.

475
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,060
After we entered,

476
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,380
the Wutai was so worried that we left.

477
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,700
We got together.

478
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,020
Suddenly, we heard this sound.

479
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,260
It wasn't that fast.

480
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,420
It was so slow.

481
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,980
In the white fog in the front,

482
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,300
the dragon saw a small shadow.

483
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,380
He slowly walked.

484
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,980
He disappeared when he was on the boat.

485
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,100
But the sound kept following us.

486
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,500
After we entered the city,

487
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,900
we were going along this road.

488
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,340
We never changed our direction.

489
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,540
But we couldn't get out of it.

490
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,620
Did you try to go up there to see it?

491
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,700
Yes.

492
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,620
I feel like we flew a long distance up there.

493
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,940
But we didn't get up too high.

494
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,780
And there were some

495
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,820
dark shadows in the air.

496
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,100
I don't know what it is.

497
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,460
I was worried that I couldn't get out.

498
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,780
So I came down.

499
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,260
Is there a poison in this?

500
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,780
No.

501
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,900
We've been here for a long time.

502
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,700
But we didn't die.

503
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,660
I knew it.

504
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,220
I brought the fairy here.

505
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,140
It's all your fault.

506
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,660
We didn't blame your dog.

507
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,300
He was biting first.

508
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
He kicked a pig with a small apple.

509
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,500
Who's fault is it?

510
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,660
Anyway, there are two now.

511
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,780
We can't get any.

512
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,500
Wait.

513
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,020
My apple was bitten?

514
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,300
Can the donkey compare to my fairy?

515
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,100
My uncle gave me the fairy.

516
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,700
If anything happens to her,

517
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,180
I can't afford to pay 10,000 yuan.

518
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,740
Fine.

519
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,900
Don't be so cheeky.

520
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,860
My apple

521
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,300
is the one Han Guangjun gave me.

522
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,940
How can you bring the apple

523
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,780
down the mountain?

524
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,940
You're lying.

525
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,540
Han Guangjun won't give you this.

526
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,900
Sorry, Mr. Mo.

527
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,340
Your apple...

528
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,420
donkey...

529
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,780
is not aware of the beauty of the world.

530
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,660
You've been a monk for a long time.

531
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,100
You want to drive him away

532
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,340
from the mountain.

533
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,740
So we...

534
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,380
I hate that donkey.

535
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,020
What's the name of the apple?

536
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,980
Idiot.

537
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,540
What's the matter with the apple?

538
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
It's called apple if you like it.

539
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,500
It's so common.

540
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,180
It's called the good 18-stringed fairy

541
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,660
than the dog you raised.

542
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,220
What's the problem?

543
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,780
Try a more advanced spiritual power.

544
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,140
Why didn't you say anything?

545
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,020
rophy.

546
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,760
There is absolutely the one in the digital hole!

547
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,280
How come?!

548
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,020
It's not the digital hole I'm in control of!

549
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,180
I can't be taken into what I control.

550
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,200
Seems like what I thought before is right.

551
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,380
Some put out the digital hole...

552
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,420
but it's just half.

553
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
utch isn't that big

554
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,900
What's wrong with you two?

555
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
These powder is mixed in the room.

556
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,180
It's bitter and sweet.

557
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
It's so disgusting.

558
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,780
Let's leave here first.

559
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,980
But we can't see anything.

560
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,100
Where are we going?

561
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,780
I don't like you.

562
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,360
Take some of my fök distract!

563
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,480
Are you trying to grab my準 Left-Japan環 crane?

564
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,160
But it's not your place!

565
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,740
Why did you leave me here?

566
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,060
Lan Zhan!

567
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,240
A pretend spirit is coming again!

568
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,380
If you don't aren't one hundred budget money

569
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,140
it's still owe you

570
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,620
death you sew

571
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,920
no longer

572
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,500
ah

573
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:22,400
it the

574
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,100
right

575
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,000
Alright

576
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,500
I'll studio you

577
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,560
Ok

578
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,560
How are the people invincible?

579
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,540
They're surprised

580
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,760
Please move the initiative

581
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,460
Huh

582
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,820
Huh

583
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,800
No one 110sки

584
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,020
Congratulations

585
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,520
You got Sith

586
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,920
What good luck?

587
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,680
It's a kind of old-fashioned talk.

588
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,080
It's a life-long story.

589
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
Mr. Mo,

590
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,360
will they be okay?

591
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,680
They won't be okay now.

592
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,880
But

593
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,680
if they get poisoned and get into the blood,

594
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
they'll be completely fine.

595
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,280
They'll be heartbroken.

596
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,280
Then they won't be saved.

597
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,720
What will happen?

598
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,200
What will happen to the dead?

599
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,600
What will happen to them?

600
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,720
What will happen?

601
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,000
What will happen?

602
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,440
They all want to die, right?

603
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,760
Okay.

604
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
Then listen carefully.

605
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,360
From now on,

606
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,360
everyone will listen to me.

607
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,240
Everyone will listen.

608
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,360
Okay.

609
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,000
Okay.

610
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,160
Stand up.

611
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,240
Those who aren't poisoned

612
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
and those who are poisoned will die.

613
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
If they're on the stage,

614
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,560
remember to raise your head and heart.

615
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,440
If I can,

616
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,520
why should I?

617
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,040
Little brother,

618
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,800
if you jump around,

619
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,160
the blood flow will be faster.

620
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
It will also speed up the speed of your heart.

621
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,040
So,

622
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
you must be careful.

623
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,320
Understand?

624
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,200
Yes.

625
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,200
Let's go.

626
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,600
Mr. Mo, where are we going?

627
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,080
We can't go out.

628
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,880
Let's go knock on the door.

629
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
You want us to go into the room?

630
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,800
It's already like this outside.

631
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,560
If there's anything hidden in the room,

632
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,800
what will we do?

633
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,080
That's right.

634
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,040
It's hard to say that it's more dangerous outside

635
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,640
or more dangerous inside.

636
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,840
But it's already like this outside.

637
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,120
If it's in the room,

638
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
it won't be able to go anywhere.

639
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,800
Let's go.

640
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,840
We have to detoxify

641
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,840
if we don't have enough time.

642
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,240
Let's go.

643
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,200
There's no one in this room. Come here.

644
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,800
Who told you to look for someone?

645
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Look for someone.

646
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,840
Keep looking.

647
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,000
You're a fool.

648
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,120
Is anyone there?

649
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,640
Excuse me. Is anyone there?

650
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,440
Someone's here.

651
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,960
Are you the owner?

652
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,480
Yes.

653
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,160
Mr. Mo, we're here.

654
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,840
The room is too big.

655
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,000
We're a bit lost.

656
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,720
We've been walking for a long time.

657
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,960
I don't know if we can borrow your place.

658
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
Let's take a break.

659
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
My place

660
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,440
is not for people to take a break.

661
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,240
But, Mr. Mo,

662
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,840
no one is in this room

663
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,040
or in any other room.

664
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,040
Can you really

665
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,880
let us in?

666
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,560
He...

667
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,320
He really wants us in?

668
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,640
Nonsense.

669
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm stuck here.

670
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,640
He can't even close his eyes.

671
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,400
If we don't let him in,

672
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,160
I'll break the door.

673
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,600
Mr. Mo, why didn't you turn on the light?

674
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
I'm waiting on the table.

675
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,840
I'll light it myself.

676
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Most welcome.

677
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,360
Your will is

678
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,500
All of them replaced by your hands?

679
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,040
Good skills

680
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:22,760
Mom.

681
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,560
It must have a八 Drucker.

682
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,840
Hey!

683
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,600
You aren't crazy.

684
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,680
Who would say I am?

685
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,000
Why should I wear a mask?

686
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,640
It shouldn't be Jerusalem.

687
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,480
You can study more and don't heal.

688
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Why didn't you turn on the light?

689
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I'll do it.

690
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Granny,

691
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I wonder if I can borrow the kitchen.

692
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,720
The kitchen is behind.

693
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,720
You can use it yourself.

694
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Thank you.

695
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Don't go in.

696
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
There's no danger inside.

697
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
But this place is full of ghosts.

698
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,720
We'd better stay in a good place.

699
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
I need someone to help.

700
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
Who do you want to come?

701
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
I'm not sure.

702
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
I'm just going to go inside.

703
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
I'm going to go inside.

704
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I'm going to go inside.

705
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Who do you want to come?

706
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I'm going to go inside.

707
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I'm going to go inside.

708
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,720
I'm going to go inside.

709
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
I'm going to go inside.
