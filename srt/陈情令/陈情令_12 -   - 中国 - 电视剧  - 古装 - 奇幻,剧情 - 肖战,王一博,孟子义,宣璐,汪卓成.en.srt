1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 12

3
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
Since you guys are here in Qishan,

4
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
you shall follow Qishan's rules.

5
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
First and foremost,

6
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,040
during indoctrination,

7
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
no one is allowed to carry weapons personally,

8
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
in case of disturbing His Excellency.

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,320
Now let us start.

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,320
Hand in your swords one by one.

11
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,840
A cultivator stands with his sword, always!

12
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
No way should we surrender our swords.

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
I must refuse!

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,720
Never before have we heard that we have to surrender our swords.

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,520
How can the Wens be such slippery?

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,560
We must refuse.

17
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,240
Who was speaking?

18
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
From which clan?

19
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,160
Stand out from the crowd.

20
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,570
It is exactly because of disciples like you,

21
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,360
who know nothing about obedience and etiquette,

22
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,560
whose cores are totally and utterly rotten,

23
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
that His Excellency has decided to indoctrinate you.

24
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,560
If your manners

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
aren't correct early on,

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,680
some of you might attempt to

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,960
challenge the authority

28
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,240
and tread upon our Wen clan's head.

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
Confiscate their swords!

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,160
Why are you restraining me?

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,280
I fear that you will make trouble.

32
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Relax,

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
though I am disguested by Wen Chao,

34
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,320
I am not gonna bring any trouble

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
to our family during this time.

36
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,800
Here you go.

37
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,160
Lan Zhan.

38
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,640
Here, here, here.

39
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
Our Jins stand with our swords.

40
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,000
If you want our swords, you will have to take us with you.

41
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,080
You dare to challenge His Excellency?

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,360
Childe Wen,

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,120
we are here to be indoctrinated.

44
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,400
Do not push it too far.

45
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,640
See, what was I talking about?

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,480
Some of you already have bad intentions.

47
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
Am I right?

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Second Childe Lan,

49
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,760
some of you, not just Lan clan of Gusu,

50
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,080
are trying to stage a coup.

51
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,400
You are one of the rebels!

52
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Soldiers, take him into custody.

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,320
Childe Wen.

54
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,600
Please pardon him for this matter.

55
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,640
It is Jin clan's family precept.

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
Our Childe

57
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
has no intention to offend you.

58
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
I beg for your

59
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,360
forgiveness.

60
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Mianmian, no need to beg for forgiveness.

61
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,000
There is no wimp in our Jin's clan.

62
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,960
You do look pretty.

63
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
What is your name?

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
Childe Wen,

65
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Wen clan and Jin clan have always been close.

66
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,640
On our departure, our clan leader

67
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,960
has instructed us to not

68
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,400
neglect Wen's commandments, decrees, and statutes.

69
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,880
Alright.

70
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,360
For your sake,

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
I will pardon your childe this time.

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
Soldiers, take his sword.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,960
My Childe,

74
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,520
have you forgot our clan leader's exhortation?

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
For the greater good,

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
just endure it for a little while.

77
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
Please don't make it difficult for our clan leader.

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,400
Are you gonna surrender your sword or not?

79
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,040
I will spare you this time,

80
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
for the sake of Jin's old clan leader.

81
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
But let me be clear,

82
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
if anyone of you dare to disobey my orders ever again,

83
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,800
I will show no mercy.

84
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,560
Here is a book for everyone,

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,240
"The Quintessence of Wens".

86
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,080
It is a collection of proverbs and glories

87
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,920
from clan leaders and famed gentries of Wen.

88
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,320
Every one of you needs to memorize

89
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,200
each word by heart.

90
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I will ask someone to recite

91
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,400
every sunrise, midday, and dusk from now on.

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Those who cannot,

93
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
will be punished according to our family rules.

94
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,760
Are you gonna do it or not?

95
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,400
Yes, most definitely.

96
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,520
And I am gonna take a hard look

97
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,760
to see how sickly Wen clan of Qishan can be.

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
Sis,

99
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,840
you are back.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
Ning,

101
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
how have you been these days?

102
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,440
I am alright.

103
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,080
Just a little bored.

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,960
I'm glad you are back.

105
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,640
By the way, Sis,

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,360
I heard that Uncle Wen

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
summoned disciples from each clan

108
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
to come to Qishan to be indoctrinated.

109
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,910
Do you think Childe Wei and his fellows are gonna be here?

110
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,520
This is my last warning.

111
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,960
If it ever happens again,

112
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,720
the one standing here is gonna be Wen Ning.

113
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Ning,

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,680
you need to remember,

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,680
we are not the same kind of people as Wei Wuxian.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
We are never gonna be friends with them.

117
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
Even if they are here in Qishan,

118
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,360
you'd better have nothing to do with him.

119
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,240
But why?

120
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
You don't need to know.

121
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,640
All in all,

122
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,000
stay away from them.

123
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
But Sis,

124
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,600
Childe Wei is a nice person.

125
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,840
He saved my life.

126
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,040
Ning!

127
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,280
Sis...

128
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,880
Are you not listening to your sister anymore?!

129
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
Well, this is some proverb

130
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,400
I did not expect coming from the Wens.

131
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,320
What did it say?

132
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
Here, let me read it for you.

133
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Those who count on their clan

134
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,800
and do evil at will

135
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,440
shall all be executed.

136
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
Not only to be executed,

137
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,800
but also decapitated

138
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
and reviled by the people

139
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
to warn the future generations.

140
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,680
If that is the case,

141
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,240
decapitated heads in Qishan are gonna

142
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,520
outnumber pig's heads.

143
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
It seems like, thick-skin is

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
the Wen's true heirloom.

145
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
I agree with that.

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,760
Jiang Cheng,

147
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,160
what do you have in mind?

148
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
Nothing.

149
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,160
Wen Qing...

150
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,600
Where do you think she is right now?

151
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,440
She should be here at Nevernight...

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,520
Not sure if we will be able to meet with her.

153
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,000
The Wens are so petty...

154
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
Something is not right.

155
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,280
The Wens are so petty.

156
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,960
How come they only took Lan Zhan for the indoctrination?

157
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,200
Something bad happened!

158
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,680
Hey you!

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
Per Second Childe's command,

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,800
wandering is not allowed during indoctrination.

161
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
I am just looking for someone.

162
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,840
Talking is not allowed neither.

163
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,040
Are we being treated as human or farm animals?!

164
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,520
I need to find a window tomorrow...

165
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Boys and girls,

166
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,600
have you all memorized "The Quintessence of Wens"?

167
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Do we have a volunteer?

168
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Alright.

169
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,080
Since there is no volunteer,

170
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
I will start calling people out.

171
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,920
Lan Wangji,

172
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,640
Wei Wuxian,

173
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,040
Jin Zixuan,

174
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,760
No, I cannot.

175
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,600
Aren't you one of ...

176
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
so-called Jade Twin of Lan?

177
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
How come you cannot even memorize a few words?

178
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
You are not taking our Wen clan seriously.

179
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,160
Alright.

180
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,560
Wei Wuxian, Jin Zixuan, you two go first.

181
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,360
I cannot neither.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
I will go first. I can do it.

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
Wei Wuxian,

184
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,600
you'd better do it right.

185
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
If not,

186
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,360
you will be punished.

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,560
Wei Wuxian,

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
are you gonna do it or not?

189
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,520
Yes, I will.

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,920
What is the hurry?

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,040
I am gonna get started now.

192
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Listen carefully.

193
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,080
Thou shall not kill,

194
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,760
fight,

195
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
or lech.

196
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,720
Thou shall not shout, wander at night, or sprint.

197
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,160
Thou shall not bully the weak by being strong or tease others.

198
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,960
Thou shall not breach laws.

199
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,880
This Bro Wei,

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,800
has some nerve.

201
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,600
Thou shall not skip class, or leave early.

202
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,240
Thou shall not sneer. Thou shall not sit improperly.

203
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,160
Shut up.

204
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,320
Wei Wuxian.

205
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,200
How dare you read out loud Lan's principles here in Qishan?!

206
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,640
Do you have a death wish?

207
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,280
Is that right?

208
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,440
What a fool.

209
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
I got it wrong. I apologize.

210
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,520
I will try again.

211
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,200
Here you go.

212
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,280
Shut up!

213
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,520
You think you can play me?

214
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
Soldiers,

215
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,320
take them to the vegetable garden

216
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
to carry the dung!

217
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Ah, carry the dung?

218
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Lan Zhan...

219
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,160
See,

220
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
isn't my way a good way?

221
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,880
Lan Zhan,

222
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,800
do you want me to find a scoop for you?

223
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,440
How come Lans only have silencing charm,

224
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,880
but not nose-blocking charm?

225
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,640
Be on my way.

226
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,200
Lan Zhan,

227
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,440
I heard

228
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,840
Wen Xu with some soldiers are on their way to Cloud Recesses

229
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,960
believing that Xue Yang's shard of Yin Iron

230
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,080
is in our hands.

231
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,160
If they weren't able to find the shard of Yin Iron,

232
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,360
did they cause any trouble to you?

233
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
Something bad happened, didn't?

234
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,920
Lan Zhan,

235
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,680
say something.

236
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,160
I knew you would not be doing your work.

237
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
What are you guys whispering about?

238
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Say it out loud.

239
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,880
Sure.

240
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,830
I was just telling Lan Zhan,

241
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,400
your vegetable garden smells really familiar.

242
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,680
And I was wondering,

243
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,520
what that smell is.

244
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,110
Once you approach,

245
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,760
it all came back to me.

246
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,440
What are you suggesting?

247
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,480
Isn't that the smell on you?

248
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,680
How dare you?!

249
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,680
Childe Wen,

250
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,040
do not try me.

251
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,080
Wen Chao!

252
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I am the one who called you out.

253
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,560
Come at me if you can.

254
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,000
It will be your term soon.

255
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
Wen Chao, do not cross the line.

256
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,120
Aw, I am so scared.

257
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,160
Put him down.

258
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,160
Wei Wuxian,

259
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,520
let's have a talk.

260
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
The chances are, you wanna ask Lan Wangji

261
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,840
the whereabouts of Yin Iron. Am I right?

262
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,800
He is here in Qishan Nevernight in person.

263
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,600
What further questions do you have?

264
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,320
You were on the right track.

265
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
We Wen clan have three shards of Yin Iron.

266
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,560
Thanks to the gentleman next to you.

267
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
Second Childe Lan.

268
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
A wise man submits to circumstances.

269
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
There is only one shard missing,

270
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,400
if that bastard Xu Yang did not take it,

271
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,880
it must be you who hid it.

272
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
Wei Wuxian,

273
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,320
Lan Wangji has no idea where the shard was hidden.

274
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,880
Cannot say the same thing about you.

275
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,960
Wen Chao, stop babbling.

276
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
We Wen clan of Qishan

277
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
would never make someone wronged.

278
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,760
As to whether you have the shard of Yin Iron

279
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,560
we have plenty of time to find out.

280
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Soldiers,

281
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,040
take him into the dungeon.

282
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,640
What's the matter?

283
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,040
Does Second Childe Lan wanna join him?

284
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,680
Our Wen's dungeon is quite spacious.

285
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,240
Childe Wen,

286
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,520
a dungeon is warm in winter and cool in summer.

287
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,400
That's most welcome for me.

288
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,880
Let's see how tough you can be.

289
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,320
Take him!

290
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,920
Ning.

291
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Sis.

292
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
What are you doing here?

293
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,320
Hmmm....

294
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,040
I...

295
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,560
Haven't I told you already,

296
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,200
to stay out of trouble.

297
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,960
Let's go.

298
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,280
Yes.

299
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Hey, you have prepared a suite for me. Nice.

300
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,680
There is something unique about this room.

301
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,920
You will see, once you are there.

302
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
Childe Wen, how nice of you.

303
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,360
Are you scared?

304
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,360
Our Childe Wei got scared.

305
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,360
Wei Wuxian, tell me something.

306
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,360
If you stay with him in this room,

307
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,360
do you think you can make it to sunrise?

308
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
Open the door!

309
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,840
Open the door!!

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
Wei Wuxian,

311
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,320
if you can survive the night,

312
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,920
I will let you off the hook.

313
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,000
If you die here,

314
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,520
well then, you have no one to blame

315
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,920
but yourself being a smart-ass.

316
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
Just stay here.

317
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
And enjoy your long night with him.

318
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
Wen Chao!

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,000
Open the door!

320
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,560
Get back.

321
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,120
Where did you take Wei Wuxian?

322
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,440
Do not ask what do not concern you.

323
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
And do not bring me trouble.

324
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Stop.

325
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,080
You are excused.

326
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,040
Where is Wei Wuxian?

327
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,960
Isn't he back yet?

328
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
Wasn't he taken by Wen Chao?

329
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,520
Miss Wen.

330
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,360
Miss Wen...

331
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,920
Did Wen Ruohan go hard with you?

332
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
I will try my best.

333
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
Bufotoxin Needle.

334
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,280
Wen Qing.

335
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Childe Wei.

336
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,520
Childe Wei.

337
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Wen Ning.

338
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,840
Childe Wei, how is your wound?

339
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,320
Oh, I almost forgot.

340
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,880
I brought you some medicine.

341
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,640
This is Natural Energy Booster.

342
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,640
It can help you to stabilize your energy, and enhance your core.

343
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,280
And here,

344
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
This can help stop bleeding.

345
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,280
It is for external use only.

346
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,560
Let's leave these aside.

347
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
How are you and your sister?

348
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,640
My sis is fine. No need to worry.

349
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,720
However,

350
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,200
ever since Wen Chao brought her back,

351
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,960
she was indeed reprimanded by Uncle Wen.

352
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,640
Because of me and Lan Zhan.

353
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,080
I am not sure what Uncle Wen said to her.

354
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Anyhow,

355
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,960
she has been acting weird

356
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,760
ever since she got back from Hellfire Hall.

357
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,040
And she told me...

358
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
told me that...

359
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,920
Stay away from Lan Zhan and me.

360
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,200
Was it really necessary?

361
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Dealing with everything herself alone.

362
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,320
Bro Wen,

363
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,080
thanks a lot.

364
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,400
Childe Wei,

365
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,280
there is no need to thank me.

366
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,000
I feel terribly sorry

367
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,560
for the things they have done,

368
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,320
especially for what happened to

369
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Cloud Recesses.

370
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,320
What happened to Cloud Recesses?

371
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,600
Did you not know?

372
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,160
When Wen Xu got back from Cloud Recesses,

373
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,040
he announced that he has

374
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,160
cleaned the house for the Lans, and that place is renewed.

375
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I have also heard,

376
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,000
he lit fire,

377
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
and burnt down half of Cloud Recesses.

378
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,040
A nirvana for hundreds of years

379
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,240
is ruined just like that.

380
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
Lan Zhan... his wound?

381
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,520
Because the last shard of Yin Iron was nowhere to be found,

382
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,880
Second Childe Lan was

383
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,800
brutally beaten and his leg was broken by Wen Xu.

384
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
That is outrageous!

385
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,200
Childe Wei, please calm down.

386
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
Be careful of your wounds.

387
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,200
I cannot stay long.

388
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,680
My sis will find out.

389
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Take the medicine.

390
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,280
Bro Wen,

391
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,560
no words can express my gratitude.

392
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,760
Take care.

393
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,400
I should save this medicine for Lan Zhan.

394
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,440
Wei Wuxian,

395
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,200
are you still breathing?

396
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,800
With how many legs left?

397
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,680
How did our little cute

398
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,840
perform last night?

399
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,520
Cannot even take the meat within reach.

400
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,760
Guess we fed you too full.

401
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,800
You piece of junk.

402
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,880
Wen Chao,

403
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,040
What kind of hero you are, letting a beast fight your fight.

404
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,600
If you have a spine, combat one-on-one with me.

405
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,040
Hush.

406
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,680
Take it easy.

407
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,960
Today is your lucky day.

408
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,280
We have plenty of time together.

409
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,320
Let's go.

410
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,520
Let's go.

411
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Wei Wuxian.

412
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,800
Morning. Guys.

413
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,200
What happened?

414
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,440
What did they do to you?

415
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,120
This is something you do not understand.

416
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,160
These are my glorious...

417
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,760
glorious record.

418
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,440
What?

419
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,600
Miss me already?

420
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,560
Yeah, you wish!

421
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
I think you have not had it enough.

422
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,560
You have not learned your lesson.

423
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,320
Please, please, please.

424
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,320
Place like that, once is enough.

425
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,280
Bro Nie,

426
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,920
do you have anything to eat?

427
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,880
Something like osmanthus cake,

428
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,520
or rose crispy.

429
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,480
I was held in that damned place all day

430
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,400
without food.

431
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,320
I am starving.

432
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,880
Osmanthus cake? You're kidding...

433
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,240
You think we are still attending the lecture at Lan clan?

434
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,080
There is no osmanthus cake,

435
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,280
but steamed buns.

436
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,640
You will have to make do.

437
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,600
Yum.

438
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,440
Here comes Second Childe Wen.

439
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,440
Miss Wen.

440
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,520
Before today's indoctrination begins,

441
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,520
I have a few announcements.

442
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
First of all,

443
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,640
you guys have probably heard,

444
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,040
from now on Cloud Recesses is under Qishan's control.

445
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,440
And secondly,

446
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,600
Nie clan of Qinghe,

447
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,440
which was insubordinate to our instructions

448
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,280
showing the lack of discipline

449
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,160
is deemed irreverence.

450
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,280
His Excellency has ordered a crackdown.

451
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
What happened to my big brother then?

452
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,080
A hot-head putting up a desperate fight,

453
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
what do you expect?

454
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
And then,

455
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,360
there is Jin clan of Lanling...

456
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,960
Wen Chao, I dare you?!

457
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,040
Childe Jin,

458
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,480
let me finish my sentence.

459
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,080
Jin clan has been cooperative.

460
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,600
As long as you do not stir up trouble,

461
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,840
I will guarantee your parents' safety.

462
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
Alright.

463
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,720
Now, only one left in the main five clans is Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

464
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,840
It is a shame that Jiang Fengmian is such a coward,

465
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,240
hiding away in Yumeng.

466
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,360
Wen Chao!

467
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,280
You better suck it up.

468
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,150
I can hardly wait

469
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,670
to visit Lotus Cove myself right now.

470
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,800
Sis, you are back.

471
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,880
Come and have a seat.

472
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,760
Sis,

473
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,120
have you seen Childe Wei and his fellows today

474
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,800
at indoctrination bureau?

475
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,480
How are they?

476
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,400
Ning,

477
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,440
why are you bringing them up again?

478
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,240
Had my words

479
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
fallen on deaf ears?

480
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
Let me ask you something.

481
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,440
Where did the Natural Energy Booster in my dispensary go?

482
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,240
You weren't in your room last night.

483
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,400
Where did you go?

484
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,960
Do you seriously think I am clueless?

485
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,320
If you do not behave,

486
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,920
you will no longer be allowed to go outside.

487
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,920
Just stay in this room then.

488
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,880
Sis,

489
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,920
wasn't you the one who taught me

490
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,640
that our Wen's principles

491
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,960
tell us to always pay back to kindness.

492
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,960
Childe Wei...

493
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
he is my savior. I owe it to him.

494
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,360
Ning,

495
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,720
you are my family by blood.

496
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,080
All I have left in our family is you.

497
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,880
Do you understand?

498
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,200
"The Quintessence of Wens".

499
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,720
Qishan Wen's progenitor,

500
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,480
Wen Mao, was

501
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,120
the first that emphasized the prosperity of a clan rather a section.

502
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,240
Those who count on their clan and do evil at will

503
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,760
shall all be executed.

504
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,480
Stand still.

505
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Shall all be executed.

506
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,920
Not only to be executed,

507
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,960
but also decapitated and reviled by the people.

508
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,280
And reviled by the people.

509
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,840
To warn the future generations.

510
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,800
Loser.

511
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,240
Take him out.

512
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,440
Childe,

513
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,360
Mount Muxi?

514
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,880
What's the matter?

515
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,920
We just got the news,

516
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,520
there are some bizarre events in Mount Muxi.

517
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,440
Quite unusual.

518
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,080
The place is a gathering ground for monsters.

519
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,720
Ordinary people cannot enter.

520
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,320
It is considered dangerous even for cultivators.

521
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,120
Hence,

522
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
we suspect that there must be evil monsters.

523
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,880
However,

524
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,920
the people we sent out to repress it

525
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,240
barely survived.

526
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
So we report our suspicion to you, my Childe.

527
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,680
Sounds like I will need to attend to the matter by myself.

528
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,080
My Childe, that place is really creepy.

529
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,720
Should we report it to His Excellency?

530
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,120
For what!?

531
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,520
With these many human shields,

532
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,720
are you afraid that we won't make it out unscathed?

533
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,880
Brilliant, my Childe.

534
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,480
What?

535
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,440
Come on.

536
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,720
=Wang Lingjiao from Wen clan of Qishan.

537
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,520
Joint night hunting?

538
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,160
In my opinion, we are the suicide squad paving the way for him.

539
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,280
We surrendered our swords.

540
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,040
How are we gonna defend ourselves

541
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,480
if we run into some demonic creatures?

542
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
Be quiet.

543
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,640
Leave them alone.

544
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,880
They are shameless.

545
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,040
Look at him.

546
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
What a disgrace.

547
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,440
Have you ever heard the saying?

548
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,440
A whore with a troll, everlasting couple.

549
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
I suppose this is what it means.

550
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,280
Where do you hear some slang like it from?

551
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,040
Doesn't matter.

552
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,800
It just suits here.

553
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,480
What do you wanna do now?

554
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,480
Go help him again?

555
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,600
Do not be so reckless.

556
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,680
Did not I tell you already

557
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,920
what happened to the Lans?

558
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,640
Take a look at his leg.

559
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,200
These days we have been running around,

560
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,080
his injury must have aggravated.

561
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,760
If I do not help him,

562
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,080
he is gonna lose his leg.

563
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,280
That is enough, Wei Wuxian.

564
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,600
You have helped him enough.

565
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,680
He is probably not gonna

566
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,920
let you get close to him

567
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
not to mention carrying him.

568
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,480
What he thinks is his business.

569
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,760
What I do is my business.

570
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,840
Besides,

571
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,720
he is not gonna choke me to death

572
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,080
if I grab him and carry him on my back.

573
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,400
It is hard enough to take care after ourselves.

574
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,240
We do not have the energy to deal with someone else's trouble.

575
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,240
First of all, it is not something trivial.

576
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,280
And secondly,

577
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,840
somebody should cope with the situation.

578
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,760
Lan Zhan,

579
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,480
how is your leg?

580
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,080
Fine.

581
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,680
Lan Zhan,

582
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,160
After all we've been through together,

583
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,640
is there anything you can't share?

584
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,760
Your leg is OK for sure?

585
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,840
Fine.

586
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,840
Don't pretend it's fine in every case.

587
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,080
How about

588
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,600
let me carry you?
