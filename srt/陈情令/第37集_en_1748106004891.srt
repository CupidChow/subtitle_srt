1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I thought it was a black cat.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I thought it was a black cat.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 13

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We better not go in.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There is no danger in it.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But this place is full of ghost.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On other people's floor, we'd better stay close.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I need someone to help. Who do you want to come?

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mr. Mo, let me do it.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What should I do?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You. I didn't let you move. You definitely can't move.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you hear me?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's go.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What the hell? You don't want to help me? What are you doing here?

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How do you know I'm asking you to help?

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not here to help.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I just forgot to hide it. Why are you so mean?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Miss Jin, you come here and help.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you don't come, just go back and do your thing.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Someone else will come to help.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who is Miss Jin? You better be careful.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to see what you're doing.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fine. Si Zui, go and get me some water.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why do you need to wash the table?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're not going to cook.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to cook.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Go and clean the ashes.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Clean the plants and plants.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hurry up.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to get some water.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're cooking porridge?

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's so good about porridge?

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a soup.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't give you any anyway.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What did you say?

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've been watching you for so long. You haven't had my rice yet.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Senior Mo, can you detoxify the porridge?

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Si Zui is smart.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But it's not porridge. It's rice.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a soil.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No wonder you have to go into the house.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And there's a house with someone.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There's a kitchen where someone lives.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's rice in the kitchen.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Right?

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're right.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come on.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You haven't said how you came to Yicheng.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What a coincidence.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You just met us on the way.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I, the people from the Lan family,

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and the other family members,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
came here for one thing.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I came here from Qinghe.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We came here from Langya.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is it?

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He didn't show up.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We don't know what he is.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Who is he?

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What kind of organization is he?

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Who is it?

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who is it?

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who is it?

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Who is it?

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who is it?

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who is it?

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's it.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've been in the inn for several days.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So I went out of the inn.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I heard a cat that appeared in a unknown place.

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I went there to see

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
who was the one who was the ghost.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What about you?

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We were there too.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We chased Yueyang along the way.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We met Mr. Jin.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We found that we were in the same room

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and were acting together.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We chased this generation today.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We asked a hunter in a ten-packed village

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and we were pointed at Yicheng's way.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A hunter?

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When I came with Lan Zhan this morning,

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the village was clearly a common tiger.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Where did the hunter come from?

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Although the behavior of the cat was abandoned,

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it looked scary when it was heard.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But they were not hurt.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
These things

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
caused their curiosity and desire.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The location they met

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
was also the Yueyang that I and Lan Zhan were in.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It seems that someone

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
deliberately wanted to bring them

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to meet Lan Zhan and me.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is not the best.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It was the person who was in the Yinghu Manor.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Maybe he is in Yicheng now.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sister Mo,

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the porridge seems to be cooked.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Just take it out.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The poisonous people are one person at a time.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's feed them.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Jin Ling.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What are you doing?

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Be careful.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll feed you.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is this?

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Is it poison?

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What poison?

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is antidote, glutinous rice porridge.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter what, why would glutinous rice porridge be antidote?

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've never had such a spicy glutinous rice porridge.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mo Fei said

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to sprinkle the chili powder on it.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then it is them convinced in comparison

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when eating them with egg.]

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This smell

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
actually feels a little

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
familiar.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It is Diamond Poison.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can get a cold rare,

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but you are getting better after it.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Dude!

137
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,780
Wait wait wait wait!

138
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,220
Are you置 bye cigarettes?

139
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,460
I'm tired.

140
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,000
What've you seen?

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
What's in the door?

142
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,280
I saw it when I was talking.

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Wow, that's awesome!

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wow, awesome!

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Get up!

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What's wrong?

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong?

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
How is it?

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Is it pretty?

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, it's not that bad.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can see it from the outside.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's wrong?

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What's wrong?

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't say it.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There's no surprise.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go see it.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I was trying to trick you.

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You were tricking me.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't ask for your uncle's permission.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Sijui, is that thing scary?

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Scary?

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Then you can have a look.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is a good chance for you to practice.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You just have to look at it more carefully

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
because it's scary.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Tell me what it is.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How is it?

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What did you see?

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
White copper, female.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
She's very thin and thin.

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She's good looking.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
She's got a bamboo stick.

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This girl is only 15 or 16 years old.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
She has a lot of face and is very thin.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
She has a lot of energy.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She has a little fox head on her tail.

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She's thin and has a lot of body.

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
She's not very accurate.

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But she's not a dirty person.

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If I can get rid of her,

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
she must be a cute beauty.

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Not bad.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She's good looking and has a unique look.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
She must be a kind girl.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This girl is probably a bit aggressive.

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She's not very accurate in the medical field.

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She's like a girl who's playing with a dog.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That bamboo stick

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
seems to be a dirty person.

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
White copper

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is not because she's a monster.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's because she's a blind person.

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And she keeps using bamboo sticks to knock on the door.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She's like a person who can't say anything.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And her neck is black.

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's right.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
She has a lot of eyes.

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She's very careful.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hello?

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This girl has been following us.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is there something wrong?

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't speak.

204
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm so sorry.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Is that the ghost?

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No.

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The person's figure is completely different from that.

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What's going on?

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Mr. Meng, this person is poisoned.

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you mean?

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's poison in the room.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He must be poisoned.

214
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I...

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can't speak.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
His employing is so maintainable.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He has such a dignified and filial career.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He is in deep scuffle.

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The bulletinMüzikTON will strike him.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The differential Lambo?

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Take him to keep aside of the rest.

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll kill him.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't you come over.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Have you read the letter?

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If you Route 4 is near, you'll be poisoned too.

226
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you guys doing?

227
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Little Shi, I'm here.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Si Zui, hurry up and get the whole thing.

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hurry up!

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey, we don't know what he's like.

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He's a good guy. Why did he save him?

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What if he's a bad guy?

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Maybe he's just a snake.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What if he's a bad guy?

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What if he's a bad guy?

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Maybe he's just a snake.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But he might be a good guy.

238
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You didn't see him being destroyed outside.

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He must be a bad guy.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Besides, he's a good guy.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Fine, you're all good guys.

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't blame me if you die.

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Senior Mo.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shang Hua Jin.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Could he be...

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Xing Chen?

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What the hell?

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's a good guy.

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He's not a bad guy.

250
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What's the problem?

251
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know.

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's a few hundred.

253
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We can't keep the key.

254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Senior Mo, do you need the magic spell?

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I need two spells.

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How many blood do you need?

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,500
What?

258
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,000
It's mine!

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,500
It's mine!

260
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
You've been cultivating for years.

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Do you have any free-range talismans?

262
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You can paint it.

263
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Moon

264
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,700
Get out!

265
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
asten

266
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,700
Attack

267
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,200
Attack

268
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,700
Attack

269
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,200
Attack

270
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,500
Attack

271
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,540
Helping

272
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,020
Ah, man...

273
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Lock him up!

274
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
Song brother, Song Lan.

275
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Eighth snake?

276
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Oh my god, who would be so vicious?

277
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,540
What's wrong with you?

278
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Who's the one who repaired the coffin?

279
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,540
I, I repaired it.

280
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Did you bring money?

281
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
I did.

282
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
How did your Qin Yu get repaired?

283
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Did you take the time to take it?

284
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Will the spirit that you invited be lying?

285
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
The Qin Yu that Si Zhi mentioned,

286
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Lord Han said it's okay.

287
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Lord Han said that

288
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
I didn't repair much.

289
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,540
The spirit that I invited

290
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
can choose not to answer.

291
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
But I can't lie enough.

292
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,540
So, as long as he's willing to answer,

293
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
then what he said must be true.

294
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Let's start.

295
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
I'm sorry.

297
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
I'm sorry.

298
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
The first question.

302
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
What's his name?

303
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
What did he say?

304
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Song Lan.

305
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Okay.

306
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
It seems that your Qin Yu is well repaired.

307
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Answer the question.

308
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
Then ask him the second question.

309
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
Who is hurt?

310
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I don't know.

311
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,540
I...

312
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Impossible.

313
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
What did he say?

314
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
He said...

315
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Xiao Xing Chen.

316
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
You...

317
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
You must have miscalculated.

318
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
No.

319
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Who is hurt?

320
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
It's the easiest question.

321
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
It's also the most common.

322
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
When people start to rest,

323
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
the first and second sentences are them.

324
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
I practiced it a thousand times.

325
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
I confirmed it repeatedly.

326
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
I didn't make a mistake.

327
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
Either your question is miscalculated

328
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
or your Qin Yu is miscalculated.

329
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
Impossible.

330
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
If you're not sure,

331
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
you can just answer it.

332
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
It's impossible.

336
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
If you say you're wrong, it's impossible.

337
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,540
Then it's even more impossible to solve the mistake.

338
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Xiao Xing Chen and his name

339
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
are not common in the answer.

340
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,540
If he said it was another name,

341
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
and I solved it wrong,

342
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
it's impossible to make the mistake.

343
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,540
He said Song Lan was looking for Xiao Xing Chen.

344
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,540
But now he said that Xiao Xing Chen hurt him.

345
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Why did he hurt his good friend?

346
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,540
He doesn't look like this person.

347
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
Sijui.

348
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Ask him the third question.

349
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,540
Who did this?

350
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
Who did this?

351
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
I...

352
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I am the best person in the world.

353
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
Don't move!

354
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Don't come over here.

355
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Compared to the sword,

356
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,540
it's not the opponent of this Song Lan

357
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
who is the best person in the world.

358
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,540
You are talking to me.

359
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
You can leave now.

360
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
You can leave now.

361
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
You can't help here.

362
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
The dust outside should be dust.

363
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Don't run around.

364
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,540
Go out and take a deep breath.

365
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
What are you doing?

366
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
I can't.

367
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
Why are you taking a deep breath?

368
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
I am just taking a deep breath.

369
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,540
You can't help here.

370
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
You can't.

371
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
You can't.

372
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
You can't.

373
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
You can't.

374
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
You can't.

375
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,540
You can't.

376
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
You can't.

377
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,540
You can't.

378
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,260
Don't be afraid.

379
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,900
Really?

380
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,540
Mr. Mo,

381
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,380
you and Hanguang Jun really look alike.

382
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,580
They do?

383
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,700
How do we look alike?

384
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,220
Two people from the sky and the sky.

385
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
I don't know either,

386
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,260
but I feel like it.

387
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,020
As long as you are here,

388
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,660
don't worry about anything.

389
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,860
The poison powder?

390
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,860
Yes.

391
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,540
It's much more effective than the porridge you made, right?

392
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,180
And it's sweet.

393
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,620
The horse you made is so good.

394
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,420
The powder killer just now

395
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,940
was poisoned by the poison.

396
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,420
To show us,

397
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,740
you are so heartless.

398
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,900
It's not for you,

399
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,660
but for you.

400
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,060
I guess you haven't told them

401
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,900
who you are.

402
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,180
So I didn't tell you

403
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,700
to let them out.

404
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,060
We are here to talk.

405
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,220
How is it?

406
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,740
Is it a little bit too much?

407
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,260
So the kuei of Yicheng

408
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,660
is made by the Niu Yinghu.

409
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,060
When you came in

410
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,660
and tried to break the flute,

411
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,060
I found out

412
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,540
that I haven't seen the big things for so many years.

413
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,660
So I can only try.

414
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,660
Although Hanguang Jun is a little troublesome,

415
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,180
my friend

416
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,780
is still not sure

417
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
if he can make it in time.

418
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,500
Enough.

419
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,180
I don't have time to listen to you.

420
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,900
To be honest,

421
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,260
you treat those kids as hostage.

422
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,980
What do you want me to do?

423
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,340
I want you to help me.

424
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,420
A little bit.

425
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,620
Who is this spirit?

426
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,420
Even if it's broken,

427
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,300
it's hard to hold it.

428
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,460
If this spirit

429
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,020
can stand up so easily,

430
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,340
what can I do for you?

431
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,460
If you want me to repair this spirit stone,

432
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
I'm the one who's doing it.

433
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,300
There are too few of them here.

434
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,300
And if the spirit

435
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,780
can't save it

436
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,900
when it's not in the prison,

437
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,060
and I didn't guess it wrong,

438
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,380
this person must be dead.

439
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,580
Since he's dead,

440
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,220
how can I save him?

441
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,580
You don't know these questions?

442
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,980
I don't know. I don't care.

443
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,540
You're dead, aren't you?

444
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,420
You can revive him.

445
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,980
There must be a way.

446
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,860
Who told you that Wen Ning is dead?

447
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,780
He didn't die, did he?

448
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,660
Since you call me a senior,

449
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,460
I'll sell you to a good man.

450
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,780
The legend of the lake

451
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,780
is not a pity.

452
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,980
You have to help me.

453
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,060
Senior, don't forget.

454
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,900
The kids you brought

455
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
are waiting for you outside the door

456
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,940
to take them to the prison.

457
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,660
It's been years.

458
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,860
I'm so unlucky.

459
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,020
Xue Yang,

460
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,420
you're busy.

461
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,900
Why are you pretending to be someone else?

462
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,260
Why have people come in unexpectedly?

463
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,440
What is this?

464
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,860
I heard a scent coming from the 안� убий.

465
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,860
It can be harmful to people.

466
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,420
I may be in danger.

467
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,940
Don't think in so Damit amidst the haי.

468
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,300
This mist

469
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,680
that's in preparation for a

470
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,140
deal of hatred may be hurtful.

471
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,620
Orittle M pure

472
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,940
will give you mercy.

473
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,900
It's absolutely out of the question.

474
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,040
So I accept it.

475
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,480
I'm afraid you'll be careful

476
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,880
if you think we've done this before.

477
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
Who told her to be a good person

478
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,160
and I'm a bad person?

479
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,280
Of course, it's easier to get someone's trust

480
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,760
if you pretend to be her.

481
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,800
Good acting.

482
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Good acting.

483
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Where?

484
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,440
I have a friend.

485
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,680
That's called acting.

486
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm not as good as you.

487
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,440
Okay, stop talking nonsense.

488
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,400
Stop talking nonsense.

489
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,960
You're a member of the Yiling Clan.

490
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
You're a creator.

491
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,840
I respect your seniority.

492
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
You can't do this.

493
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,040
You controlled Song Lan and Wen Ning's black long nails, right?

494
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,520
Since you can make half of the Eagle Tiger's talisman,

495
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,320
you can repair a spirit stone.

496
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,680
Why do you need my help?

497
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,360
It's different.

498
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,480
You're a creator.

499
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,680
If you didn't make the Eagle Tiger's talisman,

500
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,080
I wouldn't be able to make half of the Eagle Tiger's talisman.

501
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,120
I didn't expect that you could use the Eagle Tiger's talisman

502
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,000
to make a treasure like that.

503
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,280
I just saw it.

504
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,120
So you hid the long nail.

505
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
I was wrong.

506
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,520
I did hide the eagle's talisman,

507
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,320
but not the long nail.

508
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
Oh?

509
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,720
How could the Yulian Clan have the Eagle's talisman?

510
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,880
You're so easy to fool.

511
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,840
I did hide the eagle's talisman,

512
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,000
but I did hide it before midnight.

513
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,040
No wonder we saw the eagle's talisman

514
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,440
when we were in the long city.

515
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
The eagle's talisman is a spiritual talisman.

516
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,920
People only know this,

517
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,400
but they don't know there's another one.

518
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,720
The four directions are the Xuanwu.

519
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,080
The path to Xuanwu.

520
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,680
So, Senior Wei, you're so lucky.

521
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,160
You actually found the last piece of the iron sword

522
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,840
that was sealed in the Wuyi Sect.

523
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,440
So you knew the truth about the Five-Style Iron?

524
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,920
You're really good.

525
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,320
You've been hiding the eagle's talisman for so many years.

526
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,160
It's not as good as a little seal.

527
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,880
Everyone thought I took away your eagle's talisman

528
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,480
and saved the Eagle's talisman.

529
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,800
It's not as good as a suicide.

530
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,960
No, no, no.

531
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
You're better than me.

532
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,880
I just found some secret of the eagle's talisman.

533
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,680
But you can't help but make the Eagle's talisman.

534
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,800
You're modest.

535
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,600
It's not modest.

536
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,520
It's the truth.

537
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,920
I never like to talk about it.

538
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,560
It's like I said I wanted to kill a whole family.

539
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,840
So it must be a whole family.

540
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,800
Even a dog.

541
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,320
I won't leave it to him.

542
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,440
For example, the Yangtze Mountain and Snow White.

543
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,360
Nuedal Needle, fire!

544
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,480
Wen Ning, fire!

545
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,320
Guess who will win.

546
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
Can't guess.

547
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
Of course, that's Wen Ning.

548
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,740
It's a pity that I've ordered so many chrysanthemum.

549
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,140
But she still doesn't want to listen.

550
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,640
Some things are too popular.

551
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,240
It's also very painful for people to complain.

552
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,440
Wonyu isn't a thing.

553
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,040
Didn't you find that this word is very meaningful?

554
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,540
Yes.

555
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,240
You often say things like that and you're just a little bit too lazy.

556
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,640
Of course. I'm just a little busy.

557
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,040
You're not the first person to know me.

558
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,840
I'm not trying to kill you.

559
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,440
I just want you to stay out of my way and go back with me.

560
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Then slowly repair this spirit stone.

561
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,840
Didn't I say I can't do anything about it?

562
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't be so hasty.

563
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,140
You can't do anything about it alone.

564
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,040
We can talk about it.

565
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,840
You're bullying me to lower my physical strength after I got hurt, right?

566
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
Yes.

567
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,440
This word is good.

568
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,640
You can offend good people and you can't keep them busy.

569
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,840
What you're saying is you.

570
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm not going to fight you.

571
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm going to change someone.

572
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,240
Who are you going to change?

573
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,840
I'm going to change someone.

574
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,340
Who are you going to change?

575
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,040
That Hanguang Jun?

576
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,840
That little friend of mine is pestering him.

577
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,440
Do you think this is called

578
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,640
a better chance than a sooner one?

579
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,640
Hanguang Jun, we meet again?

580
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Give me the sword!

581
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
You don't deserve this sword.

582
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
You're so bad.

583
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
This sword is really good for you.

584
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
Step back. You don't need to use it.

585
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
EEтер

586
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
my senior brother

587
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
senior brother mo

588
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Senior Mo!

589
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,840
It seems that there's no need for me here.

590
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Let's go.

591
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
It seems that there's no need for me here.

592
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Hmm.

593
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
How is it? Are you okay?

594
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
I'm fine.

595
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
I heard everything from you. You're breathing.

596
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,240
That's good. If anyone doesn't listen to me,

597
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I'll let you drink glutinous rice porridge again.

598
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
No, no, no.

599
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
It's a good idea.

600
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Of course.

601
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Of course, Han Guang Jun is good.

602
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
He just doesn't like to show off.

603
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
He's so low-key.

604
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Right?

605
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Are you asking me?

606
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Do you think Han Guang Jun is not good?

607
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Uh...

608
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
Yes, he is.

609
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Of course, he's good. He's the best.

610
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
He's good.

611
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
He's good.

612
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
He's good.

613
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
He's good.

614
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
He's so good. He's the best.

615
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Oh, no.

616
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
So many people are here.

617
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Once they're surrounded by a big group of ghosts,

618
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
they'll be safe and sound.

619
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Let's go.

620
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Where are we going?

621
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Follow the bamboo stick.

622
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
You want us to follow someone who doesn't know his identity?

623
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Who knows where he'll take us?

624
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Follow him.

625
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
From your start,

626
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
this sound has always been following you.

627
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
You want to go to the city.

628
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
He'll take you out of the city and meet us.

629
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
He's actually rushing you out.

630
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
He's rushing you out of the city.

631
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
He's rushing you out of the city.

632
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
He's rushing you out of the city.

633
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
He's rushing you out of the city.

634
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
He's rushing you out of the city.

635
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Lord Han.

636
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Hey.

637
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
We're leaving.

638
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
I'm leaving.

639
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Let's go.

640
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,240
He told us something urgent last night.

641
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
But he couldn't tell us.

642
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Xueyang disappeared.

643
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
He was hiding in the city.

644
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Xueyang and Xueyang were definitely not together.

645
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Xueyang?

646
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Xueyang who killed Changsheng?

647
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
He's not dead?

648
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Why is Xueyang dead?

649
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Isn't he the one who killed Xiao Xingchen?

650
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I'll explain later.

651
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Anyway,

652
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Lord Han didn't kill Xiao Xingchen.

653
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
He killed Xueyang.

654
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
They're all here.

655
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Go in.

656
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
This is the place where the dead are disguised as dead?

657
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
That's right.

658
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
The bodies of the missing people

659
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
will be stored here.

660
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Why did he bring us here?

661
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Will he be surrounded by the ghosts?

662
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Where did he go?

663
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
I'm afraid he really won't.

664
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,240
We've been here for so long.

665
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Has anyone heard of the ghosts?

666
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
No.

667
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I don't think so.

668
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Have you seen the ghost?

669
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
No.

670
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Mo Qianbei.

671
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
He seems to have asked us to open this coffin.

672
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
The coffin must be his family.

673
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
Don't come over.

674
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Stay away from him.

675
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
The body is not in the coffin.

676
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
It's poison.

677
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
He's going to spray you again.

678
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Xiao...

679
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Mo Qianbei.

680
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Don't worry.

681
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Mo Qianbei.

682
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Since you can't speak,

683
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
do you need to ask Ling?

684
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
No.

685
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
We may not be able to ask her

686
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
the questions she wants us to ask.

687
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
And I think

688
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,240
her answer is very complicated and difficult.

689
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
What should we do?

690
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Let's go.

691
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
No.

692
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
The imperial guards are here.

693
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
It's dangerous.

694
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
This kind of outside door is dangerous.

695
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
They might play with me.

696
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
They can't get in and out.

697
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
If there's no one...

698
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Okay, we don't have time.

699
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Stand up.

700
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Let's start.

701
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
We have to go back to the Han Guang Army after we finish.

702
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
The imperial guards are here.

703
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
They are here.

704
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
They are here.

705
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
They are here.

706
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,240
They are here.

707
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
They are here.

708
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
They are here.

709
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
They are here.

710
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
They are here.

711
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
They are here.

712
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
They are here.

713
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,240
They are here.

714
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
They are here.

715
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
They are here.

716
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
They are here.

717
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
They are here.

718
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
They are here.

719
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
They are here.

720
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
They are here.

721
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
They are here.

722
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
They are here.

723
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
They are here.

724
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
They are here.

725
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,240
They are here.

726
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,240
They are here.

727
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
They are here.

728
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
They are here.

729
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
They are here.

730
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
They are here.
