Wei Wuxian died!

8
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
Good that he died.

9
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,160
Such a good news!

10
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,280
Wei Wuxian, the Yiling Patriarch, couldn't have been killed

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
on the spot except for the coalition of

12
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,200
Jiang clan, Lan clan, Jin clan

13
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,600
and Nie clan

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,520
for he was such a terrible disaster.

15
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,200
Yeah.

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
Jiang clan adopted him out of mercy,

17
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,720
but he turned out to be a merciless devil.

18
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,000
Ungratefully,

19
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
he betrayed his clan

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,620
and rivaled against all clans.

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,920
If I were Jiang Cheng,

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,600
I'd have killed him in the beginning.

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
I got the Stygian Tiger Amulet!

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,360

Let go of me.

Jiang Cheng.

33
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,700

Go to hell!

37
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
As for Wei Wuxian,

38
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,120
sixteen years ago,

39
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
he was once

40
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,760
a prestigious young childe

41
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,800
who got famous when young.

42
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,920
How glorious he was.

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,560
But look at his ending.

44
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,360
Falling off the cliff

45
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
with no piece to be found

46
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,160
having no chance to survive.

47
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,280
Storyteller,

48
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,760

54

He did fall off.

55
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,680
However,

56
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
during the sixteen years,

57
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,440
the young clan leader Jiang Cheng didn't find his body

58
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,360
even though he searched every area at the bottom of the cliff.

59
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,370

Although we have gone through the sixteen years in peace,

66
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,200
who can say for sure that?

Wei Wuxian

68
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,080
won't come back

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,760
now?

It's you.

87
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,040
I saved you with all my heart.

88
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,920
From now on

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,400
You are the Mo Xuanyu.

90
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,760
No, I am not.

91
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,280
I am...

92
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,440
I had no choice.

93
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,560
I didn't want to use the spell to offer my body.

94
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,800
But

95
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,680
they are so excessive.

96
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,120

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480

take revenge for me!

100
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,320
Hurry up.

101
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,280
Hurry.

102
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,240
Who are you?

103
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,960
Get lost.

104
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,520
How dare you kick me?

105
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,720
How reckless.

106
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
You should have reported me!

107
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
But I don't care.

108

Can't I take some things from you?

Yours are mine!

116

All checked?

118
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
Have you got the cultivators' item?

119
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,320
These are all we found

120
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,800
in this shabby room.

Pieces of paper,

122
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,200
you hide them as treasure.

123
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
You really think you are somebody for your several years in Lanling?

124
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,520
They will never accept you. A bastard.

125
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
At last you were kicked out like a dog.

126
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,720
As your cousin,

127
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,400
I remind you.

128
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
Don't daydream

129
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
as your bitch mother.

130
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,280
Lowlife will stay low.

131
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,840
You won't be associated with that influential Jin clan.

132
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,640
Young master,

133
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,240
the cultivators for cleansing have arrived.

134
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,640
Madam calls on you.

135
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,480
Let's go.

136
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Mo Xuanyu.

137
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,960
I have already died.

138
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,080
Why you chose to save me?

139
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
at the cost of yourself.

140
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,480
You really had a great hatred.

141
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,600
Alright.

142
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,720
As the Yiling Patriarch,

143
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,640
I was a mad defector,

144
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,960
who is perfect to revenge somebody.

145
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
A scar represents a life.

146
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,280
If I don't kill Mo Xuanyu's enemies,

147
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,360
these scars will never heal.

148
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,120
I wish I were still dead.

149
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,720
You...You...You...

150
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,040
Me...me...me...

151
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
Me what?

152
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Crazy Mo.

153
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Who allowed you to get out?

154
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,760
Get back inside now!

155
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,960
I, I,

156
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,200
I am the Mo Xuanyu?

157
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,000
Except Mo Xuanyu, who else are you?

158
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
I have told you.

159
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,400
Stop daydreaming.

160
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
You are nobody,

161
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,160
no matter how hard you try.

162
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Why don't you wear your weird mask today?

163
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,720
So,

164
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,880
I always wear my mask?

165
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,800
Psycho.

166
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,320
Before you lose your mind again,

167
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
tell me,

168
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,200
what Jin clan of Lanling did to you?

169
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,040
Why you either wore masks

170
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,440
or powdered yourself

171
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,720
after you returned from there?

172
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,760
Are you too shameful to be seen?

173
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,360
How old was I when I went to the Jinglintai?

174
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Thirteen.

175
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,560
Why did you ask?

176
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,240
Nothing.

177
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,200
I have to go now.

178
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,280
Where are you going?!

179
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,000
I...

180
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,120
You! Back!

181
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
How dare you run away.

182
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,920
I...

183
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,200
Still.

184
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,200
The peanuts are not as tasty as they were sixteen years ago.

185
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,880
Something evil appeared lately

186
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,160
and has caused many deaths.

187
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,240
Madam can finally see you people.

188
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,600
This way.

189
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
What a coincidence.

190
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
Lan clan of Gusu come here,

191
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,360
just after Mo Xuanyu brought me back.

192
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,920
Is he here too?

193
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,160
Thanks to you cultivators

194
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,600
for coming here to rid the evil thing.

195
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I have heard that

196
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,920
Lan clan of Gusu are instructed to be upright, gentle

197
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,640
and distinguished.

198
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,160
Seeing is believing.

199
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
You really match your reputation.

200
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,600
I can't agree more.

201
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080
Actually,

202
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,320
we Mo family does have some associations with the cultivators.

203
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
We're not an ordinary family.

204
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,640
There is a young man in our family

205
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,320
who once instructed by cultivators.

206
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,520
If you can stay here

207
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,680
for more days,

208
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,760
- our family... - Here I am!

209
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,440
I just heard I was mentioned.

210
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,480
I am the closest to the cultivators

211
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
among the whole family, right?

212
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,880
Who unlocked him?

213
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
Bring him back!

214
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
Get out of here.

215
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,840
That's him.

216
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
I won't go.

217
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,040
- You see. - I won't go.

218
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,400
I won't go. I won't go.

219
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,600
I want to stay here.

220
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,600
I won't go.

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
What a show.

222
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,640
I won't go.

223
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
Get out.

224
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
No! I won't!

225
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,640
- Get out. - Don't touch me!

226
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,160
- Go! - Release me!

227
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,280
I won't go.

228
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,080
Release me.

229
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,360
I won't go.

230
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,200
Don't pull me.

231
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
Release me.

232
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,440
- Get out! - Out.

233
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,480
Get lost immediately!

234
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,720
No, I won't leave.

235
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,800
Go! Stop being crazy!

236
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,360
My nephew suffered from a mental disease since childhood.

237
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,240
I hope you don't mind it.

238
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
- I won't go. - Mo Xuanyu, you nuts!

239
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,680
Leave now!

240
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
Or I will punish you hard.

241
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
Tong, take him away!

242
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,160
If you want me to leave,

243
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,160
then you should return what you stolen from me!

244
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,000
Nonsense!

245
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,310
When did I steal from you?

246
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,720
I don't need to do that.

247
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,440
Yeah.

248
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
You didn't steal.

249
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,920
You robbed!

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720
How could he do that?

251
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,110
Shame on him.

252
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,640
It hurts!

253
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,920
Hurts so much!

254
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,960
You come and see!

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,120
I want to die now.

256
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,720
What...

257
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,480
Mrs Mo held a hatred to me out of jealousy to my mother.

258
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,680
They allied

259
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,000
to bully me.

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,760
I never did that!

261
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,040
- I didn't really kick. - I want to die.

262
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,080
The footprint.

263
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,200
It can be that he kicked himself, right?

264
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
After all he is a member of the Mo family.

265
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,920
You are so cruel.

266
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,800
Yeah.

267
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,040
When he just returned

268
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
he had some reason then.

269
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
He must be driven to be mad.

270
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,800
That's right.

271
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
You god damn psycho!

272
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,360
How dare you!

273
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,400
Shut up!

274
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
If you want me to shut up

275
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,800
return my things first

276
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
or

277
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,640
kneel down to kowtow.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,240
Such a mess.

279
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
You all see that?

280
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
He stole from me and beat me!

281
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,240
Merciless!

282
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,280
Childe,

283
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
please calm down.

284
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,680
Cultivator,

285
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,120
this is my sister's son.

286
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,120
He has a mental illness.

287
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,280
All people here know it.

288
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
He had gone mad when he was young.

289
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,000
He often talks some nonsense.

290
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,680
You can't take it seriously.

291
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,360
Why he can't take my words seriously?

292
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,120
I'd say it again.

293
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,720
If any of you steals from me again

294
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
I will break one of his arms.

295
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,480
Understand?

296
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,480
Stop!

297
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,560
I shall leave now.

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
Excuse me.

299
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,360
Mrs. Mo, let's get to the point.

300
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,360
We would work in your west yard tonight.

301
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,520
Please remember,

302
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,840
don't go out of your rooms after the nightfall

303
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,880
and don't get close to that yard.

304
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,320
Yes. Yes.

305
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
Thank you so much.

306
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,840
Mother!

307
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,440
The psycho slandered me in front of everyone!

308
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,240
This is it?

309
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,040
As you said,

310
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,600
he is nobody but a bastard.

311
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Shut up!

312
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,320
The psycho is dead now!

313
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,240
Cultivators, please.

314
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Why the alcohol tastes like water?

315
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Maybe...

316
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,960
I really need to kill the whole Mo family.

317
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,600
This way.

318
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,800
Stygian Lure Falg?

319
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Assemble.

320
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
We two go to the west roof.

321
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,120
You go to the roof in the east.

322
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,960
We should explore this place

323
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,640
and try to arrange these flags

324
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,200
around the roof.

325
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,160
After that...

326
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,240
Although all clans yelled to kill me,

327
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
they still make use of the equipments

328
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
I made.

329
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,000
At that time if they come from the east,

330
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,640
we can flank them from all directions.

331
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,920
But don't disturb the people living here

332
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,120
and

333
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
the corridor here and the roof over there

334
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,840
should be guarded.

335
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,360
Be vigilant at any time.

336
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,480
Get focused.

337
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Don't be affected by the foul energy.

338
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,600
What are you doing?

339
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,080
You shouldn't be here.

340
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,600
Stop that!

341
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,800
You shouldn't fiddle with that!

342
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,920
No!

343
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,040
I want it! I want it!

344
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,560
Return it!

345
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
Or I will hurt you!

346
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,600
I won't!

347
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,040
I want it!

348
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,160
Jingyi.

349
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,640
Don't lose your temper, let's just talk to him.

350
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,720
No need to argue with him.

351
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,920
I won't beat him for real.

352
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,960
Look at him.

353
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
He messed our flag formation up.

354
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,920
The emblazonry was painted in a right way.

355
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
The spell lines were completed.

356
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,960
Nothing wrong.

357
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,640
It will work when used.

358
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,760
However the people who painted the flag is inexperienced.

359
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
The spell line painted

360
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,080
can incur the ghosts within five miles.

361
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,240
But it's enough.

362
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Childe Mo,

363
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,600
it is getting dark.

364
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,320
We're gonna fight with the evil spirit.

365
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
You'd better go back to your room.

366
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,720
It is dangerous at night.

367
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
Whatever you hear in the night

368
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,480
stay in your room.

369
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,640
What's wrong, Childe Mo?

370
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,680
Just some rug with paint.

371
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
I don't care.

372
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
I can even paint better.

373
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
What a mad.

374
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,440
Don't say that.

375
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,080
Do what we should.

376
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,400
Let's go check that place.

377
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,080
You go over there.

378
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,800
The flag formation should spread from there to here.

379
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,920
Over there?

380
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,360
Right.

381
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,120
Young master.

382
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,600
Cultivators reminded that we shouldn't get out of our room

383
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,840
and can't come to the east yard.

384
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,440
I come here to find that mad guy!

385
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,320
Go.

386
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,920
Fetch me the black flag.

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,040
But cultivators said...

388
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,800
Donkey!

389
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,920
They just fear that their items would be stolen.

390
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,240
So they frightened us deliberately.

391
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
Look at those Cultivators.

392
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
Everyone is holding a black flag.

393
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,440
Go.

394
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,120
Young master, here you are.

395
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,880
Let's go.

396
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,920
Jingyi,

397
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,760
the melody is familiar.

398
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,880
It seems like a melody from Gusu.

399
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,000
We once heard it.

400
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Did we?

401
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,520
So awfully played.

402
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,840
I have never heard it

403
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,320
Lan Zhan.

404
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,840
Pull him out and report to the officials.

405
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,320
Yeah.

406
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Don't report. Just beat him to death directly.

407
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,760
Got it.

408
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,400
It hurts.

409
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,320
- Go  - Be gentle please.

410
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,960
What happened?

411
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,160
I don't know, master.

412
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,240
Damn it.

413
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,080
The Mo family have never seen the adult Mo Xuanyu.

414
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,320
But I could be recognized by Lan clan of Gusu.

415
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Childe Mo,

416
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,360
you can stand up now.

417
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,560
Ziyuan!

418
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,200
Cultivators.

419
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,960
Puppet.

420
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,440
What should we do, master?

421
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,480
This, this, this...

422
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
My son!

423
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,040
You. It's you!

424
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
The foul possessed him.

425
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,960
It is not that easy.

426
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,680
Look at the black marks on his neck.

427
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,520
It seems like certain special symbol.

428
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,720
No.

429
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,360
Before a stick of incense is burnt out

430
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,760
two people had been murdered.

431
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,440
Cultivators, help.

432
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,560
Mrs. Mo.

433
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,640
It's him who made my son like this.

434
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,760
Why you stop me.

435
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,040
It has nothing to do with me.

436
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
I did nothing.

437
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,040
Mrs Mo, your son's symptom

438
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,800
the defected spirit,

439
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,960
is due to some evil thing.

440
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
It's not this gentleman here.

441
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,360
What do you know?

442
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
The madman's dad was a cultivator.

443
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
He learned a lot of wicked sorceries.

444
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,160
I...

445
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,960
Mrs. Mo!

446
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,840
You have no evidence!

447
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,640
So...

448
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,800
Evidence?

449
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,680
What happened to my son is the evidence!

450
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,160
The madman said

451
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,160
if my son touched his stuff,

452
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,120
he would break his arm.

453
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,680
My poor boy.

454
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,320
He didn't take anything from him.

455
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,120
The psycho not only frames my son up

456
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,720
but also hurt him in such vicious way!

457
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
You deserves it.

458
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
How dare you steal such kind of stuff.

459
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
No wonder the evil spirit possessed him.

460
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,080
Yuan! My yuan!

461
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,320
What the on earth did you do to my son!

462
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,440
Don't worry. He just passed out.

463
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,760
You are a bunch of rubbish!

464
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,760
What cultivators.

465
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,840
You can't even protect a child.

466
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,240
Shame on you!

467
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,800
You really take them as your servants, huh?

468
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,360
They came from far away

469
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,640
to help you get rid of the evil thing without any rewards.

470
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
How old is your son?

471
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,280
He should be twenty at least.

472
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,880
Doesn't he understand the human language?

473
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,040
The cultivators told us again and again that

474
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,720
we can't touch anything here

475
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,200
and don't enter the west yard.

476
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
But he himself

477
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,280
got out of his room and stole the flag.

478
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,600
It was his own fault.

479
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
Why you blame me?

480
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,280
You

481
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,880
call everyone here.

482
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,040
Move now!

483
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,120
Go. Go!

484
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,000
What are you doing?

485
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,320
How dare you disobey me?

486
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,320
Get out!

487
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,560
Master, let's go.

488
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,400
Get out of here!

489
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
Master, let's go.

490
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,320
Ding,

491
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,480
take your young master to have a rest.

492
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,600
Young master.

493
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,920
Madam.

494
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
Madam.

495
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,920
What the hell is that.

496
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,840
The evil thing is fierce.

497
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,320
Send a signal to our Second Childe Lan.

498
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,200
Madam. Madam.

499
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,080
Second Childe Lan?

500
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,600
Are you talking about that Lan Zhan?

501
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
But before he left,

502
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,880
he didn't tell us where he would go.

503
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,160
Wait.

504
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,080
You mean he is nearby.

505
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,720
It doesn't matter. Let's send him a signal first.

506
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,160
Wait.

507
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,960
It is actually unnecessary.

508
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,560
What if he can't arrive in time.

509
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,200
We don't even know what it is.

510
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,680
I mean you needn't bother him.

511
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
I can solve the problem.

512
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
Guard here and wait for him.

513
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,840
I...I said...

514
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,480
It seems like I should finish it quickly

515
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,240
Those black marks

516
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,280
were obviously left by the Stygian Tiger Amulet.

517
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,240
But the amulet has already been ruined.

518
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
What on earth

519
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,920
is it?

520
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,320
Tong, you woke up.

521
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,280
Stay back!

522
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,600
Look at his neck.

523
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,760
It's ghost! Ghost!

524
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,600
There is one

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,800
invisible ghost!

526
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
It's him.

527
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,120
He let Tong choke himself to death.

528
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,280
There is no ghost.

529
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,240
Quiet.

530
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,520
Their left arms are all broken.

531
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,200
You psycho.

532
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,640
How can you laugh at this moment.

533
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

534
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,720
Stop it.

535
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Nobody would respond to you.

536
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,560
He is not Mo Ziyuan's father.

537
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,840
That man is not Tong either.

538
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,720
Why?

539
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,440
Judge from their hands.

540
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
None of them are left-handed.

541
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,320
Every time they beat me with right hands.

542
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,840
I am clear about it.

543
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,080
What are you  proud of?

544
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,200
Look at yourself.

545
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,320
Right.

546
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,120
The evil things hide inside their left hands.

547
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,760
Can everyone lift your left hands?

548
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,120
The evil spirit is afraid of our talismans!

549
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,160
Take off clothes!

550
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,400
Wake up, it's time to work.

551
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,120
Come on.

552
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,880
Jingyi!

553
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,370
= Lan Zhan, courtesy name is Wangji =

554
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,880
Second Childe Lan!

555
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,600
He always dresses in white like funeral.

556
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,720
Second Childe Lan.

557
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,440
Second Childe Lan.

558
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,240
What is the evil thing transformed from?

559
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,320
It is so vicious.

560
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,720
It's not an evil spirit,

561
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,480
but the spiritual energy of first-class spiritual tool.

562
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,840
It hides inside a sword.

563
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,080
Maybe it is a sword ghost.

564
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,320
The first-class spiritual tool.

565
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,000
Why it has such amount of hatred?

566
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,440
Second Childe Lan.

567
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,760
That is?

568
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,880
Stygian Tiger Amulet.

569
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,840
Stygian Tiger Amulet?

570
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,760
You mean that the sword ghost has a trace of Stygian Tiger Amulet.

571
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
But the Stygian Tiger Amulet has been ruined

572
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
in the battle of the Nevernight.

573
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Maybe...

574
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,160
Maybe the Yiling Patriarch

575
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,360
didn't die.

576
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,840
Where is childe Mo?

577
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,360
Wei Ying...

578
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,560
It's really you?

579
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Thank you. Thank you.

580
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,320
What a surprise.

581
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,440
They just gave me a piece of gold for telling stories

582
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,760
about Yiling Patriarch for three days.

583
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,080
I'm rich now!

584
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,920
Back come souls.

585
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,240
Not gone to ghost realm.

586
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,480
Back come souls.

587
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,960
Not gone to ghost realm.

588
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,480
Only one revenge left.

589
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,880
Who will it be?
