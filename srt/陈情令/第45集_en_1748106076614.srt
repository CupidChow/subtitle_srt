1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fifth one is the first one.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fifth one is the first one.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fifth one is the first one.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the first one.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The fifth one is the first one.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you don't believe me,

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you can ask Mr. Ren Leng.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is there such a book about the forbidden tree in the Cloud Mountain?

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Even with this kind of music,

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
when I was studying in Gusu,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I couldn't remember the forbidden tree at all.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who said that you can go in by yourself?

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can freely go out,

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you can go in or out.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But you can't change the way of music.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He taught you that.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can freely go out

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the forbidden tree

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and you can go out.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I believe that you don't need to tell me

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who you should know.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So,

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
are you...

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You have a good idea.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can catch all the people

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and bring all the people to the mess.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Tang Lang is in charge of the construction of the palace.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He himself

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
is not injured because of his danger.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He is in a good relationship with you.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the end, hundreds of people

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
are all buried in my territory.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He said that I didn't do it.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Who would believe me?

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are not afraid of hitting me.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I am not afraid of being caught.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I hate to be in the same boat.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I hate to be in the same boat.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am afraid that no one will understand me.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You are ridiculous.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am the first capital of Tongling.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't need to fight for my father.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't need to let so many people

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
come and die.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't need to kill you.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't need to kill you.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't need to kill you.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Since you are so honest,

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and you don't want to kill me,

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
do you dare to

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
play a game

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
with your own people?

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, let's play.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's play.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's play.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You don't want to, do you?

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Fine, it's fine.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why don't you take a look?

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What is this?

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Do you really think

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we were in the Golden Forest Platform

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and were not able to attack?

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Two of the gold-lighted

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
two-spreaded cards in the secret room

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
were torn from the mess.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We have found them.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's make it happen.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you have the melody

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you just played?

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Be careful!

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did I see it wrong?

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are so powerful.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Congratulations.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But if you are not

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
a bad player,

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
why do you hide

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the truth?

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh no, he is not going to return the magic.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He is a monster.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He has a weapon.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't talk.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wei Wuxian,

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you haven't told us

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
why there is a Eagle Tiger's talisman in Su's Palace?

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This Eagle Tiger's talisman

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
was made by Xueyang.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We met Xueyang in Yicheng.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When we were in a battle with him,

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
a Ghost Face appeared.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We were going to save him, but we failed.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But Xueyang's Eagle Tiger's talisman

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
was taken away.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This Ghost Face is Su's Palace.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What?

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So,

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
these Ghosts are controlled by Su's Palace?

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Master, I can't make it.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What should I do?

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What should I do?

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
General, I will help you.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Wait.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Xuezhe,

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you know what to do.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You try.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Jin Ling!

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Jin Ling!

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You little thief!

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Come back!

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How about going back?

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How can I go back?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh no!

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What should I do?

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What should I do?

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What should I do?

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When the second attack comes,

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will take them to Xuezhe.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Han Guangjun will be killed.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Here,

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
there is a treasure.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Remember,

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
don't fight.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Just go outside.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They won't attack you.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't fight.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
One is enough.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Han Guangjun will kill me.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't mess with others.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Listen to him.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The first attack is over.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The second attack is over.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The third attack is over.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The fourth attack is over.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The fourth attack is over.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The fourth attack is over.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The fourth attack is over.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The fourth attack is over.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The fourth attack is over.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The fourth attack is over.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The fourth attack is over.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The fourth attack is over.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The fourth attack is over.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The fourth attack is over.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The fourth attack is over.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
Wen Ning.

173
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
Hurry to take them away.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,760
Meanger, you

175
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,060
Later

176
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,840
Meanger was the lucky one

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,040
Give him back

178
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,720
Don't see

179
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,720
Today

180
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,400
Let me go

181
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
My my my okay

182
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Never.

183
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,400
Give up

184
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,740
Without

185
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,240
you

186
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,840
You

187
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Sorry

188
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,500
Win

189
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,400
Because

190
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,720
myself

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Why don't we go to Lotus Cove first?

192
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
It's the nearest one in the town.

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Okay, okay.

194
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Chief Yao, are we leaving?

195
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
No, we're still here.

196
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
What if those ghosts come to Gongjia Mountain?

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They haven't come back yet.

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They won't come back.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Exactly.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
What nonsense!

201
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Si Xue!

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
What are you doing?

203
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
You're dead! Come back!

204
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Where are you going?

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Senior Wei.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Si Zui.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Senior Wei!

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Are you okay?

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Si Zui, we're fine.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you scared?

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not scared.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm just...

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm just...

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm just scared.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm just scared.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm just scared.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm just scared.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know why.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm just...

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm just scared.

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm just scared.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Senior Wei!

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Senior Wei!

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Senior Wei!

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Senior Wei! Wake up!

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Senior Wei!

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Senior Wei!

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ah Yue.

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I didn't expect that.

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Su Su, Su Shuo,

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
is actually like this.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Exactly.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I didn't expect that.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But it's not true.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why did he do that?

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Is it because of Wei Wuxian?

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You guys don't know

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
what Wei Wuxian said

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
when he was at the Golden Bell Tower.

240
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Could it be...

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Lord Lianfang?

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Although Wei Wuxian is not a good person,

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there are some things

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
that are not necessarily true.

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I heard that.

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Good people are good people.

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I heard that too.

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,440
Seeing a bad swordsman is like

249
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,000
doing everything in return.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
To think

251
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
that

252
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,000
he got too inevitable.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Even though during a失给 festival skeletons,

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
good people always

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
can't get themselves into the battle.

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There are many Northern warriors

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
like you.

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Everyone,

259
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you need to.

260
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,860
You need to master the damp sword.

261
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
I was so old that my double-dead ship was like this.

262
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Maybe I was born like this.

263
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,860
Let's go.

264
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Gui... General Gui!

265
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
What is he doing?

266
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Why is General Gui here?

267
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Gui Ling.

268
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Is he going to board our ship?

269
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Who knows?

270
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,860
Shouldn't he be with Senior Wei?

271
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
He's here.

272
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,860
What... What's your name?

273
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
I'm Gu Su Lan's brother.

274
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
My name is Lan Yuan.

275
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Lan Yuan?

276
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Do you know who gave you your name?

277
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
Of course, my parents did.

278
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
What did he do?

279
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Did your parents still live there?

280
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,860
My parents passed away when I was little.

281
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
Senior Si Zhi, don't say so much.

282
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
Be careful.

283
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
How is it?

284
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Si Zhi Zhi.

285
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Si Zhi Zhi.

286
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
It's your name.

287
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,860
Si Zhi Zhi. It's your name.

288
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Yes.

289
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
Who gave you your name?

290
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Lord Han Guang.

291
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Gui... Mr. Wen.

292
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Is my name any problem?

293
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
No.

294
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
No.

295
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,860
You look like a person who is far away from me.

296
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,860
You think you're a ghost or a man of your word?

297
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Where am I?

298
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,860
I've seen this place before.

299
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
Mr. Lan.

300
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,860
Mr. Wen.

301
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Can I call you...

302
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Lan Yuan?

303
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Sure.

304
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Lan Yuan.

305
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Lan Yuan.

306
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Have you been well these years?

307
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
I've been doing very well.

308
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Lord Han Guang must be very nice to you.

309
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Lord Han Guang is as kind as me.

310
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
He taught me everything.

311
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Lord Han Guang,

312
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,860
since you were a child,

313
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,860
I've been taking care of you.

314
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
I can't remember.

315
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,860
I was about 45 years old.

316
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,860
But when I was younger,

317
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Lord Han Guang couldn't take me with him.

318
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,860
I think he was away for a few years.

319
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
What's he doing?

320
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,860
I bought this when I was crossing the bridge.

321
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,860
I think you'll like it.

322
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I'll give it to you.

323
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
An Yu.

324
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
Bridal Mask

325
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,860
Someone is approaching Mr. Lan.

326
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Who is it?

327
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
It's Mr. YAO JINGLING.

328
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
Mr. CAis.

329
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Go for him.

330
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
It's none of your business.

331
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,420
Jianlin,

332
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,820
take the sword first.

333
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,020
Don't hit me.

334
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,220
Si Zui.

335
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,980
Mr. Jin,

336
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,300
if you have anything,

337
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,300
come to me.

338
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,420
I will not resist.

339
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,740
But,

340
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,660
A'Yu,

341
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,060
Mr. Lan Yuan,

342
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,460
Jianlin,

343
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,420
why are you like this?

344
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,020
Si Zui is trying to hurt you.

345
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,140
Yes.

346
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,260
He is doing this for your own good.

347
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,740
If you don't love him,

348
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,660
why are you still pushing him away?

349
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,820
No one cares about the religion.

350
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,460
Yes.

351
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,420
I am just a rascal.

352
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,260
How is it?

353
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,140
You are so stubborn.

354
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,300
You are so unreasonable.

355
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,900
You are so stubborn.

356
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,780
You are so rude.

357
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,300
You don't have any religion.

358
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,780
Who do you think we are?

359
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,980
Exactly.

360
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,900
Jianlin.

361
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,060
Jianlin.

362
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,620
Wei Ying.

363
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,140
Jianlin.

364
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,220
Lan Zhan,

365
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,900
what happened?

366
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,820
You fainted.

367
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,460
It's not me.

368
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,180
It's Jianlin.

369
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,580
What's wrong with them?

370
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,340
It was you who touched it first.

371
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,500
Why are you still angry?

372
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,580
Don't say that.

373
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
I am not bothered by religion.

374
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,620
I can't stand you.

375
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,140
What happened?

376
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,980
Wenjing.

377
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,140
What's wrong?

378
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,620
Sir.

379
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,780
I am sorry.

380
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,580
It's all my fault.

381
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,660
I...

382
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,540
I can't stand it.

383
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,700
I just...

384
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,620
I just want to see.

385
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,300
You are so stubborn.

386
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,060
Jianlin.

387
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,220
Put down your sword.

388
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,780
I won't.

389
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,900
Jianlin.

390
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,380
I won't.

391
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,740
Don't make trouble.

392
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,060
Okay.

393
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
It's all my fault.

394
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
It's all my fault.

395
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,260
It's all my fault.

396
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,140
It's all my fault.

397
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
It's all my fault.

398
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,660
No.

399
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,700
Ling.

400
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,140
Ling.

401
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,220
Why are you crying?

402
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,980
Come here.

403
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,660
What's wrong?

404
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,460
Who bullied you?

405
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,580
Wei Wuxian.

406
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,580
Why did you go to the secret room?

407
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,500
Chief Yang.

408
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,660
Why did you talk like this?

409
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,820
If you want to do something for me,

410
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,380
I'm afraid we can't do anything now.

411
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,220
You...

412
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,580
Zichen is right.

413
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,020
Chief Yang.

414
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,460
If you remember it,

415
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,940
that person must be your son.

416
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,740
He is so good at talking.

417
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,540
Zizhi.

418
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,260
Come here.

419
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,020
Come here.

420
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,860
Dad.

421
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,940
Didn't you ask me to stop bothering you?

422
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,300
Fine.

423
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,540
You're not enough to get out of the wind today.

424
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,460
Come with me.

425
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,740
I'm not going.

426
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,700
You...

427
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,540
You're really getting worse.

428
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,060
If you don't come,

429
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,180
I'll catch you.

430
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,500
Dad.

431
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,180
You should go in and rest.

432
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,820
You haven't recovered.

433
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,500
Go in.

434
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,980
Chief.

435
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,940
We're going to sail.

436
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,780
Do you want to go back to Lianhua?

437
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,380
You want to go back to Lianhua?

438
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,740
Go!

439
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,900
Go back to Lianhua!

440
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,740
Master.

441
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,860
I'll wait for you outside.

442
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,020
I'll wait for you outside.

443
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,500
Sichuan.

444
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,420
Mr. Wen.

445
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,020
Let me accompany you.

446
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,740
You accompany me?

447
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,980
Yes.

448
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,180
Anyway,

449
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
it's not useful to go in

450
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,380
when the senior is in.

451
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,980
It's useless if I go in.

452
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,540
Let's continue.

453
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,060
Where did we just talk?

454
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,920
Lost in the ch!!!

455
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,740
where has it started?

456
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
He dropped a few colors.

457
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,420
Mr. Wen.

458
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,580
Tell me.

459
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,500
Are the 5-year-old boys

460
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,300
living in the compiled soil?

461
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Just like that.

462
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
toppings.

463
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,060
All booze bagsars and wing gnome

464
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,080
All what you supposed to be

465
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,440
You got it

466
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,200
I don't feel like you'll ever put this kid in my life

467
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,520
That child is so pitiful

468
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,580
But..

469
00:27:41,600 --> 00:28:00,500
Actually I could say this when I was still a

470
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,100
Chief!

471
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,180
For you,

472
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,400
Have you kept the money?

473
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,160
No,

474
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,900
we have it then.

475
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,480
We have no time to talk about it here.

476
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,280
The disciple said the two women

477
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,360
came for today's things.

478
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,040
And he brought bottle of valuable medicine to come

479
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,360
to know which ones were hurt by the chief.

480
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,540
thanks for your attention.

481
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,740
Everybody.

482
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,500
You may sit down here,

483
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,380
or at any time,

484
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,500
before we leave.

485
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,620
Right away.

486
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,440
This way.

487
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Mr. Huang,

488
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,580
Mr. Huang!

489
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,180
Please have him sit.

490
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Move, everyone.

491
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,340
All right, students.

492
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,860
Thanks, everybody.

493
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,080
All right.

494
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,900
andikan

495
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,220
man has

496
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,300
Akai

497
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,740
Akai

498
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,340
Akai

499
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,420
Akai

500
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,000
...

501
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,500
Akai

502
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,240
...

503
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,960
Akai

504
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,240
...

505
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,760
Lierz 허

506
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,040
Antwerp

507
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,100
Jiang Cheng has been gone for so long

508
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,800
why hasn't he come back yet

509
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,660
weak

510
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,880
shit

511
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,900
Just look into the further left area, please.

512
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,480
I have found Pictures ofуш.

513
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,200
Wait.

514
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
I think I am out.

515
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,800
We all went to Hanyong today,

516
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,920
but there was none.

517
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,920
Four prizes were the best deal in jingxing.

518
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,400
There might be something we couldn't restore here.

519
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,760
Okay.

520
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,640
Take it as a personal omen.

521
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,080
kızım.

522
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,800
Who said that?

523
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,840
I...

524
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,800
I'll go first.

525
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
I want to say

526
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,080
it's a 11-year-old old man.

527
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,440
My name is Si Si.

528
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,640
I was a businesswoman.

529
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm a famous woman.

530
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,080
I was thinking of getting a rich man.

531
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,840
But he's a good man.

532
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
I found a bunch of men

533
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
who cut my face.

534
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
Let me take you home.

535
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,320
sehen.

536
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,080
I don't know exactly what you've been talking about.

537
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,560
We're not close either.

538
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,360
So why do I need your help?

539
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,640
Say what I say.

540
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,380
All right.

541
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,240
My face became like this.

542
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Yuan Xian kicked me out of the house.

543
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
I wouldn't do anything else.

544
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,080
I just worked with those old sisters who were in their prime.

545
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Their customers' demands aren't high.

546
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,080
They'll take me with them if there's anything.

547
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,080
I can even light a fire if I cover my face.

548
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,080
One day, a sister with the same gender

549
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
suddenly received a message.

550
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:30,080
She ordered so many of us to take us to a place with a carriage.

551
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
She ordered so many people at once.

552
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
She's a rich lady.

553
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,080
She was rich, but she couldn't afford to buy you.

554
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,080
I was so shocked that I still felt something was wrong.

555
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Why would she find us?

556
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,080
To be honest, there's no such thing as cheap.

557
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
We're here.

558
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
I think so.

559
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
We're here.

560
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Let's go.

561
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Hurry up.

562
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
You're so ugly.

563
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Take her inside.

564
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
Let's have fun with the old stuff.

565
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Let's go.

566
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Hold it.

567
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
What's wrong?

568
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
What's wrong?

569
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
What's wrong?

570
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
What's wrong?

571
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
What are you doing there?

572
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
What do you want to do?

573
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
I don't need to teach you anymore.

574
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Yes.

575
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
What's wrong?

576
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Father, I've found a woman you love.

577
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
There are many of them.

578
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Are you happy?

579
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
It's Jin Guangyao.

580
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Jin Guangyao?

581
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Yes.

582
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Jin Guangyao?

583
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Yes.

584
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Jin Guangyao?

585
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Yes.

586
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Yes.

587
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Well,

588
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
the one lying down is...

589
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
You are...

590
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Go on.

591
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
What happened later?

592
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,080
The man was shouting and fighting.

593
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,080
But he didn't have strength.

594
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
He didn't recover.

595
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,080
He was out of breath.

596
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
He didn't get any more breath.

597
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
He...

598
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
He died like this?

599
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Isn't that so?

600
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Who saw this kind of symptoms?

601
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
We were so scared.

602
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,080
We were thinking about stopping this transaction.

603
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
But...

604
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
But the man behind the curtain said...

605
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
He said...

606
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
What did he say?

607
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
He said...

608
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
He said...

609
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
He said he died.

610
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
What's wrong?

611
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
What's going on?

612
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
No matter how Jin Guangyao says it,

613
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
he is his biological father.

614
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
If this is true,

615
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
this is...

616
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
This is...

617
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
When that man died,

618
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
I knew we were all dead.

619
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Indeed,

620
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
at that time,

621
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
my twenty-some old sisters

622
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
were all killed.

623
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
They were all left.

624
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Why did you stay alone?

625
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I don't know.

626
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I was begging for help.

627
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
I didn't want money.

628
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I would never say it.

629
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I didn't expect that

630
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
they really didn't kill me.

631
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
They put me in a prison.

632
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,080
It was only for eleven years.

633
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
It was only until recently

634
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
that I was saved by someone.

635
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
I escaped.

636
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Who saved you?

637
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I don't know.

638
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
I've never seen someone who saved me.

639
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
After he heard my story,

640
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
he decided not to let this

641
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
unfaithful, unfaithful man

642
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
continue to deceive everyone.

643
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Even if he is in trouble,

644
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
he will do everything

645
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,080
to make everyone happy.

646
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
He even let me

647
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
save my twenty-some old sisters

648
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
from the justice he caused.

649
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
I'm relieved.

650
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
What's the evidence

651
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
you're talking about?

652
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Nothing.

653
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
He knows everything so well.

654
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
He's not lying.

655
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Miss.

656
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I think I've seen you before.

657
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
I think...

658
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
I think I've seen you before.

659
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
When I held the Qingtang meeting

660
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
at the Moon Forest,

661
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
I was around my wife.

662
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Moon Forest?

663
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
I don't know.

664
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
I don't know.

665
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Are you

666
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
the maid of Mrs. Jin?

667
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Yes.

668
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Mr. Lan remembers it correctly.

669
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I'm the maid of Mrs. Jin.

670
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
I'm called Bi Cao.

671
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
What I'm going to say

672
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
happened earlier.

673
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
About

674
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
twelve or three years ago,

675
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
I saw my sister grow up.

676
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
My old lady

677
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
always loved my sister.

678
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
But in the period

679
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
when she was about to get married,

680
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
she was in a bad mood.

681
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
She was not happy all day.

682
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
She even had a cold

683
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
and suddenly had tears in her eyes.

684
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
She had nightmares every night.

685
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
I thought

686
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
it was because she wanted to get married.

687
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
I couldn't bear to leave her.

688
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
So I comforted her

689
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
and said

690
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
the maid of Mrs. Jin

691
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,080
was young and handsome.

692
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
She was a gentle and considerate man.

693
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
She was a man who was professional.

694
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
She would live well

695
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
when she married her.

696
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
But after she heard it,

697
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
she seemed to be in a bad mood.

698
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
After a few days,

699
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
she decided to get married.

700
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
When she saw the iron

701
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
she fainted.

702
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
After she got married,

703
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
she kept on being unhappy.

704
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
She had a new illness.

705
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
She got worse and worse.

706
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Before she got married,

707
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
she finally couldn't bear to tell me

708
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
everything.

709
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
The maid of the house,

710
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Jin Guangyao

711
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,080
and my sister, Qin Su,

712
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
were not married.

713
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
They were just

714
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,080
a couple.

715
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
My wife

716
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
was really bad.

717
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
The old lady

718
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
was so mean.

719
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
She was so mean.

720
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
She was so mean to my wife.

721
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
After she got drunk again,

722
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
she forced her.

723
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
How could she resist?

724
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
She was so ungrateful.

725
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Jin Guangshan

726
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
didn't know

727
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
who her daughter was.

728
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
But how could my wife

729
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
forget?

730
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
She didn't go to Jin Guangshan.

731
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
She knew my lady

732
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
was so kind.

733
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
Jin Guangyao

734
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
had been fighting for a long time.

735
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
To stop her from making a big mistake,

736
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
she even found her

737
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
before she got married.

738
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
She was so innocent

739
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
and she was so bitter.

740
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Xu Xiaozhen was so mad

741
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080
that she couldn't make a big mistake.

742
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
Who knew

743
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Jin Guangyao

744
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,080
knew my lady was her sister?

745
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
But she still married her.

746
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
She was so mean.

747
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
She was so mean.

748
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
How many years

749
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
did she follow Jin Guangshan?

750
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
She even

751
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
stopped her

752
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
wife from making a mistake.

753
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
Jin Guangshan

754
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
is so mean.

755
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Yes.

756
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Jin Guangshan

757
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
Jin Guangshan

758
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Jin Guangshan
