I don't want to live with you.

Enough, Princess Jiang.

163
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
That's a Purple Palace.

164
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
As long as it's a private residence,

165
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Purple Palace will be out soon.

166
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
After Wei Wuxian died,

he couldn't find the corpse,

168
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
even the soul-breaking.

169

How do you know he's dead?

170
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
Tell me.

171
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Who are you?

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
16 years.

173
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
You're awake.

174
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
I'm not.

175
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,460

182
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
I didn't expect

183
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460

184
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,460
I saw you chase the valley.

185
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
Jiangcheng was going to the cliff

186
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
to see the white valley.

187
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
What about you?

188
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Did you go to see me?

189
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
Three years later,

190
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
I went to see the white valley.

191
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,460
But I didn't see the white valley.

192
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
Why did you go there?

193
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,460
It's been 16 years.

194
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
It's been 16 years.

195
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,460
If I tell you,

196
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
I don't know where I am.

197
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
Do you believe me?

198
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
I believe you.

199
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Anzhen.

200
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
But at that time,

201
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,460
do you really believe me?

202
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm not.

203
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
I'm just a dream.

204
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
I'm just a dream.

205
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,460
I'm just a dream.

206
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
I'm just a dream.

207
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
I'm just a dream.

208
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
I'm just a dream.

209
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
I'm just a dream.

210
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
I'm just a dream.

211
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
I'm just a dream.

212
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
I'm just a dream.

213
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
I'm just a dream.

214
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
I'm just a dream.

215
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
I'm just a dream.

216
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,460
I'm just a dream.

217
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
I'm just a dream.

218
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
I'm just a dream.

219
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
So, I heard that you left.

220
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
I'm sure you're happy.

221
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Uncle Hu.

222
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
I'm telling you.

223
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Everyone in the family

224
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,460
likes me.

225
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Then,

226
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,460
why do you have to fight with Lan Zhan

227
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
for so many family members?

228
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Can't I appreciate him?

229
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,460
No one can beat me.

230
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
I'm a lonely man.

231
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
It's hard to beat a man.

232
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
It's not easy.

233
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Yes.

234
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
My mom likes me the most.

235
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,460
What?

236
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
What?

237
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
Do you want it or not?

238
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Sister, look at him.

239
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
You're annoying.

240
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Don't run.

241
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
Okay.

242
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Don't come over.

243
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Don't run.

244
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Sister.

245
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
You're still running.

246
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Don't make trouble between you two.

247
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Sister.

248
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Look at me.

249
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
Stop.

250
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,460
I don't know where I am.

251
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm just a dream.

252
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
You...

253
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Look at him.

254
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Stop.

255
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
I'm sorry.

256
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
I'm sorry.

257
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Little rabbit.

258
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Do you still remember me?

259
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,460
I didn't expect that after so many years,

260
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,460
you two still have to stay here.

261
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Lan Zhan said

262
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
he doesn't like you two.

263
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
I'm sorry.

264
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Sister.

265
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
You're awake.

266
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
Lan Zhan.

267
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
The barrier on your body.

268
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
You're always the mastermind of the family.

269
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
What kind of thing

270
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,460
is going to be punished so badly?

271
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
Lan Zhan.

272
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Answer me.

273
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
Lord Han.

274
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
Lord Han.

275
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Lord Han.

276
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Lord Han.

277
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
Lord Han.

278
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
What's the matter?

279
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
It's a matter of fate.

280
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
I'm in a hurry.

281
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,460
But I can't control it.

282
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
Si Shui.

283
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Are you okay?

284
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
What happened?

285
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Lord Han.

286
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Mr. Lan wanted to ask you something.

287
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
He suddenly got up and got up.

288
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,460
He was so strong.

289
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
We couldn't control him.

290
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Why?

291
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
The sword in the Mojia Manor.

292
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,460
Lord Han.

293
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
What's the harm in the evil spirit?

294
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
It's so dangerous.

295
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
It's not the evil spirit.

296
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
It's the spirit of the Yi-Ping Spirit.

297
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
The sword in the Mojia Manor is the most dangerous.

298
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
Yi-Ping Spirit?

299
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
How could there be such a big reason?

300
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Lord Ying.

301
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Master.

302
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Master.

303
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Master.

304
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
Master.

305
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
Master.

306
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Master.

307
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
Mr. Lan is here.

308
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
I can't let go of the Majia Manor.

309
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Master.

310
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
Stop the blow.

311
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Get out.

312
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Get out.

313
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Oexu.

314
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,460
The first time I saw a cat, I thought it was a cat.

315
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,460
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

316
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,460
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

317
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,460
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

318
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I was surprised by the fact that it was a cat.

319
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I am stunned by its treating.

320
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,460
I'm shocked by the fact it is such a cat.

321
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,780
How come you were soo close to your dad?

322
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,740
Don't talk to me now...

323
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,240
All right

324
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,820
I saw the mark of fire

325
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,420
but how could it be?

326
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,760
I search the arm but don't get eaten

327
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,740
Lord Han, the medicine and the stone needles are all useless.

328
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,740
How... how should we do this?

329
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Lord Han, this sword and the spirit have infected the Black Spirit of the Tiger Manor.

330
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Could it be that the Yiling Patriarch really went out of the world?

331
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,740
If that's the case, how should we do this?

332
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,740
Maybe Yiling Patriarch has already died for 16 years.

333
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Could it be that he really took the shot?

334
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,740
You all can leave.

335
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Si Zui, go back to your room and rest.

336
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
But, Lord Han...

337
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Don't stay up too late. Go.

338
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Yes.

339
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
What's wrong?

340
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Senior Mo.

341
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
What's wrong?

342
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
I'm a little bit guilty.

343
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
What are you guilty of?

344
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,740
The Yiling Patriarch came to us.

345
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
How do you know?

346
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
How do you know?

347
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,740
Different types of Zhaoying Qi have different patterns and power.

348
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,740
In the past, in the Mo family's drawing,

349
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Zhaoying Qi used the range only in the Fang Yuan Wu Li.

350
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
But the sword and the spirit...

351
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
The weapon was too heavy.

352
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,740
If he used the range in the beginning,

353
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
and the intensity of the poison,

354
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Mo's family already had blood flow.

355
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
But...

356
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,740
He only appeared there after we reached the base.

357
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,740
Even if he was deliberately placed in that place

358
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,740
by someone who was very considerate of him.

359
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,740
The homework is quite good.

360
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
You did a good job.

361
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,740
In that case,

362
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,740
we are also responsible for what happened in the Mo family.

363
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Now, Mr. Lan of the Han family is also confused.

364
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,740
You are responsible for not the two of you.

365
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,740
But the one who placed the sword and the spirit.

366
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,740
There are many things in this world

367
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,740
that we can't control.

368
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,740
Mr. Mo,

369
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
why are you wearing the mask again?

370
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Nothing.

371
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,740
I'm just afraid to see a few old friends.

372
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,740
You don't suspect that I did it, do you?

373
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,740
I've been sleeping for 16 years.

374
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
I believe you.

375
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
But...

376
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,740
What is the meaning of the black spirit of the Dark Tiger Manor?

377
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,740
It's impossible to say.

378
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,740
I already destroyed the Dark Tiger Manor

379
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,740
and turned it into a broken piece of paper.

380
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,740
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

381
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,740
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

382
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,740
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

383
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,740
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

384
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
If someone is trying to break the piece of paper,

385
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,740
it's impossible.

386
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,740
The Dark Tiger Manor is destroyed.

387
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
It's useless to break the piece of paper.

388
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
Unless...

389
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,740
Unless they use the Dark Iron to make another piece of paper.

390
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Xue Yang?

391
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Actually, I always had a question.

392
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,740
It's said that the Dark Iron has a spirit and it's four directions.

393
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,740
It sounds like there are four pieces of Dark Iron.

394
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,740
But I don't think so.

395
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,740
At least if Xue Yang really has the Dark Iron,

396
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,740
plus the Dark Iron I took from Xuan Wu Cave,

397
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,740
it's all five-dimensional.

398
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,740
So, Xue Yang might have the Dark Tiger Manor.

399
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Then there must be the pieces of the Dark Tiger Manor I used to know.

400
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Otherwise, even if he's smart,

401
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,740
it's impossible for him to be the same.

402
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Man Zhan, have you ever thought about

403
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,740
the sword spirit that was used by the Dark Tiger Manor

404
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,740
and the one that appeared in the Mo Family?

405
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Could it be too small and too powerful?

406
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,740
In the 16th year, you and Jiang Cheng were both sent to the country

407
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,740
to search for the Wei State.

408
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,740
I didn't even know where I was going to die.

409
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,740
The result is a mysterious, mysterious, mysterious word.

410
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,740
How did you know where I was going to die?

411
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,740
And...

412
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,740
The Dark Iron in the Mo Family?

413
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,740
And the one who was in the Five-Demon Realm?

414
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,740
Anyway, no matter who this person is,

415
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,740
I'm the one who made all this happen.

416
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,740
The Dark Tiger Manor

417
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,740
Lord Han Guang, how is it?

418
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,740
It's a basic element.

419
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,740
That's right. It's a basic element.

420
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
As long as you find the master of the Sword Spirit,

421
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,740
and know who he is,

422
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
you can save him.

423
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,740
It's easy for you to say.

424
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
Where are you going?

425
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
North West.

426
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
North West?

427
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Lord Han Guang, why are you in the north west?

428
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Isn't this only for you?

429
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,740
It's only for me.

430
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,740
Who? Who knows?

431
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Lord Han Guang didn't tell me.

432
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,740
He did.

433
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,740
He...

434
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
What is he pointing at?

435
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
What else can he point at?

436
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,740
Either he pointed at the direction he was coming from,

437
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,740
or he pointed at the person who sent him to the murderer.

438
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Si Zhu,

439
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,740
be sure to be well-behaved.

440
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
Yes.

441
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Lord Han Guang,

442
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
are you going to go down the mountain?

443
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,740
Okay, okay, okay.

444
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,740
I finally don't need to be in the charge of my power.

445
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,740
We're going to Qing He.

446
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
As far as the north west goes,

447
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,740
the murderer in the Sword Spirit is Yuan Qing.

448
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
It seems that as far as we go,

449
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,740
he is near us.

450
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
We're going to the city.

451
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I'll come over.

452
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,740
We're not going to the city.

453
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,740
I'll be there.

454
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
You can go.

455
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,740
I'll come over.

456
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
We're going to the city.

457
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
I'll go there.

458
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,020
Nothing much.

459
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,740
Here, have a look at this.

460
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,120
Give them back, you must not let go.

461
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,320
Therints of Loser Hate them all,

462
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,160
and he spontaneouslyветo out their cure!

463
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,140
Hey, what are you selling?

464
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,300
There's everything.

465
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,500
The one with the disease, the one with the disease.

466
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,540
What do you want?

467
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,900
Why, sir?

468
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,140
You want the disease or the disease?

469
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,540
Guess.

470
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,980
Well...

471
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,380
This...

472
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,340
Sir, I see you have dark eyes and black teeth.

473
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,580
You must have a lot of blood.

474
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,380
You can have a few of these.

475
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,300
The one with the disease.

476
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,660
Hey, hey, hey.

477
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,460
I'll give you a five-pointed sword and three-pointed sword.

478
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,460
I'll give you a five-pointed sword and three-pointed sword.

479
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,060
You can't afford to buy this price.

480
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,300
You can't afford to buy it.

481
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,860
Three-pointed sword is good.

482
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
One-pointed sword is a big door.

483
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,020
One-pointed sword is a big hall.

484
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,700
And one-pointed sword is a bed head.

485
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,460
The one with the disease, the one with the disease.

486
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,660
A lot of poison.

487
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,540
I guarantee that any monster or monster

488
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,740
will not dare to enter your body.

489
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,700
Hey, I said that Wei Wuxian

490
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,540
is a beautiful man who is far away from civilization.

491
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,740
What the hell is that?

492
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,700
Even if you haven't seen the real man,

493
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,540
don't just randomly draw.

494
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,940
You're a man of no value.

495
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,300
Hey, hey, hey.

496
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,540
You're talking about real things.

497
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,940
It seems that you've seen Wei Wuxian.

498
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,740
I...

499
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,540
What the hell is he doing here?

500
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
You...

501
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
Why are you so angry?

502
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,540
I'm angry with you.

503
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,540
You dare to talk to Wei Wuxian in front of me?

504
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,540
I won't kill him.

505
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
He should have treated me with kindness.

506
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,540
You dare to be a ghost and a ghost?

507
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
You're looking for trouble?

508
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
You're not a ghost.

509
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
You're a ghost.

510
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,540
You're a ghost.

511
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
You're a ghost.

512
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
You're looking for trouble?

513
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,540
Jinling, this kid...

514
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
I don't know what's going on.

515
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,540
He's very strong and has a strong temper.

516
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
He's very sensitive and has no sense of humor.

517
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,540
He learned a lesson from his uncle and father's bad hands.

518
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,540
His mother's benefit is that he didn't learn much.

519
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
If I don't beat him,

520
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
I'll call him a ghost sooner or later.

521
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Jinling.

522
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
You haven't run away yet?

523
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,540
You're fine.

524
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,540
I don't know who was the one who was pushed down by me last time.

525
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,540
Who was it?

526
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Xie Zi!

527
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Xie Zi!

528
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
Xie Zi!

529
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,540
Xie Zi!

530
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,540
Xie Zi!
