The final success

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
everyone knows.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Everyone has stories.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
XinZi!

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
migration

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wherever you are...

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come with me.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can't hear there.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,040
三长,我们再来一下。

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,860
来吧,让我挑B.

39
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,640
Charger!

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,540
Fighting?

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
Go.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,860
Thank god you are here.

43
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,060
Brother universe

44
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,140
Thanks for the쳵

45
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,300
Bon appétit

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,960
Thank you

47
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,480
Son

48
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,580
who

49
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,120
of you

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,920
Son

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,980
Thank you

52
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,360
I want the watch

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,380
I'll have it

54
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
for most of it

55
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,520
Brought

56
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
If you really want to thank me,

57
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
draw it better.

58
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

59
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
How did you draw it?

60
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
How about me?

61
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Anyway, I'll give it to you first.

62
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Don't go first.

63
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
There's something I want to ask you.

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Since you say that you often sit here and buy and buy,

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,860
do you have any thoughts or impressions recently?

66
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
You ask me?

67
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,860
That's right.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
I often drink tea with this.

69
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
I'm from the same family.

70
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
I'm from the same family.

71
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,860
I drink tea with this.

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,860
I don't know what you want to ask me.

73
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,860
For example, what demon is broken?

74
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
The branch is broken.

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,860
What is the secret door?

76
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
There's no such thing.

77
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
But you go to the front and walk five or six miles.

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
There's a place called the行-long-distance.

79
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,860
I suggest you not to go there.

80
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,860
What do you mean?

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,860
This行-long-distance has a name.

82
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,860
It's called the human-distance.

83
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
What do you mean?

84
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,860
It's because there's a demon on this road.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Right?

86
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
Come on.

87
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,860
It's said that there's a human-distance treasure in the forest.

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
The demon inside is a special person.

89
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
If someone breaks into it,

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,860
it will be bitten and the bones will be burned.

91
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
The body can't be found.

92
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
It's not a surprise.

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Are you scared?

94
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
I'm really scared.

95
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,860
But since the bones are not left,

96
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,860
how do you know they were eaten?

97
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
You know,

98
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,860
someone saw it anyway.

99
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,860
But you just said that

100
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,860
since the intruder is not left,

101
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
it's no surprise.

102
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Who is this person?

103
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,860
He's so powerful.

104
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,860
He can still tell the news.

105
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
You're so good at talking.

106
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
I don't know.

107
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,860
Do you know how many people were eaten in the forest?

108
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
When was it eaten?

109
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,860
What is the name of the man and woman?

110
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
What is the family name?

111
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
I don't know.

112
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
The white-haired white-haired.

113
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Don't go.

114
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,860
I'll ask one last question.

115
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
In the forest,

116
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
is there a person inside the forest?

117
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Is it the family of the Nei family?

118
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Isn't the family of the Nei family?

119
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,860
If there is a person in the forest,

120
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
and there is a monster,

121
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
the Nei family will be in charge of it.

122
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Nei family?

123
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,860
If it's the Nei family,

124
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,860
of course it won't be in charge of it.

125
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,860
The news is spread out in the second day.

126
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
It will be a thunderous event.

127
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,860
It will be a great place to get rid of the demons.

128
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,860
But the Nei family's family is the one

129
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,860
who doesn't know about the third.

130
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
I don't know.

131
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
I don't know.

132
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
I really don't know.

133
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
You guys,

134
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
don't ask me.

135
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
I really don't know anything.

136
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
What else can he do?

137
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Ask the third not to eat?

138
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
I didn't expect

139
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
that Huai Sang

140
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
actually became the Nei family's master.

141
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
He got the title of the third not to eat.

142
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I didn't expect

143
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,860
that the Chifeng遵 is so mysterious.

144
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Why is he so dead?

145
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
I didn't see it clearly.

146
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
I only know that the fire is in the wood

147
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
and the demon is in the forest.

148
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
It's the king of the world.

149
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Dog! Dog!

150
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,860
Wei Ying, there's no dog.

151
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Dog!

152
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Don't look at me like that.

153
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Why are you afraid of dogs?

154
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Don't ask me why.

155
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Lan Zhan.

156
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
I told you that I love you.

157
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
I told you.

158
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
I...

159
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,860
When I was young,

160
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
I used to stay outside

161
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,860
and often did things under my mouth.

162
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Uncle Jiang took me back to the human world.

163
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
But I had to drive away

164
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,860
his little love and nothing else.

165
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Now, Jin Ling is the same.

166
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,860
They are indeed a family.

167
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,860
They are as hateful as Jiang Cheng.

168
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Lan Zhan, let's go.

169
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
This time, it's not wrong.

170
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
What are you hiding in the distance?

171
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
I don't care.

172
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,860
I'll hide for a while.

173
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
It's the spirit ring of Jin Ling.

174
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
The ring is empty.

175
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
What must it be?

176
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Well...

177
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Well...

178
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Let's go and see.

179
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,860
Well...

180
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Lord Han Guang, you go.

181
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
If you don't move, how will I move?

182
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,860
You go first.

183
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
There is a maze here.

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
The maze is known as the human maze.

185
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
It seems that the message about the path

186
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
is not the same as the one in the book.

187
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,860
Lan Zhan, look.

188
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,860
Princess Xiao.

189
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Keep под checking.

190
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Princess Xiao.

191
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:48,060
The science ion is

192
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,860
as deep as a pig'sczyn.

193
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,660
I heard you say again,

194
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,860
and you said your elders prefer poetry.

195
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Isn't it so strange?

196
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,760
That is true, what do you mean?

197
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,760
Prince law.

198
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Ah!

199
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
How did I only hear the dog barking?

200
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I didn't see the dog.

201
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,160
No matter how much you have the spirit, you can't break through the barrier.

202
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Maybe it's trapped in the secret town.

203
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
What about Jin Ling?

204
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Is Jin Ling also trapped in the secret town?

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
If Jin Ling is outside, he won't be so anxious.

206
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
That makes sense.

207
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
But how are we going to get in?

208
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Wait!

209
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Wait!

210
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Jin Ling is definitely trapped in the secret town.

211
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,920
We must break through the barrier and get out of the secret town.

212
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Let's go.

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
How is it?

214
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
It's good.

215
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:45,920
There's a spirit here.

216
00:13:51,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Jin Ling is trapped in the secret town.

217
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Jin Ling.

218
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Jin Ling.

219
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Jin Ling.

220
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Jin Ling.

221
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Jin Ling.

222
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Jin Ling.

223
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Jin Ling.

224
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Jin Ling.

225
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Oh, no.

226
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Why are all the knives here?

227
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
What are you doing?

228
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm here to ask you.

229
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Where is it?

230
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
What's the use?

231
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Who made it?

232
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
What did he say?

233
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I don't know.

234
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
He said,

235
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I don't know.

236
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
That's good, Lan Zhan.

237
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Now you've learned how to steal me.

238
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I know this time.

239
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
He still said,

240
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I don't know.

241
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Right?

242
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
What did you ask him again?

243
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Why did he die?

244
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
But if he was killed by a man,

245
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I really don't know why he died.

246
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Lan Zhan,

247
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
why don't you ask him,

248
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
who killed him?

249
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Lan Zhan.

250
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
One is kept in this place.

251
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
One doesn't know where it is.

252
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Two doesn't know why he died.

253
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Three doesn't know who killed him.

254
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,920
That's the first time I've ever heard of a three-died spirit.

255
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Lan Zhan.

256
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Could it be that you're a three-died spirit?

257
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm kidding.

258
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Don't be like this.

259
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Lan Zhan,

260
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
why don't you ask him,

261
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
who killed him?

262
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
He doesn't know that, does he?

263
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Lan,

264
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
finally, you've got an answer.

265
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Lan Zhan,

266
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
ask him again,

267
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
is there a 15-year-old young man

268
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
who's been here?

269
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Yes.

270
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Where is he now?

271
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
He said,

272
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
he's here.

273
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
You mean,

274
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
he's in this stone castle?

275
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
But we searched it up just now,

276
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
and we didn't see it.

277
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Lan Zhan,

278
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
he's not lying to us, is he?

279
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm here,

280
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
I can't.

281
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Lan Zhan,

282
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
I'm here.

283
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Lan Zhan,

284
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm here.

285
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
What's the matter?

286
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
You're young,

287
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
how do you know each other?

288
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
How?

289
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
I'm 16 years old,

290
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
I know Lan Lin.

291
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
He's Jin Ling?

292
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Jin Ling,

293
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Jin Ling,

294
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Jin Ling!

295
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Jin Ling!

296
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Lan Zhan,

297
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
where is he?

298
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
He's in the far north,

299
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
facing the south.

300
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
He's thinking,

301
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
he's thinking,

302
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
he's thinking,

303
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
he's thinking.

304
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
The only thing he knows

305
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
is in front of you.

306
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Is he thinking?

307
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Jin Ling.

308
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Jin Ling.

309
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Jin Ling.

310
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Jin Ling.

311
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Jin Ling.

312
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Jin Ling.

313
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
Lan Zhan, look.

314
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Lan Zhan.

315
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
The monkey's feet,

316
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
the foot's feet,

317
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
are all in the west.

318
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Standing, sitting,

319
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
lying down,

320
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
squatting,

321
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
what is this place?

322
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
I'm not sure.

323
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Jin Ling.

324
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Lan Zhan,

325
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
this place is not a hotel.

326
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
There's a doctor outside.

327
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Go out and have a look.

328
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Lan Zhan, chase him.

329
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I'll chase him.

330
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
You and Jin Ling.

331
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
I'll take him to the road.

332
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
You go to the place where you found the monkey.

333
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
By the way,

334
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
there's a inn

335
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
in the corridor.

336
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Wait for me there.

337
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Chase him.

338
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
He's running away.

339
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
I'll go there.

340
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Lan Zhan,

341
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
be careful.

342
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Lan Zhan.

343
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Lan Zhan.

344
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Lan Zhan.

345
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
You look quite young.

346
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
You're quite smart.

347
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
The evil clan is cruel.

348
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Who will make the evil clan down?

349
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Or will they keep it in the food bag?

350
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Luckily, I didn't get the chest.

351
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
What are you doing?

352
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Why are you wearing my clothes?

353
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Where's my sword?

354
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Where's my dog?

355
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Why are you so nervous?

356
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
I've finally got you out of the wall.

357
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
You're not even saying thank you to me.

358
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
If I didn't see it,

359
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
you'd have died ten thousand times.

360
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
No.

361
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Listen to me.

362
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
It's enough to die once.

363
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Listen to me.

364
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Put down your sword.

365
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Jin Ling,

366
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
this jade pendant...

367
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
was left by my mother.

368
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Don't touch it.

369
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Xian.

370
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Later,

371
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
I found it in the study in Jia Zhong's room.

372
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I think it was left by him.

373
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Take it.

374
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
What are you doing?

375
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Why are you running?

376
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Jin Ling.

377
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
How dare you!

378
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
This kid is really so rude.

379
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
What?

380
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
I said you'd run away.

381
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Are you a big lady?

382
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
You're getting bigger and bigger.

383
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Oh, no.

384
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Jiang Cheng.

385
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I'm already back.

386
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Don't think about me.

387
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I'm not going to leave.

388
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I'm going to leave.

389
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
You're back?

390
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Don't think about me.

391
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
It's okay.

392
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Look at yourself.

393
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
I'm like a fool in your dog.

394
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
It's okay.

395
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
You're so embarrassed to wear your uniform.

396
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Go back and change.

397
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Tell me.

398
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Who did you meet today?

399
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I said I didn't meet anything.

400
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
I fell and ran away.

401
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
You can't catch me like this.

402
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
I'm not a three-year-old kid.

403
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I can't care about you.

404
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Listen to me.

405
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Even if you're thirty,

406
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
I can catch you.

407
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
If you dare to run away again,

408
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I'll kill you.

409
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
I just don't want to be helped.

410
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I don't want to be controlled.

411
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
That's why I went there alone.

412
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Don't mention it.

413
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Jiang Cheng Chi is a big lady.

414
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
He's a good guy.

415
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
So what now?

416
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
What did you catch?

417
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Where's the black-and-white dog you gave to you when you were a kid?

418
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
It must be a blue war.

419
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
I don't know where that guy went.

420
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
I don't want to be helped.

421
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Jiang Cheng Chi.

422
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Don't.

423
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Come on.

424
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
You killed me.

425
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
You killed yourself?

426
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Or do you want me to kill you with my own hands?

427
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
You...

429
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Don't you have anything to say to me?

430
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
I really don't know what to say to you.

431
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
You really don't know how to turn back.

432
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
You're so useless.

433
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Good.

434
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Then let's see.

435
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Who is useless?

436
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Who is useless?

437
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Who is useless?

438
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Who is useless?

439
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Who is useless?

440
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Who is useless?

441
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Master, where are you going?

442
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Xiao Jie.

443
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Who were you calling?

444
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
How dare you talk to her in front of me?

445
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
That's right.

446
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
You're a good guy.

447
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
You never need to go back.

448
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
You never have the chance to get along with those righteous people.

449
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
It's been 16 years.

450
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Lan Wang Ji still doesn't forget to protect you.

451
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,920
But he doesn't necessarily protect you.

452
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,920
After all, you've done a good thing with Wen Ning.

453
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
The people of Gusu Lan clan will never forget it.

454
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,920
People like him are so generous and generous.

455
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
How can they tolerate you?

456
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Maybe they're doing something to help you.

457
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Jiang Cheng, you should pay attention to Yan Ci.

458
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
I never pay attention to those.

459
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Did you forget?

460
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Of course.

461
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
You even made me pay attention to Yan Ci.

462
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
That day, on the mountain of Dafa,

463
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
did you pay attention to Jin Ling?

464
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
You really are a good girl.

465
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
You...

466
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
A good girl?

467
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
You're good at scolding.

468
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Do you really know how to scold?

469
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Jin Ling is being scolded by others today.

470
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
It's all your fault.

471
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
You and your family have forgotten everything.

472
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
You forgot what you said.

473
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
You forgot what you said.

474
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
But don't forget.

475
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,920
How did his parents die?

476
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
I didn't.

477
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
I just...

478
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
What did you just say?

479
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I just...

480
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
I can't say it.

481
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
It's okay.

482
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
You can go back to Lian Hua Wu.

483
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,920
And tell me everything about my mother.

484
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Is that right, Lian Hua?

485
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I was dreaming about Lian Hua Wu.

486
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
What are you doing there?

487
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Nothing.

488
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Where is she?

489
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Who?

490
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Wen Ning.

491
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Where is she?

492
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
I don't know.

493
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
You raised her.

494
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
You don't know?

495
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Do you think I'll believe you?

496
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
I don't care if you believe me or not.

497
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I really don't know where she is.

498
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Okay.

499
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
That day,

500
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,920
so many people saw you and her together in the mountain.

501
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Jiang Cheng.

502
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
It's been so long.

503
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Do you still hate her?

504
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Wei Wuxian.

505
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Do you think I hate her?

506
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
You even ask me if I hate her.

507
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
If it weren't for her,

508
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
would Jin Ziqiang die?

509
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Would my sister die?

510
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Or would you...

511
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
amos a narco.

512
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Jiang Cheng,

513
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
stop being jealous.

514
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Have you ever thought of

515
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,920
living till now?

516
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Uncle.

517
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Uncle.

518
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I told you to stay here. Why did you come here?

519
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
I have something important to tell you.

520
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
What is it? You didn't tell me just now.

521
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
You have to tell me now.

522
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
I thought you were scolding me.

523
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Did you hear me? I'm leaving.

524
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Get out of here.

525
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I really found out about that beast.

526
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
I think I met a warm mother.

527
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
When? Where?

528
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
This afternoon.

529
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
In a few miles from the south.

530
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
There was a broken house.

531
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
I heard there was a statue there.

532
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Who knew there was a person in there?

533
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

534
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm not sure.

535
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
That person is very fast.

536
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
You have a lot of skills.

537
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
You can only see a blurry shadow.

538
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,920
But I heard that the iron chain on her body was broken last time.

539
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
So I thought, would it be her?

540
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,920
If it wasn't for you, you would have scolded me.

541
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Otherwise, I would have told you when I came back.

542
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,920
So this time, if you didn't catch her,

543
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
you can only blame your temper.

544
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
You can't blame me.

545
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
I'll go back to your village.

546
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Get out of here.

547
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
You came back.

548
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
You didn't return to the Lotus Cove.

549
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Instead, you went to the murderer who killed Jin Zixuan.

550
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,920
She has become a ghost.

551
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
And I almost died.

552
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
What else do you want us to do?

553
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
What else?

554
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
I tell you.

555
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Even if you and her die a thousand times,

556
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
ten thousand times,

557
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,920
you can't bear the hatred in my heart.

558
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Jin family didn't get out of the city.

559
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
That's great.

560
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Today, I'll catch her and bring her to you.

561
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
And we'll go back to the wrong place together.

562
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Uncle.

563
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Uncle.

564
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Uncle.

565
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
Uncle.

566
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Uncle.

567
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Uncle.

568
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
You've already seen the person up there.

569
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
No matter what he says,

570
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
don't believe him.

571
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Don't listen to him.

572
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Don't let him make any sound.

573
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,920
If he dares to blow the whistle or the flute,

574
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
you'll block his mouth.

575
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
I know.

576
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
I can't even see a person.

577
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
You must watch him.

578
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
If I find out he's not here,

579
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
I'll break your leg.

580
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
You guys,

581
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
you guys, follow me.

582
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Yes, sir.

583
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
You two,

584
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
guard the door.

585
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
You two, guard the stairs.

586
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
Yes, sir.

587
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,920
My mom will come in.

588
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Go.

589
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Dog.

590
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Dog.

591
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Dog.

592
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Dog.

593
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Dog.

594
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
He's really not a dog.

595
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
He never wants anyone.

596
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Do you think he's a normal dog?

597
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Wait.

598
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
What's his name?

599
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Xing Ze.

600
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
His name.

601
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
You should call him that.

602
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
What's so strange about his name?

603
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
His name is Xiao Xian Zi.

604
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I can't call him that since I'm older.

605
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,920
The problem is not about whether he's big or small.

606
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,920
You must have learned this from Jiang Cheng.

607
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
How can you be so careless?

608
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Why do you care so much?

609
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
You offended my uncle.

610
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
You had to go to the hospital.

611
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Now that I let you go,

612
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
we're even.

613
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Jing Ling,

614
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
do you know

615
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
why your uncle wants to catch me?

616
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
I know.

617
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
He suspects you're Wei Wuxian.

618
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
What about you?

619
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Don't you suspect me?

620
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
My uncle used to be a good catcher.

621
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
He never let me go.

622
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Besides, Zi Dian didn't pull you out.

623
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I just think you're not.

624
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
I don't care who you are.

625
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
I just...

626
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
What?

627
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Even if you want to wear a mask,

628
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
don't wear a mask.

629
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
He's a shameless person.

630
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
He just...

631
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
We're even anyway.

632
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Let's go.

633
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Why are you still here?

634
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
I'll catch you when my uncle comes.

635
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Listen,

636
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
even if you save me,

637
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
I won't thank you.

638
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Don't let me tell you

639
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
what I'm worried about.

640
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Young people,

641
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,920
there are two things

642
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
to be said in one life.

643
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Two things?

644
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Thank you.

645
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
I just don't want to say it.

647
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
What can I do?

648
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,920
You'll cry one day.

649
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Jing Ling,

650
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
I'm sorry.

651
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
What?

652
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
On the mountain,

653
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm sorry for what I said to you.

654
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
It's nothing.

655
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
You're not the first person

656
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
to say that to me.

657
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
That's right.

658
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
I'm really not like that.

659
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
But I won't be worse than anyone

660
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
because of this.

661
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Anyway,

662
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
I want them to see it clearly.

663
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,920
I want to be much better than anyone.

664
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I want to be much better than anyone.

665
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Jiang Cheng,

666
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
listen to me.

667
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
I...

668
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
It's okay.

669
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
Some evil is cruel.

670
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
I can't explain it.

671
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
But I can tell who I am.

672
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
I'm sorry.

673
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,920
I'm sorry.

674
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
I'm sorry.

675
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm sorry.
