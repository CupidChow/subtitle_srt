1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,000
이라고

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
…

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,000
喎

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
你是帚

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
喵面

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
你是喵面

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
成都

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
你召我女儿名字干什么呀

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,560
Ha ha, big and small.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Miss Luo.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Lord Han.

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Childe Wei.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Miss Luo, this time

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,640
I finally know your real name.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,920
This is my husband.

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,080
Mr. Gowen, who is the family member?

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Why do you send people?

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
My husband is not from the Xuanmen Sect.

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,520
He used to be a businessman.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,240
But now he wants to go hunting with me.

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
You just went hunting?

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Yes.

52
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
We went to find the Yiling Lao Clan.

53
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
But I heard that

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,320
the Yiling Lao Clan will eat children.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Are you afraid?

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm not afraid.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,680
I...

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Childe Wei, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
The child is a little kid.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
This is my little girl.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,160
Her name is...

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
Mianmian, right?

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
So cute.

64
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
She looks the same as Miss Luo when she was a child.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Childe Wei,

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
isn't this a new word?

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,360
Do you really remember what I said when I was a child?

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Of course I do.

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
There's no change.

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,880
By the way, how old is she?

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll give her some money.

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,840
No need.

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,440
No need.

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,440
I didn't give her money anyway.

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Here you are.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Mianmian,

77
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,520
thank you for your help.

78
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Childe Wei.

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Thank you, Lord Han.

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Mianmian,

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,400
I gave you the money.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,760
Why don't you thank me?

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Miss Luo,

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
what's the reason for this?

85
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,440
I heard that

86
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,440
there are ghosts and monsters outside the city.

87
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
But I couldn't find the prey

88
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,000
after a night of hunting.

89
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Don't be afraid.

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Miss Luo,

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,040
protect Mianmian.

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
We'll be there in time.

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,640
Take care, Childe Wei.

94
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Goodbye.

95
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Tian'er,

96
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:52,880
when did you encounter

97
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
the danger of life?

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
By the way,

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Childe Wei saved your life.

100
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
But

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,680
I never heard you mention this person.

102
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Childe Wei?

103
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
It's just a good person.

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Let's go inside.

105
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Be careful.

106
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Wenning,

107
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
you haven't been cleaning for years.

108
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,160
You're getting more and more scary.

109
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm sorry, Childe.

110
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
I didn't scare you.

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Life is a disaster.

112
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
What's this?

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
How can you do this?

114
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Are you being beaten up?

115
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
What's wrong with your face?

116
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I... I've got a lot of dust on my face.

117
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I saw you guys

118
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
in there for a long time.

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
So...

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
You've been following us?

121
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Look at you.

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
You look like this.

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
What's wrong with your hand?

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Nothing.

125
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Blood?

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
No, it's blood.

127
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
It's blood.

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
But it's not human blood.

129
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
It's not human blood?

130
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
What are you fighting with?

131
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
It's all a disaster.

132
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
All a disaster?

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
You mean

134
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
you dare to destroy these things

135
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
in front of us?

136
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
When will you come to us?

137
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Jin Ling Tai.

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Wen Ning,

139
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
I told you

140
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
to hide in a place.

141
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Don't blame others.

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
But, Childe,

143
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
I...

144
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Where can I hide?

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Let's go.

146
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Follow us.

147
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Let's go together.

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Let's go.

149
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Let's go.

150
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Lan Zhan,

151
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
do you remember this town?

152
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I do.

153
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Do you remember

154
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
that we were still in this town?

155
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
You said you were going to Ye Lin.

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I said I wanted to treat you to dinner.

157
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Childe,

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:35,560
the new

159
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
is not a disaster.

160
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
You still bought the new.

161
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Yue, Yue,

162
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
come here.

163
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I don't want to.

164
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
I don't want to.

165
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Oh, no.

166
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
The mess is changing.

167
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Lan Zhan,

168
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
let's go.

169
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
It's all because of a long time ago.

170
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
If that child is still alive,

171
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
he should be more than ten years old.

172
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
No!

173
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
No!

174
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Don't mess with them.

175
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Go up the mountain.

176
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Go up the mountain.

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
The wall is broken.

178
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Someone is going up the mountain.

179
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Go up the mountain.

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
The wall is broken.

181
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Childe,

182
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
this is my own magnificent.

183
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Try it.

184
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Yue,

185
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
run slowly.

186
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Don't fall.

187
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Young master, it's my fault.

188
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Sorry, thank you.

189
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Young master Wei.

190
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Young master Wei.

191
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Young master Wei.

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm back.

193
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Young master Wei.

194
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I'll be back.

195
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
No matter what you say to me,

196
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
or ask them,

197
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,560
this place is the most beautiful time of our lives.

198
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Why do you have to go back?

199
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Wen Ning.

200
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Stop looking.

201
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Let's go.

202
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I know, young master.

203
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
I just want to see

204
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
if there's anything left.

205
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Be careful.

206
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Master.

207
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Thank you.

208
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I haven't seen you for a long time.

209
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I'm not used to it.

210
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Okay, I'll tell you.

211
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Actually, I'm weak now.

212
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
So even if it's a good thing,

213
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
I can't show her real power.

214
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,560
So, I still have to ask Han Guangjun

215
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
to protect me.

216
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Wait.

217
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
I said

218
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
you shouldn't have only taught her a lesson.

219
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Why didn't you learn her lesson?

220
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
She left her family in the first place.

221
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
She left her family in the first place.

222
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
They've been away for a few days.

227
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
What do you want?

228
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Kill them and give them a pain relief.

229
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
I'd rather be bitten by a monster than die.

230
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't want to starve to death.

231
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
What else can you do?

232
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
I want to be like Hu Yetian.

233
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
I want to make us his puppet

234
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
and deal with our family.

235
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I want them to kill themselves

236
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
without a word.

237
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
I want to be a puppet.

238
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I want to be a puppet.

239
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
I want to be a puppet.

240
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Shut up.

241
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Shut up?

242
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
What do you mean?

243
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
What do you mean?

244
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Are you deaf or dumb?

245
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Do you understand?

246
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Shut up.

247
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Just shut up.

248
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Why do you let me shut up?

249
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
What's the point of talking nonsense here?

250
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
The car can break down.

251
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
You're listening to me.

252
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
You...

253
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Stop arguing.

254
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
We're trapped here.

255
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
There are so many ghosts on the mountain.

256
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
I don't know when they'll come in.

257
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Are you going to argue with me?

258
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
He's the one who's the first one to get mad.

259
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
What?

260
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
You can scold me, but not me.

261
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Jingliang, who do you think you are?

262
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
You think you can be the most virtuous person in the world?

263
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
You're the one who's the last one to get mad.

264
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't need to talk.

265
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
I'll see what you can do to me.

266
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
You want to fight?

267
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Fine, I'll let you go.

268
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm on fire.

269
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
You're a good girl.

270
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
You're a good girl.

271
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Stop fighting.

272
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Calm down.

273
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Calm down.

274
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Calm down.

275
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Are you still fighting?

276
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Stop fighting.

277
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Jingliang.

278
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Jingliang.

279
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Look at this.

280
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Lord Han Guang.

281
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Lord Han Guang.

282
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
What are you happy about?

283
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
They're on fire.

284
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
General.

285
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
General.

286
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
General.

287
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
General.

288
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
It turns out that I'm not as good as you

289
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
in terms of the formation.

290
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Run!

291
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Run!

292
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
No!

293
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
There's no more lightning!

294
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Lord Wei.

295
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Are you here to save us?

296
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
You didn't send someone to catch us, did you?

297
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Me?

298
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Don't you know how poor I am?

299
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
How can I be able to care for them?

300
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I've known that you're really poor.

301
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Good girl.

302
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
How many people are there?

303
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Is there anyone nearby?

304
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Several people.

305
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
They both have their own faces.

306
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
They're all looking for their noses.

307
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,960
There are several people on the other side.

308
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,200
They are all covered with the Ghost Face.

309
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,560
They can't see the face.

310
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,840
They just leave us here.

311
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
They don't care.

312
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,240
They want us to be alone.

313
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, right.

314
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
There seems to be a lot of ghosts out there.

315
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
They keep calling us.

316
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Well done.

317
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,040
Well done.

318
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,520
Even the Four Tricks will fight.

319
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,120
Just now...

320
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,720
Just now, it was a mistake.

321
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Mr. Qin.

322
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,240
What are you doing?

323
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,000
You are like the Diorohan.

324
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Han Zhan.

325
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,840
Don't you want to give him another chance?

326
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,520
I...

327
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,360
Jing Yin.

328
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Okay.

329
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,440
Can we go out first?

330
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Yes.

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
What?

332
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,320
You still want to stay here?

333
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,080
There are so many ghosts out there.

334
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,960
You want us to go out?

335
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,160
You want to die?

336
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,080
Mr. Qin.

337
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,280
I will drive them all away.

338
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,160
The door is already opened.

339
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,960
We can't just break out of here.

340
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
If you don't leave,

341
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,080
we will be in trouble after we leave.

342
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,920
Look at the shape of the mountain.

343
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,560
Don't you want to be on the edge?

344
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Let's go.

345
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,160
Han Zhan, let's go.

346
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,240
What's going on?

347
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Nothing.

348
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,720
Jin Ling, come here.

349
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Uncle.

350
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Uncle.

351
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,800
Wen Ning, don't go out.

352
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Dad.

353
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,320
Jin Ling, what are you doing?

354
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,720
Are you waiting for death?

355
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
Han Zhan.

356
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Han Luo.

357
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Go.

358
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Dad.

359
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,920
Dad, the door is open.

360
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Dad.

361
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Wang Ji, come here.

362
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Han Guang Jun.

363
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
What's wrong with you?

364
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,520
You are not here.

365
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,120
You have been disloyal to him.

366
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,120
What can you do to him?

367
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
You have been standing in our team.

368
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,720
You are so stubborn.

369
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,520
You are being too much.

370
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
You are here again.

371
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
You are being too much.

372
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
You are being too much.

373
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
You are being too much.

374
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
You are being too much.

375
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
You are being too much.

376
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
You are here again.

377
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
Of course I am here.

378
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
If it's not because the old team just came back,

379
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
they are afraid that the world will not know.

380
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,920
The great master Qi Gu's creation, Kui Lei,

381
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,720
has captured the Zidi of the Zhong family.

382
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,520
It's not faster than me.

383
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,120
He came to the imperial court again.

384
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
I saved these Zidi of the family.

385
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Why don't you thank me?

386
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
You have to control me.

387
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
What's wrong with you?

388
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Why are you sleeping?

389
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
But,

390
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,520
the town you came to is a bit too crowded.

391
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
There are two great men missing.

392
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
I can ask you all.

393
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Why didn't Zewu Jun and Lian Fangzun come?

394
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
A few days ago,

395
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Lian Fangzun was assassinated by an unknown person in Jinling Tai.

396
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
He was seriously injured.

397
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Zewu Jun is still in power.

398
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Why do you ask?

399
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Why are you laughing?

400
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Nothing.

401
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I just feel that

402
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Lian Fangzun is easily injured.

403
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Father,

404
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,520
I think it's really not him.

405
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Last time, he saved us in the city.

406
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
He seems to be here to save us this time.

407
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Little kid, don't talk nonsense.

408
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Do you know what's going on here?

409
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Do you know who you are?

410
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Why didn't Qing He come?

411
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
I've seen him.

412
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Well, Wei,

413
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I really don't know anything.

414
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm just here to check the numbers.

415
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Wei Wuxian, do you still remember me?

416
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
I don't remember.

417
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
You don't remember?

418
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
I can remember this leg.

419
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
My leg was

420
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
spent on the money you spent on Buye Tian.

421
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I just want to tell you that

422
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I'm using my power to defend you

423
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
in so many people.

424
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm so proud of you.

425
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Wei Wuxian,

426
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
I don't know if you remember me.

427
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,520
My parents died in your hands.

428
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
You owe so much to blood debt.

429
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,520
You must not remember them.

430
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm not going to marry you.

431
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
But I won't forget them.

432
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
I won't forgive them.

433
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,520
I hurt your leg.

434
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
I killed your parents

435
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,520
and killed your family.

436
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Why are you here?

437
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
I'm here to fight for you.

438
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm here to make you understand.

439
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I'm not a coward.

440
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm just here to defend you.

441
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
No matter what you do,

442
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
no matter how many times you come back,

443
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
I'll send you back.

444
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
I'll do anything else.

445
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Just for one reason.

446
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Yes.

447
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,520
We're here to kill Wei Wuxian.

448
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,520
We're here to kill Wei Wuxian.

449
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
We're here to kill Wei Wuxian.

450
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
We're here to kill Wei Wuxian.

451
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
You're not going to marry me!

452
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
You're not going to marry me!

453
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,520
My son died in the prison.

454
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Liar!

455
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
You can't marry me!

456
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,520
In the late night, there are indeed more than 3,000 people in the scene.

457
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,520
But there are also several families in the scene,

458
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,520
and all the elite soldiers.

459
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,520
With these people here,

460
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,520
can I really kill all these 3,000 people?

461
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Are you looking down on me or not looking down on them?

462
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Wei Wuxian, what are you talking about?

463
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Can you still fight in the snow?

464
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I don't want to fight in this world.

465
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I don't want to be a burden to others.

466
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,520
I can just add my own crimes.

467
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
I didn't do it.

468
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I don't want to be a burden.

469
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
It's not what you did.

470
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
What else is it that you didn't do?

471
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I currently have no evidence for the Qiong Qi Tao and the Buye Tian.

472
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
But I can tell you that

473
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I didn't do the Chifeng Zun's harm.

474
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I didn't force the lady of Jinling Tai to commit suicide.

475
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
And all the ghosts you've encountered along the way

476
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
are not under my control.

477
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Yiling Laozu,

478
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
I only heard that you're a crazy man.

479
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
I didn't expect that you're so cunning.

480
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
If it weren't for you,

481
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
I wouldn't have thought that

482
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
there are so many ghosts in this world

483
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
that can control so many ghosts.

484
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
You forced us to be so despicable.

485
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
What's there that you can't figure out?

486
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
With the Eagle Tiger's Blessing,

487
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
anyone can do it.

488
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
The Eagle Tiger's Blessing is not your magic?

489
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm just going to ask,

490
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
who is the one who loves her so much?

491
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
It's like Wenming.

492
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Some families are afraid of the Ghost General,

493
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
and they're afraid of dying.

494
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
They shout at him and kill him.

495
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,520
But they've been hiding him for over ten years.

496
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
That's strange.

497
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Who is it?

498
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Tell me, it's already been lost.

499
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,520
You don't have to act like a ghost.

500
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,920
apan

501
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Everybody, be careful.

502
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
The Erstrais' Village is here.

503
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
What's wrong with me?

504
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
My spirit power is gone!

505
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

506
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I'm in a hurry.

507
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
What's going on?

508
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
My spirit power is gone!

509
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
What's going on?

510
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
I'm in a hurry.

511
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
What's going on?

512
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
I'm in a hurry.

513
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
What's going on?

514
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Everyone, come here!

515
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Help the fire department to get inside.

516
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
There's a big formation on the ground.

517
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
We should be able to block it.

518
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
We can't go in.

519
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
This must be a critical moment in the room.

520
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
There must be a more dangerous trap waiting for us.

521
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
It's also dead outside.

522
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
It's also dead inside.

523
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
It's all dead inside.

524
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
We can still get in.

525
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Chief Su, you're in a hurry to let everyone die with you.

526
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
What do you mean?

527
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Hey, are you guys leaving?

528
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
If you don't leave, I'll leave.

529
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Hurry up, let's go.

530
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Let's go, Di.

531
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
If they want to harm us, we'll have to.

532
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Hurry up and get in.

533
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
There's a big formation here.

534
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Chief Su, you're still not in?

535
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
It's getting better.

536
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
You're staying here?

537
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
You're really brave.

538
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Stop!

539
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Come in!

540
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
How did I get in?

541
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
You're still not in?

542
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
What's going on?

543
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Uncle.

544
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
What's wrong?

545
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
What's wrong?

546
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
What's wrong?

547
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
What's wrong?

548
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
You're not in?

549
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Why don't we come in together?

550
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
We're not in.

551
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
We're not in.

552
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
We're not in.

553
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Why are you guys not in?

554
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
I don't believe you.

555
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Don't you want to know why you're poisoned?

556
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Poison?

557
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
Poison?

558
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
You're so kind.

559
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
I'm not that capable.

560
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I can't believe you guys are poisoned.

561
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
That's right.

562
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
I think he's right.

563
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Right?

564
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,520
I guess you guys didn't come to eat together before the fight.

565
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,520
So you guys shouldn't be poisoned.

566
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,520
I've never heard of poison that can make people suddenly lose their mental strength.

567
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Otherwise, this kind of poison would have been absorbed by the world by the world.

568
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
It would have caused a lot of trouble.

569
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Right.

570
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Doctor!

571
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Doctor!

572
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Come and see me.

573
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
Poison is still alive or dead?

574
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Yes.

575
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
You guys should rest well.

576
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Don't worry.

577
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
It's still alive.

578
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
How long is it?

579
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
When can we recover?

580
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
I'm afraid at least two hours.

581
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Two hours?

582
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Two hours?

583
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,520
How can we recover after two hours?

584
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
I don't know.

585
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Brother Wei, how should we recover now?

586
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,520
I told you not to look at me.

587
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
There are only two people here who are still alive.

588
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
I'm Lan Zhan.

589
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,520
These few days ago, I was caught by a kid who came to the mountain.

590
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,520
I'm not going to be a burden to the rest of the people.

591
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,520
If I want to do anything to you,

592
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
can these kids be able to stop me?

593
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Cut the crap.

594
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
If you want to kill, then kill.

595
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
If anyone in the arena wants to teach,

596
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
it's not a good idea to be a hero.

597
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Right.

598
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Don't expect others to be so angry with you.

599
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Let me ask you.

600
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Who are you?

601
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
You.

602
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
And then?

603
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Not poison.

604
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
And then?

605
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
And then?

606
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,520
People won't suddenly lose their spiritual power, right?

607
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,520
There must be a path or a miracle.

608
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Is there anyone willing to think about it?

609
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,520
What have you all done?

610
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
By the way,

611
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,520
did we drink water when we were on the mountain?

612
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
I can't remember.

613
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I don't know.

614
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
There's no one in the mountain to drink water.

615
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Who dares to drink water in the river?

616
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Yes.

617
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Who's drinking water?

618
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,520
That's the weapon that's absorbed into the mountain.

619
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
That's possible.

620
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
No way.

621
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
The weapon is even more powerful on the mountain.

622
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
But we've been tied up on the mountain for two days.

623
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Ling Ling is still around.

624
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Enough.

625
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Everyone is still discussing with him.

626
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,520
It's interesting to be dragged by the enemy.

627
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
He...

628
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Say it.

629
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
Why didn't you say it?

630
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Chief.

631
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Chief.

632
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
What's going on?

633
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Wei Wuxian, what kind of magic are you doing?

634
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
It's not a magic.

635
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
It's a magic tree.

636
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Go on.

637
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
It's so strange.

638
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Senior Wei, what's so strange?

639
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
This one, Chief Su.

640
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
He's been acting strange since just now.

641
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
When the puppet was coming up,

642
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
he tried to protect the person who was in the forest.

643
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
He didn't want to beg.

644
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
He wanted to die together.

645
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Now he's trying to block my mouth.

646
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
He doesn't want me to be questioned.

647
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
And he's still angry.

648
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
He's afraid that you'll live longer.

649
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
What's the point?

650
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
How can I be a friend like this?

651
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,520
Looks like the relationship between you and Gusulan

652
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
is really bad.

653
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Of course it's bad.

654
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Gusulan is the one

655
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
who separated from him.

656
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
What's going on?

657
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
I didn't know that

658
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,520
he was the one who secretly protected

659
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
the person who was in the forest.

660
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Their secret is similar to Gusulan's.

661
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
And they are both from the forest.

662
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Even the family's spirit,

663
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,520
they are all similar to the one who was in the forest.

664
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
What's the point?

665
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
It's clear that they betrayed Lan's family

666
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
and were expelled from the family.

667
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
It's not just that.

668
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
It's even better to call him a man of the past.

669
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Chief Su.

670
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Alright, I know what to say.

671
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Chief Su is not only good at writing,

672
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
but also someone else said

673
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
that he's learned from our Han Guang Jun.

674
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Otherwise, he'd turn the tide immediately.

675
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
Jingyi, what's wrong with him?

676
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
How can he do that?

677
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
How can he do that?

678
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
A Gusulan who is a good servant,

679
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
and he's a good man.

680
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
He's the best student in the school.

681
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
So he's the one who taught his students.

682
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Chief Su,

683
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
now that the enemy is here,

684
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
how can we be more angry than our own people?

685
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Our own people?

686
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Look at them, Gusulan

687
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
is all a group of Wei Wuxian.

688
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
What are they?

689
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Song Mingshan,

690
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
even if you are not

691
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
a Gusulan,

692
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
you can be more serious.

693
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Our Chief Su has already removed

694
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
your Gusulan.

695
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Why are you

696
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
talking to him like that?

697
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
You have the position now.

698
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
You are not

699
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
taught by our Gusulan.

700
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Well,

701
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
we'll talk about it

702
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
after we're back.

703
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
There are so many Gusulan students.

704
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Can't everyone

705
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
be more self-reliant?

706
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
You are too arrogant.

707
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Acquaintance?

708
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
Who is arrogant?

709
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
I don't know

710
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
who's the one who's

711
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
the one who's the one who's the one

712
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one.

713
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
I don't think so.

714
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
It's not a weapon,

715
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
it's not a food.

716
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
You all forgot that

717
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
after we went up the mountain,

718
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
you all did the same thing.

719
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
What's that?

720
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Killing the Kuei Lei?

721
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Enough.

722
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
If we kill Kuei Lei,

723
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
what's the point?

724
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
We can't

725
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
find out.

726
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
It's indeed related to killing Kuei Lei.

727
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
But this problem

728
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
is not about Kuei Lei,

729
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,520
but about the person who killed Kuei Lei.

730
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Senior Lan,

731
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
there's a question.

732
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I want to ask you a question.

733
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
What's the problem?

734
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
You won't ask him,

735
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
but you still want to ask me?

736
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Then I'll ask you.

737
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
Lan Zhan.

738
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Although the Mo Ling Su family

739
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,520
separated from the Gu Sulan family,

740
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
the Mo Ling Su family's

741
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
determination is still the same as the Gu Sulan family.

742
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Is that so?

743
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Yes.

744
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
One of the secrets of the Gu Sulan family

745
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
is that it has a cause of destruction

746
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
and a small effect of a repulsion.

747
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
The most dangerous thing is the Qin family.

748
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
So the people who repressed Qin

749
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
are the most.

750
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
The Mo Ling Su family has a school.

751
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
So their family is also the most repressed.

752
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Right?

753
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Yes.

754
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Although the family members of the Mo Ling Su family

755
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
separated from the Gu Sulan family,

756
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
they were self-sufficient.

757
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Because of their own Qin family,

758
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
they didn't have a good fortune.

759
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
So the door to their family

760
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
was also exposed, right?

761
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
Yes.

762
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
That means

763
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
even when they were on the battlefield

764
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
to kill the puppet,

765
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
the Mo Ling Su family's battle song

766
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
was a melody that was not right.

767
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
The Gu Sulan family

768
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
would be weird and not weird.

769
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
They would only think that

770
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
they made a mistake

771
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
and made a mistake.

772
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
But they wouldn't notice

773
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
that they were talking about the mistake

774
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
on purpose or on purpose.

775
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Is that so?

776
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Chief Su.

777
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
What are you doing?

778
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Don't you forget that

779
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
you are now a spiritual master.

780
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Is it useful for you to threaten me?

781
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
You are really trying to get me back.

782
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
What are you trying to do with the Han Sha Shui?

783
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Am I being too harsh?

784
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,520
So you think I'm in the Han Sha Shui?

785
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Fine.

786
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I'll make it clear.

787
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Everyone here lost their spiritual power

788
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
because of the killing puppet.

789
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
When killing the puppet,

790
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Chief Su and you two went up the mountain together.

791
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
Pretending to be the demon of the jade,

792
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
you were already confused

793
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
and changed the battle song

794
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
into another part

795
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
that would temporarily lose the spiritual power.

796
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
You two fought in the jade blood.

797
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
You two fought on the surface.

798
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,520
But you were killed by the underground.

799
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
You still want to get back together?

800
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
There are many of the Gu Sulan family's

801
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
singing and dancing in the battle.

802
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
When you went up the mountain,

803
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
did you make the wrong

804
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
melody for the Mo Ling Su family's battle song?

805
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
That's right.

806
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
This Chief Su

807
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
knows that many of the Gu Sulan family's

808
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
people have been distressed by you

809
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
and the Mo Ling Su family.

810
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
So you used this distrust.

811
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
Even if you made a mistake,

812
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
among all the family members,

813
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
only the Gu Sulan family could hear it.

814
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
But the Gu Sulan family

815
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
didn't care about you at all.

816
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Even if you made a mistake,

817
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
you just think that

818
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
you were just being careless.

819
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
There is such a simple melody in the world.

820
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
If you listen to it,

821
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
you will lose the spiritual power.

822
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
Why not?

823
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Why can't the Qin people retreat?

824
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Why can't they recruit the Xie?

825
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
There is a song called

826
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,520
The Wanderer's Wanderer's Wander.

827
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
It can be recorded

828
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
and changed the melody.

829
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
It can kill people in a formless form.

830
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
If you don't believe me,

831
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
you can ask Mr. Lan Qi Ren.

832
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,520
The Yun Shen is not familiar with the forbidden book.

833
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Is there this book?

834
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
Even if there is such a song,

835
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
when I was studying in the Gu Sulan family,

836
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
I couldn't remember the forbidden book.

837
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Who said that you can go in there yourself?

838
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
You can freely enter and out.

839
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
I guess

840
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
he taught you

841
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
how to change the melody.

842
00:43:36,520 --> 00:44:06,520
The Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's

843
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's Wanderer's W

844
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,800
A hundred years of years of sorrow...

845
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,960
What will destiny bring us to?

846
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,240
Than how daathon-traditional!

847
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,940
This is our aman SIAS

848
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:03,320
A hundred years of years of sorrow...

849
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,260
What happens if you're willing to listen for me?

850
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:20,760
Why not being hold dear to others just toлагh the world
