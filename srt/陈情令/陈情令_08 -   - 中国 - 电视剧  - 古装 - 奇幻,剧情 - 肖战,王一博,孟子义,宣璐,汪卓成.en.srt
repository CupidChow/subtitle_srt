00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 08

3
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,400
Wen Ning!

4
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,840
Wen Ning!

5
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,960
Wen Ning!

6
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,600
Here I come!

7
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,080
He's just gone.

8
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
Little rabbit, little rabbit.

9
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,480
Pets are not allowed in Cloud Recesses.

10
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,320
Thus I can only hide you here.

11
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you happy living here?

12
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,320
Happy.

13
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,960
OK.

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm content to hear that.

15
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
Little rabbits,

16
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
should I take you back to Lotus Cove?

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,040
No. No. No.

18
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,280
If Lan Zhan feels lonely one day and come here,

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,760
he can't find you then.

20
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,520
However...

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,120
Take care, Wangji.

22
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Little rabbits,

23
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,000
where will he go by himself?

24
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,880
Can't he go to find the Yin Iron alone, can he?

25
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,040
Eh? You think so?

26
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
Lan Zhan, you stubborn.

27
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,600
You're all present that day.

28
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
You should have seen it all.

29
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
In the name of my grandmaster,

30
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
we found that Yin Iron

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,880
together!

32
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
Now he is to search it

33
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
leaving me alone.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
You guys judge by reason.

35
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,040
Isn't he so disloyal to friends?

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
Xian.

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Senior Sister.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
How cute they are!

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
What are you doing secretly here?

40
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
None of your business.

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,600
As an upright gentleman,

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
It's embarrassing for you to hold the rabbit.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah.

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,880
As an upright gentleman,

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,680
how embarrassing... for me to hold a rabbit!

46
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
What the hell!

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
Little rabbit.

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,040
Why do you keep these little ones?

49
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,360
Will it be...

50
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
that you want to eat them?

51
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,440
What are you talking about, Jiang Cheng?

52
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
They shouldn't hear such a chat.

53
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,840
I found them accidentally.

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,880
You can't keep pets in Cloud Recesses.

55
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,240
Where did you find them?

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,840
None of your business.

57
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Senior Sister,

58
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,960
if you like,

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,520
we can take one back.

60
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
But if we take one back,

61
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,560
we are making him separate from

62
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,560
his families and loved ones.

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,080
How can he be happy then?

64
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
Right.

65
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, it's getting late, let's return.

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,600
Alright.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Little rabbits,

68
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
we have to go now.

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go.

70
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
- Ok. - Go.

71
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Wait for me!

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,680
Farewell.

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Childe Wen.

74
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,680
Please come in since you are here.

75
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,640
Amazing hearing, Clan Leader Lan.

76
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
Coming at such a late time,

77
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,560
what can I do for you, Childe Wen?

78
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,360
Wen Qing told me

79
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,320
the back hill of Lan clan is strictly guarded.

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,320
Is there any treasure hidden ?

81
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,520
The back hill

82
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,240
is where our progenitors lay.

83
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,840
We guard it in case it is offended by strangers.

84
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,960
If so,

85
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I'd like to offer sacrifices to your progenitors.

86
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,720
May I be allowed in, Clan Leader Lan?

87
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,120
Childe Wen,

88
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
please go back.

89
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,280
Lan Xichen,

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,720
don't think we can do nothing,

91
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
because your spiritual power is high.

92
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,080
Although I can do nothing now,

93
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
don't forget that,

94
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,480
Lan Wangji just set off without any company.

95
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,000
Lan Xichen,

96
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,790
turn in the Yin Iron as soon as possible,

97
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,200
so that your clan would survive.

98
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,280
Wangji,

99
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,760
please take care.

100
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,240
Gone for the night hunt.

101
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,640
Wei Wuxian, you schmuck!

102
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Bastard!

103
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,040
How could he leave without a goodbye?

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,280
What happened?

105
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,720
Dad, look at this.

106
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Dad, I'll go to take him back.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,760
No need.

108
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
We head back to Yunmeng first.

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Why?

110
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,800
How can we leave him alone?

111
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
Don't worry.

112
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,840
Xian knows what to do.

113
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
He left without a goodbye.

114
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,840
It must be that he was in an urgent situation.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
What can be so urgent?

116
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,960
Get ready.

117
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's leave first.

118
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Lan Zhan.

119
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,000
Boring.

120
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,240
Lan Zhan.

121
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,680
How could you break the promise.

122
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
We said to share the chivalric duty together.

123
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,760
How could you leave alone?

124
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,680
It can't be that you're afraid

125
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,600
I'll steal your show in punishing the evil and aid the weak ?

126
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,840
I didn't expect you people of Lan clan

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,240
can be so petty.

128
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,920
Boring.

129
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,680
What did you say?

130
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm boring?

131
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,000
Lan Zhan. Wait for me!

132
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
Lan Zhan.

133
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,760
This is my self-created talisman.

134
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,160
It can keep people within 4 meters.

135
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
How about it? Is it fun?

136
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,000
What should I name it?

137
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,240
Should it be Binding

138
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
or Bonding?

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Maybe neither.

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,520
How about calling it...

141
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,320
Boring.

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,720
Lan Zhan! Wait!

143
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,480
The Iron is responding.

144
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,040
Maybe it has perceived something.

145
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,080
There may be another Yin Iron nearby.

146
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,160
You mean here?

147
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,360
What?

148
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,960
Never mind.

149
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,760
Lan Zhan!

150
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,000
Scared?

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Wei Wuxian.

152
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,480
Nie Huaisang.

153
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,880
Why are you here?

154
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
On hearing the laughter,

155
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,800
I knew it was you, Bro Wei.

156
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,560
Bro Nie,

157
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,160
didn't you tell your Clan Leader Nie

158
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,680
you'd return to Qinghe once the lecture was over?

159
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,920
Bro Wei, you are the same.

160
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,680
Shouldn't you have returned

161
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,680
to Lotus Cove with your Clan Leader Jiang?

162
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,400
You arrogant.

163
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,720
He...

164
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,600
Don't be nervous. It's OK.

165
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,800
- He is the... - Let's talk along the way.

166
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
Cheng.

167
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
Be careful.

168
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,760
Bro Wei,

169
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
why are you with this Second Childe Lan?

170
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,920
I thought you two were incompatible.

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,160
It's a long story.

172
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,440
I got it.

173
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,640
It must be a punishment from the old Master Lan.

174
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
You must have violated their family rules again.

175
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,120
Our relationship is much better now.

176
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,640
What does it say?

177
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Don't push.

178
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,520
What's over there?

179
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,760
Have a look?

180
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,560
Go.

181
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,400
Lan Zhan, why don't you move?

182
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,240
No. Too crowded.

183
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
It's OK. Not that crowded.

184
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,680
Come on. Let's go see it.

185
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Let's go.

186
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,240
Come on.

187
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,920
This childe,

188
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
what are you looking at? What happened?

189
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
You didn't know?

190
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,280
This is an invitation.

191
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,400
Lately,

192
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,640
that seclusive Lady Florist

193
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,400
suddenly invited all cultivators

194
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,560
to her mansion for a verse party.

195
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,240
If any cultivator who is elegant and brilliant in poetry attend

196
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Lady Florist will greet and treat him in person.

197
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,000
Lady Florist...

198
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
I remember that

199
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,600
I read about her in "The Florist Lady and The Flower Phantom".

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
In a garden in Tanzhou

201
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,800
lives a florist lady who often recites poems by moonlight.

202
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,520
Whose poems can move her will be granted a flower.

203
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,960
The flower lasts for three years and its aroma is forever.

204
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,280
Bro Nie,

205
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,240
you are such a talent.

206
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,920
As for the homework assignedv by the old Master Lan,

207
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,640
You couldn't even recall one word of that.

208
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,960
However you are really good at such anecdotes.

209
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,280
Bro Wei, aren't you the same?

210
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,880
So beautiful!

211
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,200
Bro Wei, look!

212
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,680
The Second Childe Lan

213
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,360
is nothing but an unparalleled

214
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,520
gorgeous and elegant gentleman.

215
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
Agree.

216
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,680
But he dresses all in white like in a  funeral.

217
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,440
The Yin Iron.

218
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,560
It seems we are late again.

219
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
The Dire Owl.

220
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
It's Wen Chao.

221
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,640
Wen Chao has been here.

222
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,320
Now I see.

223
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,000
The Yin Iron

224
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,120
depraved the peony, the leading flower,

225
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,240
and the true Lady Florist was held in captivity.

226
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,960
The fake one invited all cultivators

227
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,760
to find other shards of the Yin Iron.

228
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,960
True.

229
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,160
Bro Wei,

230
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,120
the Yin Iron is really so powerful?

231
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,840
Of course.

232
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120
How about

233
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,960
letting Second Childe Lan

234
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
show you his.

235
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,840
No. No need.

236
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,480
Bro Wei,

237
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,200
we are holding such a Yin Iron.

238
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,320
Isn't it very dangerous?

239
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,280
Not us.

240
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,840
It's me and him.

241
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
- Bro Wei. - Me and him.

242
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
At least you should return to Qinghe with me.

243
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,480
Look, how dangerous it is along the road.

244
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm afr...

245
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,200
Bro Wei! Bro Wei!

246
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
The Dire Owl.

247
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,840
It again.

248
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,560
Hurry.

249
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,040
Bro Wei!

250
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,720
Are you going to Qinghe or not?

251
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
Bro Wei, wait for me!

252
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Childe,

253
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,640
His Excellency has ordered that

254
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,040
as nothing happens in Yueyang for days

255
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
we shall hurry there as soon as possible

256
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,080
to help Xue Yang.

257
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,680
Help?

258
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,640
Xue Yang is nothing.

259
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
He is not worthy my help.

260
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm just transmitting the order.

261
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,680
Don't put on an act before me.

262
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
You think I don't know?

263
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,120
You just don't want me

264
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,800
to cause trouble for Wei and Lan.

265
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,680
What?

266
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,320
After months of lecture you are attached to them?

267
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,080
A word of advice.

268
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,280
Don't intimidate me with His Excellency!

269
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,080
Once I get the Yin Iron from Lan Wangji

270
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
plus the one I got from Lady Florist,

271
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,040
I'll contribute the most to His Excellency.

272
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,400
Xue Yang with only one shard is no match for me.

273
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,960
Oh, I almost forgot if you weren't here.

274
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Dafan Mountain

275
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,840
is where you were born, right?

276
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,920
What do you want?

277
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,280
I want nothing.

278
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
But on their way to Qinghe,

279
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Wei Wuxian and his companions

280
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,680
will definitely pass by this place.

281
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,280
His Excellency has promised me.

282
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,000
None of my people will be harmed again.

283
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,240
Don't worry.

284
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,240
As long as you listen to me,

285
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,080
nobody will get into trouble.

286
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,120
Let's pay a visit to that cannibal monster.

287
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,680
- Tastes not bad.  - Pretty good.

288
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,120
Let's eat.

289
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,920
Miss Wen,

290
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,760
the alcohol is overflowing.

291
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Waiter, any fine room left?

292
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,040
Yes.

293
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,560
Miss Wen,

294
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
why are you here?

295
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,000
Sit, please.

296
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
Waiter, two buns please.

297
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,520
OK, please wait a sec.

298
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
Waiter, two buns too please.

299
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,680
Got it, please wait a sec.

300
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,080
Waiter, a pot of Pear Flower White.

301
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,720
OK, give me a sec.

302
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
Waiter, a pot of Pear Flower White too.

303
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,600
Understood.

304
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,920
Waiter, hurry up.

305
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,000
Serve ours first.

306
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,720
Customer, this is...

307
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,560
Waiter, let them have that then.

308
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,120
This is...

309
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,600
We don't want now. Throw that away.

310
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,440
What do you mean? Making fun of me?

311
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Inn keeper, look at them.

312
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
Wen clan of Qishan is deliberately making fun of you.

313
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,720
So what?

314
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,120
Stop there.

315
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,240
Dafan Mountain. Wei is in danger.

316
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,440
Much obliged.

317
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,960
Never mind.

318
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,880
Disaster from the peri snatch spirit and take the soul.

319
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
Look, there is an old woman.

320
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,120
Let's ask her.

321
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
Maybe we are able to put up for a night.

322
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,440
Disaster from the peri snatch spirit and take the soul.

323
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,520
Madam.

324
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,000
=Mrs Wen

325
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,560
We are passing by and in need of a place for rest.

326
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
Can we stay in your place for the night?

327
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,000
Madam?

328
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,440
Madam?

329
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,520
We need to find

330
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,840
a place to sleep here.

331
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,520
Sleep.

332
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,400
Do you understand sleep?

333
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,400
Sleep.

334
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,040
Madam.

335
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,440
Madam.

336
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,280
Let's go.

337
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,880
What?

338
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Hard to say.

339
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,440
I just have a bad feeling

340
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,760
Madam.

341
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,320
Madam.

342
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,920
Madam.

343
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,520
Disaster from the peri,

344
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,760
snatch spirit and take the soul.

345
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,080
Spirit snatch.

346
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,600
Soul taking.

347
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,000
Spirit snatch.

348
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Soul taking.

349
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
What is she talking about?

350
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,840
What disaster, what peri?

351
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,080
Loss of soul.

352
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,160
Spirit snatch.

353
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
Soul taking.

354
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,480
Soul taking.

355
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,560
She is the Dancing Peri?

356
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,760
Isn't it an ordinary statue?

357
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,400
Except for the ugly smiling face,

358
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,840
nothing seems special.

359
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,720
Can she really snatch someone's spirit?

360
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,600
No one has seen

361
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,160
it snatch any spirit.

362
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,080
Who are you?

363
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,320
when you have arrived here?

364
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm here all the time.

365
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,600
I should be the one who asks.

366
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,640
Who are you fellows?

367
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,840
Sir,

368
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,680
we are passing by here to get to our relatives in Qinghe.

369
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,240
So we want to take a rest for a night.

370
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,040
Passing by as you are,

371
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
leave soon then.

372
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,320
Sir,

373
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,360
when was the statue set up?

374
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,240
The Dancing Peri

375
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,960
was once a blessed stone born between heaven and earth.

376
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
Somehow

377
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,960
it was gradually shaped into the image of a peri.

378
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,600
It's been served for long.

379
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,320
But twenty years ago,

380
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,240
the Dancing Peri started to cause trouble.

381
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,440
It can snatch someone's spirit.

382
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,440
It was repressed by a grand clan.

383
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,960
But too many people died.

384
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,320
This place is getting bleaker since then.

385
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,880
A grand clan.

386
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,880
Sir,

387
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,840
who is the clan leader?

388
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm old.

389
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,720
I can't remember.

390
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,720
Sir,

391
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,440
is it the Wen clan of Qishan?

392
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,600
I said I can't remember.

393
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,360
You want to stay for the night?

394
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,480
You stay here then.

395
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,040
Maybe you will understand everything then.

396
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,920
Bro Wei,

397
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,760
I don't feel right here.

398
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,320
The Dancing Peri's smile makes me scared.

399
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,080
Do you think she's really able to snatch souls?

400
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,560
Be at ease.

401
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,880
Even if she were Daluo the immortal, I'd...

402
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,760
Night is cold.

403
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,280
Make a bonfire.

404
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,560
Not cold with some fire.

405
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,480
Thank you, madam.

406
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,960
What happened?

407
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,640
I, I just had a nightmare.

408
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
We were... We were...

409
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,710
How can she suddenly come to life?

410
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,280
This is...

411
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,480
This is the soul snatch of the peri.

412
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,360
Lan Zhan!

413
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,400
Lan Zhan.

414
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,000
She may have crushed on you.

415
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,360
Shut up.

416
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,280
Is she sealed?

417
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,320
What now?

418
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,680
What what now? Run!

419
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,640
Stay cautious.

420
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,720
Thank god.

421
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,720
Thanks to your presence Hanguang Jun.

422
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,840
What? What happened out there?

423
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
Many puppets are coming for us.

424
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,160
What are they?

425
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,680
Shouldn't souls be snatched?

426
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,360
Why they are getting more?

427
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,880
There is no spirit snatch at all.

428
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
It's a cover!

429
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
All gods, all immortals.

430
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,400
Please come to save me.

431
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,320
All gods, all immortals.

432
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,080
Lan Zhan!

433
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,360
The Dire Owl!

434
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
The damn bird again.

435
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,240
Did we fall into a trap?
