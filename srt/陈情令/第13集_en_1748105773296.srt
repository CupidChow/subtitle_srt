00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Episode 1

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Lan Zhan.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are your legs okay?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Lan Zhan.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We're in a relationship.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What can't we say?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Your legs are really okay.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't force yourself.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or else...

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll carry you.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're boring.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Lan Zhan, you're...

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Lan Zhan, you're so naughty.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you keep going like this,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
you'll get hurt.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Lan Zhan.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Miss Wen, it's me.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't answer.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Just listen.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I just have a few words to say to you.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you for saving me last night.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I know you have your difficulties.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But I have another request.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please help me.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Can you think of a way to let Lan Zhan rest?

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ying.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's take a break here.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go drink some water.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Lan Zhan.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll go get you some water.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You really think for someone.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're afraid they'll be tired.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're so naughty.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's better that way.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wen Qing.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You shouldn't have thought for yourself.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You should have thought for your brother.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't make me do anything.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait for me.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Get up and continue to the road.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait for me.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll let you go.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's definitely here.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go to the cave where the monster was hiding.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You must find it before dark.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you can't find it, ask your master.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Young Master.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,640
Here.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,080
You manage to rape Koizumi

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,280
and crossing Smells to places

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,560
babe with no standard.

84
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,800
But

85
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,100
that's not all.

86
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
Jumping is an eye-catching weapon.

87
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,560
No wonder she acts like a servant to the溫 clan.

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
With a chance,

89
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,280
I don't pay much attention to her.

90
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,480
Only her spiritual power

91
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,760
does not deserve started.

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,640
What are you doing?

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,940
But Young master Wen asked you came to see the poison LinkedIn?

94
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
I'm not asking you to talk nonsense.

95
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,140
Young Master, we've searched everywhere.

96
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
We didn't find any cave.

97
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,020
What did you say?

98
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,100
It's all my fault.

99
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,380
It's all my fault.

100
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
What are you doing?

101
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,140
Here.

102
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,140
Young Master Wen,

103
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,820
junioror Tian...

104
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

105
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

106
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

107
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

108
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

109
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

110
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

111
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

112
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

113
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

114
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

115
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

116
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

117
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

118
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

119
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key at all

120
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I'm not sure if I could get the key.

121
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

122
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key!

123
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

124
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
I'm not sure if I can get the key.

125
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
I should find it on the right side of the house.

126
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
I don't know if I can get it from my ring.

127
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
I thought there would be a secret exit.

128
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,220
No way you'd haveids there

129
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,600
What?

130
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,740
Sister!

131
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,360
Are you alright?

132
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,220
What are you doing?

133
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
What are you doing?

134
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,220
What's the big deal?

135
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
You've got the monster.

136
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
You can bear the responsibility?

137
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
You brought us here.

138
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
You said you're a monster.

139
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
So, what monster are you?

140
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
You didn't tell us anything.

141
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
You took our spirit ring.

142
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
You made us so helpless.

143
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,220
You told us?

144
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,220
How many times do I have to tell you?

145
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Don't make a mistake.

146
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,220
You...

147
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,220
are just my dogs.

148
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,220
I'm the one who's the number 8.

149
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,220
I don't need anyone to tell me what to do.

150
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Only I, the one who lost the war with the commander,

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,220
can take revenge on the monster.

152
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
What are you looking at?

153
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Keep going.

154
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Yes, it's here.

155
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Go down.

156
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
It's a deep bottom.

157
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
You don't know what monster is inside.

158
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,220
If you don't tell us, how are we going to get down?

159
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Wei Ying.

160
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,220
Be careful.

161
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
You're also being dragged down?

162
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Get out.

163
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm afraid you'll be swallowed by the monster and throw away my family.

164
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,220
They've already figured it out.

165
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Are you worried that my monster will be swallowed?

166
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,220
Instead of seeing the dog's daughter as a blessing,

167
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
we should get down and fight with the monster.

168
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
That's right.

169
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
There's another one down there.

170
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,220
Are you all dead?

171
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Why are you all dead?

172
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,220
It's okay.

173
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
You're dead.

174
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
Hurry up and go back to the painting.

175
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Be careful. I'll make you all die.

176
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Listen.

177
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,220
I'm afraid there's a hundred of them out there.

178
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
There's a monster.

179
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Sir, there's no way.

180
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
No way. Keep searching.

181
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Search carefully.

182
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Yes.

183
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,220
You guys, find someone to put up a trap and bring that thing out.

184
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
Nonsense.

185
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
You're going to be killed with heavy blood.

186
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Aren't we going to die?

187
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
What?

188
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,220
You just want to show us your true colors?

189
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Sir.

190
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
I think it's him.

191
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
It's him.

192
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Maybe it's another one.

193
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
Why?

194
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Do you think he looks good?

195
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
You can't bear to see him.

196
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Nonsense.

197
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
What can I bear to see him?

198
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
I'll take care of it.

199
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Sir.

200
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
You don't understand human language?

201
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Or do you want to save the beauty of the hero?

202
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
Is that enough?

203
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
You're afraid that you're not strong enough to be a hero.

204
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,220
Now you're going to use the alive blood to be a hero.

205
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
I didn't expect that Jin Zixuan is so bold.

206
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
You're going to rebel again?

207
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,220
Sir.

208
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,220
I'm nervous.

209
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

210
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Now, you guys, do it yourself.

211
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,220
Tie this girl up.

212
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,220
Or you'll have to go back to your families.

213
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,220
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
You guys are so brave.

215
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
You're so brave.

216
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
I can't bear to see him.

217
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
No.

218
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
No.

219
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
Kill him.

220
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Kill him.

221
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Sir.

222
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
You're so brave.

223
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Kill them all.

224
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
Kill them all.

225
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
That's right.

226
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,220
The family of seven people is not a traitor.

227
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
You should kill them all.

228
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
What did you say?

229
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Do you want me to say it again?

230
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Then I'll say it again.

231
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,220
The family of seven people is not a traitor.

232
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,220
You should kill them all.

233
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,220
You should kill them all.

234
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,220
You should kill them all.

235
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
You should kill them all.

236
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Do you understand?

237
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
How dare you say such a big nonsense?

238
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
You're so stupid.

239
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
What did you say?

240
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
You're so stupid.

241
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
I think it's your fault.

242
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Wencheng, do you know who said this?

243
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
This is the clear and white

244
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,220
white and white in your family's Wenmen Jinhua Road.

245
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,220
This is the big and famous

246
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
in your family's Wenmen Jinhua Road.

247
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
Wenmeng said

248
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,220
you said your ancestors' name was a big one.

249
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
You're so stupid.

250
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Good.

251
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
Good.

252
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,220
Very good.

253
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
Very good.

254
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Very good.

255
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
By the way,

256
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,220
what is the crime of insulting Wenmen?

257
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
If I remember it correctly,

258
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,220
I remember it was a murder.

259
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
Right?

260
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Right?

261
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Very good.

262
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,220
Then you can die now.

263
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
You're so stupid.

264
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
Don't move.

265
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Miss.

266
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,220
If you move again,

267
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
I'll give you this Weng.

268
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
Stop it.

269
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Wei Wuxian, let him go.

270
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,220
Don't move.

271
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,220
Listen to him.

272
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Wei Wuxian,

273
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
don't move.

274
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Everyone, put down your weapons.

275
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Put down your weapons.

276
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Don't move.

277
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
You know your master's temper.

278
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Your master is in my hands now.

279
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,220
If he's a low blooded man,

280
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
all the people here

281
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
including you

282
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
will die.

283
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Jiang Cheng,

284
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
it's the earthquake.

285
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
No.

286
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
It's not the earthquake.

287
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Something is moving in the city.

288
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
It's the earthquake.

289
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Jun Sheng,

290
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
he's not well.

291
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,220
He won't attack me if he doesn't come out.

292
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
No.

293
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Wei Chongliang, save me.

294
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
No.

295
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
It's fire.

296
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
It's the fire of the night.

297
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
It's the fire of the night.

298
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
Be careful.

299
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Be careful, my master.

300
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,220
Be careful, my master.

301
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
Be careful.

302
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,220
What are you doing?

303
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Help.

304
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
My father.

305
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
Hurry up.

306
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,220
Uncle.

307
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Does it hurt?

308
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
Uncle.

309
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
Does it hurt?

310
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Does it hurt?

311
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Uncle.

312
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
Does it hurt?

313
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Hurry up.

314
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Don't move.

315
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
Hurry up.

316
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
Uncle is here.

317
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Let's go.

318
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Wait.

319
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
Go.

320
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Don't move.

321
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Stop.

322
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
Stop.

323
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
Get out of here.

324
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,220
Move.

325
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
You bastard.

326
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
They cut off the sound.

327
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
It's Wen family's doing.

328
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Who else?

329
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
We didn't see them.

330
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
What should we do now?

331
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
Stop.

332
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,220
Don't.

333
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Stop.

334
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Stop.

335
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Stop.

336
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
You're useless to me.

337
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Stop.

338
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
They'll die.

339
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
What if they die?

340
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Wen Chao.

341
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
You did this.

342
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
How could Uncle Wen want to explain to the world?

343
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Stop taking my father's medicine.

344
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
They're nothing.

345
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,220
They're going to be cleaned up by our Wen family.

346
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
We just need to find a reason to go back.

347
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
They said when they were hunting,

348
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
they had an accident.

349
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
Who could take my father's medicine?

350
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Let's go.

351
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
Wait for two more days to help them.

352
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
They fled and died.

353
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,780
If you loveHaibao,

354
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,220
come with us.

355
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Don't bother.

356
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,220
My dad and mom would come.

357
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
They heard that.

358
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
They'll come from here.

359
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,240
They think when we're going around amend

360
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,740
they're going to find the place.

361
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
After Wen's family has gone,

362
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
they won't tell us the truth.

363
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
We need to go back to that cave.

364
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,220
I can't stay in this cave without food

365
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
but with a beast.

366
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Jiang Cheng.

367
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
Jiang Cheng.

368
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Jiang Cheng, you want to eat meat?

369
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
I'm cooking meat.

370
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
You want to eat it?

371
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
Get out of here.

372
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
I'll burn you to death.

373
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,220
When will you know?

374
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
I really want to make you mad.

375
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
I'm sorry.

377
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
Don't cry.

378
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,220
Don't cry.

379
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
I'm not the one who was burned.

380
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
I'm not you.

381
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
I'm really hurt.

382
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Please help me.

383
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Jiang Cheng, don't cry.

384
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
I'm not the one who's crying.

385
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Don't cry.

386
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
Young Master Lan.

387
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Young Master Lan.

388
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Where are you going?

389
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,220
The beast is still in the black circle.

390
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,220
I can leave the circle.

391
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
What can I do?

392
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
There's a wind.

393
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,220
By the way,

394
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
there's a wind in the circle.

395
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
There's no wind in the cave.

396
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
This means

397
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
there's a water-related communication

398
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
between the black circle and the exit.

399
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
That's why we hid the wind from that place.

400
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
But how do we know

401
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
if the hole is big enough

402
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
and can be locked in?

403
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
What if it's small?

404
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
What if it's just a hole?

405
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
And that beast

406
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
still stays in the cave and doesn't want to go out.

407
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
I said

408
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,220
you can move it.

409
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
You're smarter than sitting here

410
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
and waiting for your father and mother to come.

411
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,220
How is he going to keep it?

412
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Just take it out.

413
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Just take it out.

414
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
No!

415
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
There's a hole in the ground.

416
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
It's not small.

417
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,220
It's not small.

418
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
How small is it?

419
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
You can move it once.

420
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,220
Listen up.

421
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Follow the river and get out of the cave.

422
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
If you're hurt,

423
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
you'll be hurt.

424
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
If you're in trouble,

425
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,220
you'll be in trouble.

426
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
If you're in trouble,

427
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
you'll be in trouble.

428
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,220
You can move it once.

429
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
No one wants to grab it.

430
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
Now,

431
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
get out of the cave.

432
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
Hurry up.

433
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Hurry up.

434
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
Come here.

435
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Come here right now.

436
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
Come here.

437
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,220
Come here.

438
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,720
Hurry and go!

439
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
There are marine otters!

440
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,220
Hurry and go!

441
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Hurry.

442
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,220
Get them back!

443
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Teresa,

444
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
this nature is Cindrish,

445
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,720
she's coming to rescue us!

446
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Wait a minute, I'll come back!

447
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,220
Run!

448
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,220
The End

449
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,220
Lan Zhan, it's okay.

450
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,220
That monster seems to be sealed by something.

451
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Wait a minute.

452
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
Do you have a rope?

453
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,220
I'm tired.

454
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
You have a good sense of humor.

455
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
You...

456
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,220
What do you mean by me?

457
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,220
Don't be so cocky when you're in this kind of critical moment.

458
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Can you hold your leg?

459
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,220
You're so mean.

460
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Hold it.

461
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Hold it.

462
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,220
Wait a minute.

463
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
I forgot to bring you the good stuff.

464
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Why is it only a little?

465
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,220
This is the medicine that Wen Ning gave me.

466
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,220
I can't believe it.

467
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,220
I left it for you.

468
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,220
Forget it.

469
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
There's no medicine for it.

470
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Lan Zhan.

471
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,220
I have to find a way to get Lan Zhan's blood out.

472
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Come on.

473
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Take it off.

474
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
What?

475
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
What else can I do?

476
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Take off your clothes.

477
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
You've been in the field for so long.

478
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
You're wearing a big dress.

479
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,220
Aren't you uncomfortable?

480
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
Take it off.

481
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I'll get you some.

482
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Take it off.

483
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,220
You don't want to take it off?

484
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,220
I'll help you.

485
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Wen Ning.

486
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
What are you doing?

487
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
What are you doing?

488
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Take off your clothes.

489
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,220
You don't want to take it off?

490
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Fine.

491
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,220
I'll take it off.

492
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,220
Fine.

493
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,220
The blood is coming out.

494
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Are you feeling better now?

495
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
Thank you.

496
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
Forget it.

497
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm afraid that others will thank me.

498
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Especially you.

499
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
A real thank you.

500
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
You're so kind.

501
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Doctor Ren.

502
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,220
What's wrong?

503
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Does it hurt?

504
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Doctor Ren, is it okay?

505
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,220
It hurts Lan Zhan.

506
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Wen Ning, go.

507
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,220
Lan Zhan.

508
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
You're going to look at me now.

509
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Actually, I used to get hurt.

510
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
I often get water in my nose

511
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
after getting hurt.

512
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Besides,

513
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
there's not much of your blood.

514
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
I think you need it.

515
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
It's painful.

516
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Don't be busy next time.

517
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
You think I'm thinking,

518
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
I can't help it?

519
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
Who knows

520
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
that woman in the royal mausoleum

521
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
is so cruel?

522
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,220
You know,

523
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,220
a girl

524
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
is pretty.

525
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,220
If she left a mark

526
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
on her face,

527
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
it would be so bad

528
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,220
to keep it on her face for the rest of her life.

529
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
You can't take it off

530
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
for the rest of your life.

531
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
You can't take it off

532
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
for the rest of your life.

533
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,220
That's different.

534
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,220
It's not on your face anyway.

535
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
And I'm a man.

536
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,220
Every man

537
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,220
can't get hurt for the rest of his life.

538
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,220
There are a few scars.

539
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,220
Besides,

540
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,220
even if this thing

541
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
can't be taken off for the rest of his life,

542
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
it also means

543
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
I've protected a girl.

544
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,220
And this girl

545
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,220
can't help me for the rest of my life.

546
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
It's actually pretty good

547
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,220
to think about it like this.

548
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Right?

549
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,220
You know

550
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,220
she can't forget you for the rest of her life.

551
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Why are you so angry?

552
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
If you mean that,

553
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
don't talk to anyone.

554
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,220
I'm not talking to you.

555
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,220
Unless...

556
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Unless what?

557
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Unless you like me

558
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,220
when you're in a fight.

559
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,220
You like me?

560
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Why should I

561
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
talk to you like this?

562
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
There's no way.

563
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
This place is

564
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
just for you and me.

565
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,220
If you don't talk to me,

566
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
who are you talking to?

567
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,220
But

568
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,220
I'm not talking to you.

569
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
I'm talking to you.

570
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,220
I'm talking to you.

571
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,220
I'm talking to you.

572
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
I'm talking to you.

573
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
I'm talking to you.

574
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
I'm talking to you.

575
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
But

576
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
this is the most

577
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
you've ever said to me.

578
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
You said we were born and raised

579
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,220
so many times.

580
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,220
You didn't even tell me.

581
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Are you guys from the Lan family?

582
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,220
Lan Zhan

583
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,220
are you hungry?

584
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
Have you ever been hungry?

585
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,220
If you don't eat or drink like us,

586
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,220
I think you'll be full for three or four days.

587
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,220
If no one comes to save us,

588
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
I think

589
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,220
our physical strength,

590
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,220
experience and spiritual power

591
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
will be weakened.

592
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
From the palace to Mu Xishan,

593
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,220
it's closer to the dream than to the dream.

594
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
So

595
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,220
it should be your family who comes first.

596
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
Wait slowly.

597
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
But don't worry.

598
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,220
Even if your family doesn't come,

599
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,220
in a few days,

600
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Jiang Cheng will return to the dream.

601
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Jiang Cheng is in a hurry.

602
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,220
The people of the Wen family can't stop him.

603
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,220
They can't wait.

604
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
The people of the Wen family

605
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
are already burned.

606
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
Are they all still there?

607
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
Your uncle

608
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
and your brother

609
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
were injured.

610
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Xiu Cheng

611
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
was missing.

612
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
What?

613
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Zou Wujun was missing?

614
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,220
What's wrong?

615
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,220
My clothes are all burnt.

616
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
How about I cover them for you?

617
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
You go to bed first.

618
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Then we'll be...

619
00:41:42,220 --> 00:42:11,160
I want to

620
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
We were trapped here.

621
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
We offended Wen Chao.

622
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I don't know how Jiang Cheng and them are.

623
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,160
I don't know how Yun Ma is.

624
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,160
The snow is falling.

625
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,160
The mountains are high.

626
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
The clouds are warm.

627
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
The mountains are clear.

628
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
The flowers are like frost.

629
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
The water is like a lake.

630
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
The water is like a lake.

631
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
The water is like a lake.

632
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
The water is like a lake.

633
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,160
The water is like a lake.

634
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
The water is like a lake.

635
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,160
The river is like a lake.

636
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
The water is like a lake.

637
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,160
The big, small mountains like the river are also existemе.

638
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,160
The light isIG Symmetry is bad.

639
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Tens of years passed.

640
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,160
Everyone's fate has till.

641
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,160
The world is kinds of alike.

642
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,160
The big rivers and rivers are like too little.

643
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:44,740
That
