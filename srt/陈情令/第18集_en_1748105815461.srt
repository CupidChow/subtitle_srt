1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one to be released.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one to be released.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one to be released.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one to be released.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
meist

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:21,520
One time

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
I'm done.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
What about you?

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Sister.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
I only have five percent of confidence.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Five percent is fine.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Half and half.

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm so happy.

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
You saved my life.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Thank you.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm so happy.

41
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
No rabbit.

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
I can do it with a chicken.

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm so happy.

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Song An.

45
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Song An's eyes.

46
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
How did he get here?

47
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Master.

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Let me do it.

49
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Go back and rest.

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
It's okay.

51
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Is he awake?

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Yes.

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Miss Wen is checking him for the top.

54
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
He's fine, right?

55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
He's fine.

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
But...

57
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
He's fine.

58
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
He can recover in a few days.

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Brother Song, drink some medicine first.

60
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
I'll go get it.

61
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Childe Wei,

62
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
I didn't expect to meet you here.

63
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I was wondering why you came here.

64
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Who did you get hurt?

65
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
After you separated from Childe Wei,

66
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
I was working on the game with Xing Chen.

67
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
A month ago,

68
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I was holding my master's hand.

69
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
I rushed back to Bai Xue Pavilion to stop him.

70
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I didn't expect that

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
after I returned to Bai Xue Pavilion,

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Master!

73
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Master!

74
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Master!

75
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Master!

76
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Master!

77
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Master!

78
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Master!

79
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Master!

80
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Be careful!

81
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Who are you?

82
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Xue Yang.

83
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Master!

84
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Song Wan,

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
tell Xing Chen

86
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
this is the gift I gave him.

87
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
He took my Bai Xue Pavilion,

88
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
and promised me that I'd stay here for a day.

89
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
He kept hiding there, waiting for my master's blessing.

90
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
He took my hand.

91
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
This Xue Yang

92
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
is to revenge on Xing Chen.

93
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
And then?

94
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Then I asked Chen Chen.

95
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
By the way,

96
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I saw Xing Chen in the room.

97
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
He told me

98
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
he wanted to take me to see his master,

99
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Baoshan Sanren.

100
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
He could heal my eyes.

101
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Baoshan Sanren?

102
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
It's a legend.

103
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
He can live or die.

104
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
If he's a ghost, he'll die.

105
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Exactly.

106
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
He brought me to Yiling.

107
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
After that,

108
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
I didn't know anything.

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Then I met Mr. Wei.

110
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Where's Baoshan Sanren?

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Is he here?

112
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Let him rest.

113
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
But...

114
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Baoshan Sanren is my master.

115
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I don't know where he is.

116
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
You mean, Baoshan?

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Yes.

118
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Senior sister.

119
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Jiang Cheng is saved.

120
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
You're awake.

121
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Come and eat.

122
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Jiang Cheng.

123
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Do you really want to die?

124
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I can't help it.

125
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I can't help it.

126
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Jiang Cheng.

127
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Do you really want to die?

128
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
I can't do anything.

129
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I'd rather die than be a ghost.

130
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
I could just die.

131
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I'd rather die.

132
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Maybe I can become a ghost.

133
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
You've been a ghost since you were a kid.

134
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Even if you die,

135
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
you can't become a ghost.

136
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Since you can't even hold on to death,

137
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
what's the difference

138
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
between being dead and alive?

139
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
But if you don't replenish your physical strength,

140
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
how can you get your gold medal back?

141
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Yes.

142
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
You don't have to suspect me.

143
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
You didn't hear it wrong.

144
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
What I said is,

145
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
get your gold medal back.

146
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
You have a way.

147
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I have a way.

148
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
You knew it long ago.

149
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,520
My mother's funeral is Baoshan Sanren's painting.

150
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Who is Baoshan Sanren?

151
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,520
It's said that he lived for hundreds of years.

152
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
He can live a dead person,

153
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
but he's a white-haired, out-of-the-world man.

154
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
You mean...

155
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
You mean...

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I mean, I have a way.

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
I also know

158
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,520
which mountain Baoshan is.

159
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
In other words,

160
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
I can take you to see Baoshan Sanren.

161
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
But...

162
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
But don't you remember the novel?

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
But I don't remember everything.

164
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I have repeated many times.

165
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I still remember it.

166
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
I always remember

167
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
a woman's voice

168
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
repeating to me.

169
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
She told me something

170
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
and a place.

171
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
She always told me

172
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
if I encounter something

173
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
that I can't help but remember,

174
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
I can go to that place,

175
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
find that mountain,

176
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
and ask for the immortal on the mountain.

177
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Sit down.

178
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
What are you doing?

179
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
What are you doing?

180
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Eat.

181
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
But...

182
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Don't talk while eating.

183
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Or you won't talk.

184
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
This is for you.

185
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Eat first.

186
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
I'll take you to see him

187
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
in a few days.

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Jin Tian.

189
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Tomorrow,

190
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
we'll have a talk with Shijie.

191
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
She won't be with us.

192
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
What are you afraid of?

193
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
The immortal has been gone for hundreds of years.

194
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
You don't want to say it?

195
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Besides, there are many opportunities.

196
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
I have to tell you slowly.

197
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
If you go to the mountain,

198
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
or you get in the way,

199
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
and you get angry with the master,

200
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
you and I have to finish it.

201
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Remember,

202
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
after you go to the mountain,

203
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
you must not open your eyes,

204
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
look around,

205
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
look at the scenery on the mountain,

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
or look at someone else's face.

207
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
And remember,

208
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
no matter what the other person wants you to do,

209
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
you must take care of it.

210
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
And the most important thing,

211
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
if the other person asks you who you are,

212
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
you must say,

213
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
you are the son of the immortal.

214
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
You must not expose yourself.

215
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Do you understand?

216
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Besides these,

217
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,520
you can tell the truth about other things.

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Including your injury.

219
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Who hurt you.

220
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Okay.

221
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
This matter,

222
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
except you know it,

223
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
you must not let the third person know.

224
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Including Shijie,

225
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
or else she will definitely follow us.

226
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Okay.

227
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Whether I say anything now,

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
you will say it well.

229
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Eat.

230
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Hurry up.

231
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
By the way,

232
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
where is my sister?

233
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Shijie is fine.

234
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I guess she is in the back mountain now.

235
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
She will ask you to pick the medicine together.

236
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
If she doesn't do anything,

237
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
she won't eat it.

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
It's really hard to eat.

239
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
In terms of the heaven poison,

240
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
she is really not familiar with Jiangcheng.

241
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Actually, I came here

242
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
just to tell you that

243
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Song brother's eyes recover very quickly.

244
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
He can recover very quickly.

245
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Then he can leave very quickly.

246
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I have given you a chance.

247
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
You have kept so many people who want to catch you.

248
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
There is no need to give me another one.

249
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
That's right.

250
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
By the way,

251
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I have asked Song brother to take Shijie

252
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
to the capital and Lan Zhan to meet them.

253
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Wenqing,

254
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
give me your body powder.

255
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I want that kind of

256
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
that can make people sleep all day.

257
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Thank you.

258
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Have you thought about it?

259
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
What should we do?

260
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
No,

261
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
she will never know.

262
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
No,

263
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
she will never know.

264
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
No,

265
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
she will never know.

266
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
No,

267
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
she will never know.

268
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
She will never know.

269
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
No,

270
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
she will never know

271
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
when you hide it from her.

272
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Wenqing,

273
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
if something happens today,

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
I believe you will make the same choice

275
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
as me.

276
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Wenqing,

277
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Shijie.

278
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
A'Xin.

279
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Shijie,

280
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I...

281
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Shijie, I...

282
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
A'Cheng just fell asleep.

283
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Don't disturb him.

284
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
He has already slept enough.

285
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
A'Xin.

286
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
You mean it.

287
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
I think it's okay.

288
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Let's talk over there.

289
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Let's go.

290
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Shijie,

291
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
I don't think you slept well these days.

292
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I especially asked Wenqing

293
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
for some sweet rice noodles.

294
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
God bless you.

295
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
You can put it in the box.

296
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
A'Xin,

297
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I haven't seen you since this afternoon.

298
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Where have you been?

299
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Have you eaten?

300
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Wait,

301
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Shijie,

302
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
this taste...

303
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
It's really lotus root soup.

304
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
It's lotus root soup.

305
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
I especially made you a bowl of it.

306
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
But

307
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
it's not as good as Yunmeng.

308
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It tastes a bit different.

309
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Try it.

310
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Try it.

311
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
It smells so good.

312
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Shijie,

313
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
do you remember

314
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
when you first made lotus root soup for me?

315
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I remember.

316
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
At that time,

317
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I just took you to Jiangjia.

318
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes.

319
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
At that time,

320
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
when I first made lotus root soup,

321
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
I was so tired.

322
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Especially in Jiangcheng,

323
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
there were dogs.

324
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Shijie,

325
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Jiangcheng has always been

326
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
the magical figure.

327
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Why are you here?

328
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Why?

329
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Why?

330
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Why?

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Why?

332
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Why are you doing this to my dogs?

333
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Why?

334
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Why?

335
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Why?

336
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Why?

337
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Why?

338
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Shijie,

339
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
don't be afraid.

340
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Cheng is a good boy.

341
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
He'll be fine in a few days.

342
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Sorry, uncle Qiqing.

343
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
I'm in trouble.

344
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Shijie,

345
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
in the lotus root soup,

346
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
you don't need to apologize

347
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
for what you did wrong.

348
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Remember.

349
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Shijie, Shijie.

350
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Let me in.

351
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I want to sleep.

352
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Who is your Shijie?

353
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Give me back my Feifei.

354
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Give me back my Mo Li.

355
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Give me back my Xiao Han.

356
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Why?

357
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Are you afraid?

358
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
That's my dog.

359
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
My house.

360
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
It's all mine.

361
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Why are you here?

362
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Stay here.

363
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I'll go.

364
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll go.

365
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
I'll go.

366
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I'll go.

367
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I'll go.

368
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
I'll go.

369
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I'll go.

370
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Go away.

371
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Let me see you again.

372
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I'll let a dog bite you.

373
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
I'll go.

374
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I'll go.

375
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Don't take me here.

376
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Go away.

377
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
A-Xie.

378
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Wei Wuxian.

379
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
A-Xie.

380
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
What are you doing on the tree?

381
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
A-Xie, I saw you.

382
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Your shoes are all under the tree.

383
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
My shoes.

384
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I saw you.

385
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
You're not wearing shoes.

386
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I saw you.

387
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I saw you.

388
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I saw you.

389
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I saw you.

390
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I saw you.

391
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I saw you.

392
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
I saw you.

393
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
I saw you.

394
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I saw you.

395
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
My shoes.

396
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Come down.

397
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Let's go home.

398
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
No.

399
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I won't go down.

400
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
There's a dog.

401
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
There's no dog.

402
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
A-Cheng lied to you.

403
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
How long have you been talking?

404
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
If you go down like this,

405
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
your hands will be sore.

406
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Come down.

407
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Hurry up and go.

408
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Or you won't go down.

409
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
A-Xie.

410
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
A-Xie.

411
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
A-Cheng.

412
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
A-Cheng.

413
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
A-Cheng.

414
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
My legs are broken.

415
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
No, Duan.

416
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
There should be no snake.

417
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
A-Cheng.

418
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
You stay here. Don't move.

419
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I'll carry you back.

420
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Dog.

421
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Dog is here.

422
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
No.

423
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
No.

424
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
I'll drive you away if there's a dog.

425
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
A-Cheng.

426
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
A-Cheng.

427
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Come.

428
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Are your shoes not for foot?

429
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
No, they are for foot.

430
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Try them on.

431
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
This is the first time

432
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
my uncle gave me these.

433
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
It's okay.

434
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I'll go back and change them for you.

435
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
No need to bother.

436
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
A-Xie.

437
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
No matter what A-Cheng told you,

438
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
don't argue with him.

439
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
He has a bad temper.

440
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
He always plays at home.

441
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
That little puppy

442
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
really likes it.

443
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Now he's been sent away by dad.

444
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
He's really sad.

445
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
He doesn't say it in his mouth.

446
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Actually, he's happy

447
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
that he has more people to accompany him.

448
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
He's worried that you might

449
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
have something wrong

450
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
if you don't go back in the day.

451
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
He's anxious to wake me up.

452
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I came out to find him.

453
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Do you know that?

454
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I don't know.

455
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Shan Shan.

456
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
A-Cheng.

457
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
A-Cheng.

458
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Don't cry.

459
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Didn't I tell you to call someone

460
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
to come out to find him?

461
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Don't cry.

462
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Do you have something to say to A-Xian?

463
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
It's okay.

465
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
A-Cheng.

466
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Take A-Xian's quilt back, okay?

467
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I'll go back.

468
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Okay.

469
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Come.

470
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Be careful.

471
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
You two.

472
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
What should I do?

473
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm sorry.

475
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Don't worry.

476
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I won't

477
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
hit you in front of Uncle.

478
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I was

479
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
hurt by

480
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
going out to dig.

481
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Don't worry.

482
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I'll see the dog

483
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
and drive him away.

484
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I'm sorry.

486
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Xiaotian.

487
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Is this right?

488
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
This is the soup I made tonight.

489
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
It's still hot.

490
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Drink it while it's hot.

491
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
The ribs I made

492
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
are the best.

493
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Come on.

494
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Come on.

495
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Drink it.

496
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Yours.

497
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Drink it.

498
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Cheers.

499
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
I still remember

500
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
the soup I made

501
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
that night.

502
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
A-Xian.

503
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
You.

504
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
I.

505
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
A-Cheng.

506
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
We three

507
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
have been together

508
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
for a long time.

509
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
We will never part.

510
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
We will never part.

511
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Senior.

512
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Senior.

513
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Senior.

514
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
This fragrant powder

515
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
has enough to

516
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
make Brother Song

517
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
leave Yiling.

518
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
I'll take him

519
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
to Yiling.

520
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Sister.

521
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
When I get the gold medal,

522
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
I'll go to Lianling to pick you up.

523
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Brother Song.

524
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
When I wake up,

525
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
no matter what,

526
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
I must send him to Lianling.

527
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
I must not let him come back.

528
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I understand.

529
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
When the world wakes up,

530
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I will blame myself

531
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
for my own actions.

532
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm afraid this time,

533
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
his anger will not be so easy to laugh at.

534
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
When will he really

535
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
be angry at you?

536
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
It's true.

537
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
Master Wei, Master Jiang.

538
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
What are you doing?

539
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Brother Song.

540
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I'll entrust

541
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
my sister's safety to you.

542
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Don't worry.

543
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I'll take care of it.

544
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
As long as I'm here,

545
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
I'll let Miss Jiang

546
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
safely go to Lianling to pick you up.

547
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
By the way, Master Wei.

548
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
If you see Xing Chen,

549
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
can you tell him a few words?

550
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Just say...

551
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Forget it.

552
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
I'll take my leave.

553
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Miss Wen, Master Wen.

554
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Goodbye.

555
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Let's go.

556
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
We're leaving, too.

557
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Miss Wen.

558
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Thank you for taking care of me.

559
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Goodbye.

560
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
Wen Qing,

561
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
don't blame yourself.

562
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
After all, Lianhua House...

563
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
You don't have to explain it to him.

564
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
If it were me,

565
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I'm afraid the attitude would be worse than him.

566
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Wen Qing,

567
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
don't blame yourself.

568
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
After all, Lianhua House...

569
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
You don't have to explain it to him.

570
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
If it were me,

571
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm afraid the attitude would be worse than him.

572
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Have you really thought it through?

573
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
I've never hesitated.

574
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Sister.

575
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
I don't like

576
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
the two of us.

577
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:50,520
Genkokville,

578
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,520
The havathin and their crown

579
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,120
is the last resort

580
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
of the Qin peeled rice for high knock,

581
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,000
... buscando up the aquifer of voices.

582
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,180
And killing three BTSs

583
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,260
was the path for the victory.

584
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
This is it.

585
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Is this really the place where the mountain is scattered?

586
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Absolutely.

587
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Why would I lie to you?

588
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Let you be happy for a few days and then fight harder?

589
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Alright, we'll have to take the road here by yourself.

590
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
I'll be right back.

591
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Alright, I'll wait for you at the little town below the mountain.

592
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Got it.

593
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
The mountain is a little far away.

594
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Jiang Cheng, there's only one chance.

595
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Don't be so impulsive next time.

596
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
I'll be right back.

597
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Jiang Cheng, remember,

598
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,520
don't open your eyes.

599
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
There's no beast on this mountain.

600
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,520
If you walk slower, even if you fall, you can't pull it down.

601
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Don't be so curious.

602
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Just bite to death and say you're Wei Wuxian.

603
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
You know what to answer, right?

604
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Dad.

605
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Master, please wait.

606
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Master, please wait.

607
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Please wait.

608
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Master, please wait.

609
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Please...

610
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Is this the place where the mountain is scattered?

611
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,520
Who are you? What's the matter?

612
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I'm the disciple of the mountain.

613
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm the son of the mountain.

614
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Wei Ying came to see you.

615
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
The mountain is scattered?

616
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
He's already gone out.

617
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
He has no name on the mountain.

618
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,520
Please go back.

619
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Wei Ying came to see you.

620
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
I hope the master can remember your love.

621
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
I'll spare your life.

622
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
I'll spare your life?

623
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Why are you saying that?

624
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,520
When my father and mother passed away,

625
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Wei Ying was raised by the family of the Yume family.

626
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
She became the disciple of the Yume family.

627
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Today, the mountain is in chaos.

628
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
The ancestors of the family are all dead.

629
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,520
The Yume family is not dead.

630
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,520
The Yume family is in chaos.

631
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Master Jiang and Mrs. Yun are killed.

632
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,520
And I'm also in this mess

633
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,520
being killed by the Wendu and the Wendu.

634
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm a useless person.

635
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,520
You said you're the son of the mountain.

636
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Who is your father?

637
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
The family of the master Jiang.

638
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Wei Changze.

639
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Where did your parents go?

640
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
A night hunting more than ten years ago.

641
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
The master told you that

642
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
he was the mountain.

643
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Yes.

644
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Yes.

645
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I'm here to tell you that

646
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
the mountain is in chaos.

647
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Yes.

648
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Forget it.

649
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Everything is fate.

650
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Get up.

651
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Yes.

652
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Pull the bandage.

653
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Follow me.

654
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Thank you, master.

655
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
You're welcome.

656
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
You don't have to say anything.

657
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
I have nothing to say.

658
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Yes.
