1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Black cat

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but it wasn't a black cat.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It was a black cat.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was black cat.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was a black cat.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It was a black cat.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,820
The Empress Tower

14
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,740
Episode 50

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,380
You thought of it, but don't know how toSchhole,

16
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,380
it really is the Roots of plenty.

17
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,020
Now,

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,460
who can semiconductor me好吧?

19
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Lan Zheng.

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,720
Don't you remember our promise?

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,420
You allowed me to meet the Fu Ruo in my life.

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,260
I guess I won't have to leave.

23
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,940
but you still can live nothing but strength for perfect protection.

24
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,500
It's a gift from heaven that will keep you safe,

25
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,840
without any other resistant to hurt,

26
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,620
but only because it will protect you.

27
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,860
You were the one who framed23 sins,

28
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,320
how about empower others?

29
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,620
In this trip,

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
every last vehicle from Void will attract

31
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,640
Are these the words that���

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,580
This hatred of mine Naughty

33
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,860
Is not to be laden with rebirth

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,980
You've been born a hero

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,580
Otherwise, Heaven and earth would崩�iss

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
I have already missed the chance to save Qiu Ran.

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
This time, no matter what, I will not let go.

38
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Ke Hao.

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
You must save him.

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I will not let you go.

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Lan Zhan.

42
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
If there is a fight between us,

43
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I would rather die with you.

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
If you want to die,

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
at least,

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
you will die in the hands of your Han Guang Jun.

47
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I won't.

48
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I will not let you go.

49
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
I will not let you go.

50
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
I will not let you go.

51
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
I will not let you go.

52
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
I will not let you go.

53
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I will not let you go.

54
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Where is this?

55
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
It's alright.

57
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Can...can we live here?

58
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Why not?

59
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
I've been living here for three months.

60
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
He's my old friend.

61
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Follow him.

62
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Follow him.

63
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,360
The End

64
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,360
The old senior from Lan's who hasn't been living here for years has come.

65
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I knew it would be like this sooner or later.

66
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Let's see how it goes.

67
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Guangyao.

68
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,360
You can talk to the sect leaders.

69
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Do what Wei Wuxian did.

70
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,360
This time, Wei Wuxian made Wen Ning a puppet.

71
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
He opened a murder ring.

72
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Four people were killed.

73
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,360
The Wenshi Yu Party and Wushi.

74
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Wei Wuxian took them to the Lanzang Hall.

75
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
They occupied the Fumo Hall of Xue Chonghai.

76
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,360
They set up a new square on the hill.

77
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,360
But none of us has made it up.

78
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
It's too hard.

79
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
This is really unbearable.

80
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,360
I'll take him to Lanling Palace to apologize.

81
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,360
If there's any way to save him, please let me know.

82
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I'll try my best to solve it.

83
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Master, I didn't say anything in your face.

84
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,360
But these poison palaces are not only from our Jin family.

85
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
They're also from other families.

86
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Right?

87
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Yes.

88
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
The ones Wei Ying killed are also from my family.

89
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
That's right.

90
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,360
The chief of Jin's family is not pursuing us.

91
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
But we can't do it.

92
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
You all don't know.

93
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
The Wenshi Yu Party that Wei Wuxian is going to save.

94
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
His name is Wen Ning.

95
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,360
He and his sister Wen Qing were both blessed by me in the war.

96
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,360
So what's the blessing?

97
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Qi Shan and Wenshi are not the murderers of the Jiang family.

98
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Wen Qing and Wen Ning are my brothers.

99
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
I've been to Lan's school.

100
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Their relationship is different from Wenshi's.

101
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
I've never seen them before.

102
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,360
But they've never participated in the war.

103
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
They didn't participate in it.

104
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
They didn't stop it.

105
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,360
They look like the red people around Wen Ruohan.

106
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Wen Qing is Wen Ruohan's relative.

107
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,360
I think he can't stop it.

108
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
When Wenshi is evil,

109
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
he's just not against it.

110
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Then he's equal to the one who's good at it.

111
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Wenshi can't be a good man when she's a man.

112
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
But she's not willing to bear the burden of suffering.

113
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
She's just a burden.

114
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
What you said is right.

115
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Wen Qing is Wen Ruohan's relative.

116
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,360
She said she didn't participate in the war.

117
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
No matter whether others believe it or not,

118
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
I don't believe it.

119
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Who's the one who didn't kill Wen Qing?

120
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Maybe we didn't find it.

121
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Yes.

122
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,360
These dogs can't be released.

123
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Wenshi is the enemy to us.

124
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Yes.

125
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Chief Jiang Cheng,

126
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
I shouldn't interfere in your family affairs.

127
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,360
But I have to remind you about Wei Ying.

128
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Please.

129
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Wei Ying is your right-hand man.

130
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
You care about her.

131
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
We all know that.

132
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
But if she respects you,

133
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,360
it's hard to say.

134
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
I haven't seen any subordinate of mine

135
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
who's been a family member for so many years.

136
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,360
I'm so proud of her.

137
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Do you know what she said?

138
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
In the war of the sun,

139
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
all the soldiers of your family

140
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
were supported by Wei Wuxian.

141
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Isn't that a nonsense?

142
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Yes.

143
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Chief Jin asked Wei Ying to hand over the Eagle Tiger's Talisman.

144
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
It was a good idea.

145
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to marry

146
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
and would be a big deal.

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,360
But he did take the man's father

148
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
and thought that others would be his treasures.

149
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
That's ridiculous.

150
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Who has the most treasure in the family?

151
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Besides, his Eagle Tiger Talisman

152
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
is still unknown.

153
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
There were four pieces of silver iron

154
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
at that time.

155
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
It turns out that

156
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
there was a piece of silver iron

157
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
that was not in the way until now.

158
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
The silver iron that Yue Yang tried

159
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
was stolen by Yue Yang.

160
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
We were all there at that time.

161
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
From Yue Yang to Qing He,

162
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
who knows if Wei Ying

163
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
and Xue Yang were involved in the accident?

164
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
You don't know who

165
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
turned that Wen Shi into a puppet.

166
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Wen Shi.

167
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Wei Wuxian has no doubt about me.

168
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
But he is a member of the Jiang family

169
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
and is a member of the Jiang family.

170
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
He doesn't listen to the teachings of the Sect Leader.

171
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
That day,

172
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
at the big flower banquet,

173
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
he said that he would turn his face

174
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
and leave.

175
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
But behind you,

176
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
he said that

177
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
he had never put the Sect Leader

178
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
in his eyes.

179
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Did you hear that?

180
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Yes.

181
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
No.

182
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
What did you say?

183
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I didn't hear Wei Ying say that.

184
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I didn't hear her say

185
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
that she was not interested in the Jiang family.

186
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Really?

187
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
That day, the Mount Baifeng was in a coma.

188
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Mr. Wei was so angry and said too much.

189
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
He said so much.

190
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Maybe he said something similar.

191
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I can't remember.

192
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
That's right.

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
He was so arrogant

194
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
and was so arrogant.

195
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Who doesn't know

196
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,360
that Mr. Lan Er and Wei Ying

197
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
were always close friends?

198
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I heard that on the day of the Qiong Qi Road,

199
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,360
if Mr. Lan Er deliberately admitted it,

200
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Wei Ying couldn't have run away.

201
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
I've long wanted to say that

202
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Wei Wuxian is a bit of a merit

203
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
in the battle of the days.

204
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,360
But he has more guests than he has.

205
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
No one can be as good as him.

206
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I've always thought that he has a problem.

207
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
He doesn't repair the immortal's tree

208
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
and he doesn't repair the ghost's knife.

209
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
He will be in trouble

210
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
sooner or later.

211
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Look.

212
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,360
The killer has been exposed.

213
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
So many people killed us

214
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
to get rid of the dogs.

215
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's not a killer.

216
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
What do you mean?

217
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
No, I didn't mean anything else.

218
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I just think that

219
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,360
the word Lansha is not very appropriate.

220
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Why not?

221
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Wei Wuxian has been in trouble

222
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,360
since the day of the Qiong Qi Road.

223
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Can you deny it?

224
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
The battle of the days is a battlefield.

225
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,360
The battlefield is not Lansha.

226
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Now it's the old times.

227
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
If those two capitalists

228
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
killed Wen Ning in the era of Fu Lu,

229
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
then it's not Lansha.

230
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
It's not Lansha.

231
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Are you saying that they killed our people?

232
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Are we still in the same situation?

233
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes.

234
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Those capitalists didn't do these things.

235
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,360
And no one saw them.

236
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Yes.

237
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Those living capitalists

238
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,360
said they didn't have the power to replace Fu Lu.

239
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Wen Ning fell down from the cliff

240
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
by accident.

241
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,360
They were careful to cure Wen Ning.

242
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,360
I didn't expect that they would be so violent.

243
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,360
I'm so worried.

244
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Those capitalists were afraid

245
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
that they would be punished

246
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
for forcing them to replace Fu Lu and kill them.

247
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
They fell down by themselves.

248
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Miss Luo,

249
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
I think you are a new emperor.

250
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
You are the one who stood out.

251
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Princess Yao,

252
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
please explain.

253
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,360
What new emperor?

254
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
You should explain.

255
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Don't talk nonsense.

256
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Those people are still the people of Lanling Capital.

257
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,360
I feel ashamed to stand with them.

258
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Okay.

259
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
You all have your voice.

260
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
You all have your reason.

261
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
If that's the case,

262
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I will leave the family.

263
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,360
I will leave the family.

264
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

265
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
I think Wei Wuxian has been

266
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,360
in the mess of the river for a long time.

267
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
After all, with his current ability,

268
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,360
it's not hard to protect the independent government.

269
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
He wants to take this opportunity

270
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
to come to the sea and cross the sea.

271
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
He is a bird of the sky.

272
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

273
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,360
you are a warrior who has fought for thousands of years.

274
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Wei Wuxian,

275
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
he has been fighting for a long time.

276
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
He keeps causing you trouble.

277
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
It seems that he didn't put you in his heart.

278
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,360
He didn't care about your feelings.

279
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,360
No, Wei Wuxian has been like this since he was little.

280
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Even my father can't do anything to him.

281
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Brother Feng,

282
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,360
is there a way to take him?

283
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Brother Feng,

284
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
that's his love for him.

285
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

286
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,360
you are different from your father.

287
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,360
You have been in Jiang's family for years.

288
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
It's time for you to be in danger.

289
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,360
But he doesn't care about you.

290
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,360
How do you think of the new generation of Jiang family?

291
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Do you want them to treat him as a role model

292
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
and not put you in his eyes?

293
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Princess Jin,

294
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,360
I will go to Lanzang River to settle this matter.

295
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
That's right.

296
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

297
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,360
there are some things that you must not worry about.

298
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,360
And that bear tiger suit.

299
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
I will let him take it out.

300
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
I will give you an explanation.

301
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Okay, you all heard it.

302
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

303
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,360
you are so lucky.

304
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I am so glad to see you here.

305
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

306
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
you are so lucky.

307
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,360
Princess Jiangcheng,

308
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,560
Yourồiong, I definitely have some excitement mentally.

309
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,560
Right.

310
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,640
But...

311
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:36,640
You are so extremely much under the control of

312
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,840
the exhibition.

313
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
This Childe Wei is really so powerful.

314
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,360
How can he be a dead man?

315
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
From the words of the capital palace,

316
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Wei Wuxian indeed turned Wen Ning into a puppet.

317
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,360
This Wei Ying is too chaotic.

318
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,360
But the matter of the Yin Iron is still unknown.

319
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Maybe it wasn't done by Childe Wei.

320
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Who else is it?

321
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,360
This Wei Ying has a few abilities,

322
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
but he's still not leaving the town.

323
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,360
You want to be the Yin Iron?

324
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Yes, as you said.

325
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Wang Jing, do you know what you're doing?

326
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,360
You sneaked into the Imperial Library to do something.

327
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,360
I'm not punishing you. I'm just afraid you'll be able to change your mind.

328
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Since you've been pursuing Qiong Qi Da,

329
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,360
you've let Wei Wuxian go.

330
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Do you really want to make a mistake again?

331
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Where did you learn to recite the Jaxun?

332
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Let me ask you.

333
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,360
What's the 52nd Jaxun?

334
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Yan Jin taught Jinxi.

335
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Did you forget your father's Jaxun?

336
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
My mother...

337
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Shut up.

338
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
I'll go.

339
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Wang Jing, you're free.

340
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,360
I've always been like you in the West.

341
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,360
I've always been strict with you.

342
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,360
I hope you'll be a good person in the world.

343
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
I don't want you to be the burden of your father.

344
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,360
I'll end my words here.

345
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I hope you'll be free.

346
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Go.

347
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,360
The Imperial Library

348
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,360
The Imperial Library

349
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
The... The 3rd Department.

350
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
The Imperial Library

351
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Mr. Jin.

352
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Miss Jiang.

353
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Mr. Jin, I have to go to my brother.

354
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
I'll take my leave.

355
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
I don't mind.

356
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Miss Jiang, I...

357
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
I know what happened today.

358
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
But this is a matter of Wei Wuxian.

359
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Mr. Jin, I'm sorry for being so hard on you.

360
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Tomorrow...

361
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Tomorrow, I'll leave Jinling Tai with Cheng.

362
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,360
You're leaving? Where are you going?

363
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Are you going to Lanzang?

364
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Can you not go?

365
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Miss Jiang, stay here.

366
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Stay in Jinling Tai.

367
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
No matter what others say,

368
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,360
believe me, I'll take care of you forever.

369
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,360
The Imperial Library

370
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Miss Jiang.

371
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Miss Jiang.

372
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Miss Jiang.

373
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Wei Wuxian.

374
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Wei Wuxian.

375
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Wei Wuxian.

376
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Wei Wuxian.

377
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Wenqiang, you're so good at teaching.

378
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Wei Wuxian, why didn't you answer my call?

379
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,360
You know you've been here for three days and three nights.

380
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
What else do you want to ask?

381
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
You talk so much.

382
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
Then don't eat.

383
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
No, please.

384
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Oh, right.

385
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,360
He can hear you.

386
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
You talk to him more.

387
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
He might wake up earlier.

388
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
Ning.

389
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Can you hear me?

390
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Ning.

391
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
Ning.

392
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
Uncle.

393
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Young master Wei,

394
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
we're going to turn this place upside down.

395
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Yes, we can only do this to make the best of you.

396
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
This, this.

397
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Yuan, stop it.

398
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Talk, talk.

399
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Okay, okay, okay.

400
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Let go, let go.

401
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
Let go.

402
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Come, let's play.

403
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Yuan, if you follow me like this,

404
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I'll plant you as a radish in the ground.

405
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Yuan, you really want to be a radish?

406
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Okay, then don't move.

407
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
If you move, I won't plant it.

408
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Come on.

409
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Today, I'll plant a big radish.

410
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,360
In a few days, I'll be able to grow a lot of radishes.

411
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,360
If you come over, you'll all have them.

412
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,360
But I'm not a radish.

413
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Then plant a little friend.

414
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Take more water, eat more fat,

415
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
and more sun.

416
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Then you'll be able to plant a lot of little friends.

417
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,360
I want three little brothers, two little sisters.

418
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
No problem.

419
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Just give Yuan three little brothers, two little sisters.

420
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Are they the same as me or the same as the radish?

421
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
That's hard to say.

422
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Then do you want Yuan to be like you

423
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,360
or are they the same as the radish?

424
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Wei Wuxian.

425
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,360
What are you doing?

426
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Aunt, we're doing little brothers and little sisters.

427
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Yuan, how about we plant some more aunties?

428
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
When the time comes, we'll plant a lot of aunties

429
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
and we'll have no one to work.

430
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Get up.

431
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Wei Wuxian, I just left a small place.

432
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
You're so lucky.

433
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
You can't help but forget about the grudge between you and Yuan.

434
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
Yuan hasn't washed his clothes yet.

435
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
You've got dirty new clothes.

436
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
What's he wearing tomorrow?

437
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Wash his clothes today.

438
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Wash clothes are done by others.

439
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,360
How can I stop him?

440
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Do you want to wash it?

441
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Good.

442
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Chief, how is it?

443
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
It's a mess.

444
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
There are many things to do.

445
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
I can't get in.

446
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Wait here.

447
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
I'll go upstairs and have a look.

448
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Chief, it's dangerous to go up the mountain.

449
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
I'll go upstairs and have a look.

450
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
Plant potatoes.

451
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Plant radishes.

452
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
It's hard to eat radishes.

453
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
It's hard to eat radishes.

454
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,360
No, plant potatoes.

455
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
I said, I'll plant radishes.

456
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I said, I'll plant radishes.

457
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Jiang Cheng, you're here just in time.

458
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Tell me, is it good to plant radishes or potatoes?

459
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Why are you looking at me?

460
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Look at me.

461
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
What are you doing?

462
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Can't you see?

463
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
You're building a house.

464
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Building a house?

465
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,360
What were those people doing when you came up?

466
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Don't tell me you really plan to plant land.

467
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Didn't you see it?

468
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
You're planting land here.

469
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Can you eat it on a mountain?

470
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Trust me.

471
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
When people reach the limit,

472
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
you can eat anything.

473
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,360
You really plan to live here for a long time.

474
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Can this place stay?

475
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,360
I've lived here for three months.

476
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
You can't plant anything.

477
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Yun Meng is so close.

478
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
When do you want to go back?

479
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Just sneak back.

480
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Don't you think so?

481
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Where did you get this?

482
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
Take it away.

483
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
What?

484
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
Do you know how to use a word?

485
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Yuan, why did you hug me?

486
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
You just planted the land.

487
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Don't put your hand in your mouth.

488
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Do you know what land it is?

489
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Come here.

490
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Where's my grandma?

491
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Come here.

492
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Go to her.

493
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Grandma.

494
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Come here.

495
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Be careful.

496
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Let's go play with grandma.

497
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Those people thought you were a coward.

498
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
You came back to the Wudah.

499
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
You're a bunch of old men.

500
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360
You're so good at digging.

501
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,360
What are you talking about?

502
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
What are you talking about?

503
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Where's Wen Ning?

504
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Why do you suddenly think of asking her?

505
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
People come to ask me these days.

506
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
They ask who I am.

507
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Then I'll ask you.

508
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
What are you doing?

509
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Don't worry.

510
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Jiang Cheng is just here to see the old man.

511
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
He won't do anything to her.

512
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
He just came in.

513
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Don't touch him.

514
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
I know.

515
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Don't make trouble after you get in.

516
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Okay.

517
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
What are you doing?

518
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Go.

519
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Go.

520
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
Don't guess.

521
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm useful.

522
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I'll do it.

523
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Don't guess.

524
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm useful too.

525
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Sit down.

526
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
You're making trouble.

527
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Don't blame me for breaking it.

528
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
I'm living alone.

529
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
What's wrong with making trouble?

530
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
You're so stupid.

531
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
You live here?

532
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
Wen Ning.

533
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Wen Ning.

534
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Someone's here to see you.

535
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,360
He can actually hear you.

536
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
What's wrong with him?

537
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Didn't he say that

538
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
after you're revived,

539
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
you'll become a fierce and ruthless man?

540
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
You're killing people.

541
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Revived?

542
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Who's the person who's revived?

543
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Ning has been

544
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
killed by the Five-day Goddess.

545
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
So she was

546
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
killed by someone

547
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
who was a living dead.

548
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
We found her.

549
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
She's already dead.

550
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
She's lost her mind.

551
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
She's only a young girl.

552
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
I just want to use

553
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
the power of the Eagle Tiger.

554
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
I want to use Wen Ning's hand

555
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
to make a golden arrow.

556
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
But I didn't expect

557
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
she would become a puppet

558
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
and lose her heart.

559
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
If she loses her mind,

560
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
she can kill people without blinking?

561
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
Wen Ning is a coward.

562
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
She's often hidden

563
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
all kinds of emotions

564
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
in her heart.

565
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
After losing her mind,

566
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
all the pain,

567
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
anger,

568
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
anxiety,

569
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
and anxiety

570
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
in her heart

571
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
are all exposed.

572
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
What about now?

573
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
Now,

574
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
I'm trying to awaken her mind.

575
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
You're thinking about the future again?

576
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Is she still human?

577
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
What's the difference

578
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
between the time we killed her?

579
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Wei Wuxian,

580
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
are you...

581
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Jiang Cheng,

582
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
you're also suspecting

583
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
that I took that silver chain.

584
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
I'm not a thief.

585
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
I'm a thief.

586
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
I'm a thief.

587
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
I'm a thief.

588
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,360
I'm a thief.

589
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,360
I'm a thief.

590
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
I'm a thief.

591
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,360
I'm a thief.

592
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,360
I'm a thief.

593
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I'm a thief.

594
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
I'm a thief.

595
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,360
I'm a thief.

596
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,360
I'm a thief.

597
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
I'm a thief.

598
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,360
I'm a thief.

599
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,360
I'm a thief.

600
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
I'm a thief.

601
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm a thief.

602
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
I'm a thief.

603
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,360
I'm a thief.

604
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,360
I'm a thief.

605
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
I'm a thief.

606
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
You're all suspecting

607
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
that I took that silver chain

608
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
from Wei Wuxian?

609
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
No one is following me.

610
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Who's the thief?

611
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,420
you
