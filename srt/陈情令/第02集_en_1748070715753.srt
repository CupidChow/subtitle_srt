The fourth one is the first one to be released.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Bamboo.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Bamboo.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bamboo.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Bamboo.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you doing?

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Come on.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's weird.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why are you walking down the foot of the big mountain?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's still a little bit of a smell.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is your wheel broken?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll change it to a new one.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not even 10 miles away from here.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We're going to the big mountain.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We can't go first.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If we take someone first,

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
we can't make it to the top.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You two,

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What's the point of moving?

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The big mountain is also a place to sell the land first.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know why it's so deserted.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Recently, I heard that there's a stone soul sand.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it's also washed away the soul of the tree.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, I don't think so.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm afraid this place doesn't have a stone soul stone or a stone soul sand.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Look, all the stone soul sand

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
doesn't move at all.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If so,

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
how did the stone soul stone come?

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Could it be the problem with your stone soul sand?

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How is that possible?

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't you know who made this stone soul sand?

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What do you mean?

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Of course I know.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This stone soul sand was made for Wu Xian.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Isn't the stone soul sand that he made

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
beautiful?

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Can't I be suspicious?

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't say you can't be suspicious.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I didn't say that the stone soul sand he made

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
beautiful.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why are you so insincere?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The stone soul sand made by Wu Xian is not good.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He was good with me last year.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've never been suspicious.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why do you believe him so much?

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's your father.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's my idol.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Master, let's go.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Here.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Master.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sorry.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You want to eat apples?

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I won't give them to you.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you leaving?

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Little apples.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Little apples.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Little apples.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Did you hear that?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you hear that?

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll call you little apples.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll be right back.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Master.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Master.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Master.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Master.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Miss.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Master.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Master.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Master.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm begging you.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Stop.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Master.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Master.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Master.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mother.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's wrong with Miss Yan?

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yan is my daughter.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
She just got married a while ago.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
My husband is a dead ghost.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He went to the mountain to do his work that day.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yan insisted on going to the mountain to find her.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I didn't expect that he would change his life

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
when he came back from the mountain.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yan.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He doesn't eat or drink.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yan.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He doesn't know anyone.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yan.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yan.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Sometimes he can know someone.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He's crazy.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He always treats the mountain with drugs.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We did nothing.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yan is so nice.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
His father is a dead ghost.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He's been living a long time.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Help.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Help.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Help.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Help.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Help.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Help.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Help.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Help.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Help.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Help.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Help.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Help.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Help.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Help.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You always fool me.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't catch more than 400 dead ghosts in the mountain.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And you killed more than ten of them.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One of them is not worth much.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He actually killed more than 400 dead ghosts.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's really a golden stone.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please let us go.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let us go.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let us go.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let us go.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let us go.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You guys just hang up here.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't go anywhere.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Love me.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mr. Jing.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let us go.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When I catch the dead ghosts,

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll remind you.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll let you go.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mr. Jing.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let us go.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let us go.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let us go.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Little Pingguo.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Little Pingguo.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Little Pingguo.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Little Pingguo.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Little Pingguo.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Little Pingguo.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Little Pingguo.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Little Pingguo.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's you.

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What?

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know me?

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
After we got back from the old house,

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you were in the house?

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And now you're doing this?

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Uncle drove you away.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're so stupid.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now they dare to let you go.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I didn't expect

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
that Mo Xuan Yu

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is the real master of the old house.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Get out of here.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're disgusting.

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're a criminal.

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Who's a criminal?

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You're the one who said that.

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Get out of here.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're such a good girl.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What did you say?

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're so good.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ling Ling is a criminal.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're so evil.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You should be careful.

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do you know who's coming today?

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm so scared.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you don't come,

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll tell my uncle.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You'll be dead.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why is it your uncle?

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not your father.

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Who is your uncle?

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He's my uncle.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What else do you want?

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm not your father.

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm your uncle.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm your uncle.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm your uncle.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not your father.

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Who's your uncle?

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He's my uncle.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm your uncle.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What else do you want?

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Uncle.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Uncle.

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Uncle.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Stop.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Jin Ling.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why did you take so long?

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you want me to invite you up?

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How can you be so hard-working?

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Get lost.

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm going to break your dog's legs.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Break his legs?

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Didn't I tell you

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to kill your dog

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
with the help of the old man?

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I didn't see the emperor today.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So it's Mr. Lan Er.

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Master Jiang.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Lord Han,

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you're really a good man.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why are you here

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in the forest?

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I wonder if Mr. Lan

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is here to rob the palace

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
or to look for someone.

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In the past 16 years,

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mr. Lan Er has been

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
very busy.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Master Jiang, what do you mean?

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you mean?

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I think Mr. Lan Er

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
knows the most.

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Mr. Jin.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The nightclubs

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
are all fighting in peace.

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But Mr. Jin

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
is wandering around

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
on this big mountain.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He wants other families to

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
get rid of the problem

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and make it difficult for them.

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He's afraid of being in the trap.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So he's

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
thinking about the rules.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They're stupid.

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They're in the trap.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What can I do?

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's the problem?

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll talk to the hunter

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
when I catch him.

285
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Lan Er,

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
what do you mean?

287
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're not in the trap.

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Get rid of him.

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't be angry, Mr. Jiang.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mr. Lan Er's forbidden magic

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
won't hurt people.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
As long as he doesn't break the tree,

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
he'll be free

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
from the time he's in the trap.

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now?

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Master.

297
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Master.

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Master.

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Tell me.

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What bad news

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
do you want to tell me?

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A long time ago,

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
a blue light

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
broke your father's king.

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
How many?

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All.

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
More than 400 father's kings?

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Gu Su and Lan Shi

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
are so skilled.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
my father

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
is a real man.

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not a man.

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Jin Ling,

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I want to punish you.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let him do this.

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's not easy

318
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to get rid of him.

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Get down.

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

321
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What are you doing?

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Waiting for the hunter

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to catch you?

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,200
She has no need to lecture me.

325
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,560
President Jiang.

326
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,880
You are in Veteran Grandfather.

327
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,400
I will deal with the case separately.

328
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,480
No need.

329
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,640
Go and do something.

330
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Keep trying.

331
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,400
Don't stick to your weird strategy.

332
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,520
Yes, sir.

333
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hello?

334
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,880
Wei Wuxian.

335
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,160
Don't disturb me anymore?

336
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,300
A-Xin.

337
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,100
Come drink your soup.

338
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,720
Your favorite pie broth.

339
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
You know that this bread last night was so delicious.

340
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Wei Wuxian, you said you would help me.

341
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,440
You forgot that they have double illness.

342
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
We have double illness in our dreams.

343
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Xian, you, me, and Cheng.

344
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,440
We three will be together forever.

345
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
We will never be separated.

346
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Senior sister.

347
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Senior sister.

348
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Senior sister.

349
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Young master Jing and Jiang Jiang are all so used to him.

350
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
He is so young and so arrogant.

351
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
If he has a day of business, he will be in trouble.

352
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Let's not think about it.

353
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
He is not used to being so petty.

354
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
He is so small and he is like a father and a son.

355
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
What about a father and son?

356
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
How about a father and son?

357
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Everyone is like him.

358
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
But Jing Ling is so talented.

359
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
She is not full moon yet.

360
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Her father was killed by Wei Wuxian.

361
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Her mother Jiang Yanli was killed by Wei Wuxian.

362
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Jiang Yanli is so innocent.

363
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
She is so stupid.

364
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
No wonder Jiang Cheng hates you so much.

365
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
In these 16 years,

366
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
he will be so innocent if he is killed by Wei Wuxian.

367
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
He is also so innocent.

368
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
He is so innocent.

369
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
You are so naive.

370
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
You...

371
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Jing Ling is my sister's son.

372
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
How can I say that?

373
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
He thinks he is weak.

374
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,440
But he is so innocent.

375
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
As for the child,

376
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
he will be so innocent.

377
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Jun Tian's mother will be so innocent.

378
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
He is so RepeatStuff.

379
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
He is so konsumious.

380
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I can only sleep when he is irritated.

381
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
So he can rest by himself.

382
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
It is understandable because

383
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
he tried to be pure.

384
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
But they did something wrong.

385
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Hello?

386
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
What is it?

387
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Something happened,

388
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Oh,还以为抓到了什么邪遂

389
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
这只是 airport

390
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,440
谁?鬼鬼碎碎的

391
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
老张

392
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
您在此地做什么

393
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,080
我是聴守 up

394
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
聴守坟地地

395
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
还以为抓到了什么邪遂

396
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Old Zhang, how long have you been here?

397
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,440
I can't remember.

398
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,440
When I asked the master to let me come here,

399
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I didn't dare to leave.

400
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Later, there were many dead people.

401
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,440
There were many graves.

402
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
It was easy to find something.

403
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Is there anything strange about this mountain?

404
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes, there is.

405
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,440
You two, go to the top of the mountain and look at the sky.

406
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,440
There is a mountain of five thousand girls.

407
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,440
That's a stone.

408
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,440
It looks like a human.

409
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Isn't it strange?

410
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Zhang Chu, Master Wen,

411
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Master Wen, what did he say?

412
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Let's go to the sky to see what we can find.

413
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Master Wen, what did Master Wen say?

414
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Oh, right, that stone will move.

415
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,440
You know it's a stone.

416
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Little Apple.

417
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,440
This is the Green grass.

418
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Green grass can go to the soil and grow in the forest.

419
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,440
It usually grows with the cultivation of the bones.

420
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Is this the cultivation of the bones?

421
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
I didn't expect that you can eat this donkey.

422
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,440
It seems that the black flag is hidden here because of the cultivation of the bones.

423
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,440
The forest is often not here, but the grass is here.

424
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Master, what is the problem here?

425
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
I haven't found it.

426
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Master Wen, I haven't found it.

427
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Master Wen, what is the problem?

428
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Master Wen, what is the problem?

429
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Master Wen, what is the problem?

430
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Nothing. Master Wen, I haven't found it.

431
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Master Wen.

432
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Wei Wuxian.

433
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
This is the place where my family lives.

434
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,440
No, what's wrong?

435
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,440
It's not the stone.

436
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Oh, no, Jin Ling.

437
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Where is my wife?

438
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Where is my wife?

439
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Where is my wife?

440
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Where is my wife?

441
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Where is my wife?

442
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Where is my wife?

443
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I heard that hundreds of years ago,

444
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Buddha's Temple was in the mountains.

445
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
In the stone pit, there was a stone.

446
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
It was very similar to human.

447
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,440
It was made of four swords and five movements.

448
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
What else is there?

449
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,440
The stone head is made of five different shapes.

450
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
It's a girl with a smile.

451
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
The Buddha's Temple is famous for its great power.

452
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,440
It also published many legends.

453
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,440
The local people said that the goddess Xu Yan is very spiritual.

454
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
How could she be defeated like this?

455
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
She didn't even ask people to clean her up.

456
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
It was a piece of stone.

457
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I didn't know who put it here and sealed it.

458
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I also felt that it was a good place to be.

459
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,440
These villagers, they worship Buddha all day long.

460
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I didn't know that the Buddha was self-sufficient.

461
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Besides, it's a beautiful and beautiful goddess.

462
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
It's so beautiful.

463
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I'm Xu Yan now.

464
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
If something in the mountains of Dazhan is broken,

465
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
it will appear in front of me right now.

466
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Can she do it?

467
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Yes.

468
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Master Jin is right.

469
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
What's wrong with you?

470
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Wake up.

471
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Senior Mo.

472
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Get out of here.

473
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Be careful that this is a ghost god.

474
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
The goddess's self-sufficiency.

475
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
It's still cold.

476
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Run.

477
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Run.

478
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Children.

479
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Children, wait for me.

480
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Who are you, children?

481
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Do you know who we are?

482
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Okay.

483
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Dear brothers.

484
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Can you put a smoke bomb

485
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
to call your family...

486
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
Han Guangjun?

487
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Oh no.

488
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
The smoke bomb is in the Mojiazhuang.

489
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
It's all over.

490
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
You didn't put it on?

491
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I forgot.

492
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
You can forget it all?

493
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Let you know that Han Guangjun is waiting to be punished.

494
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Oh no.

495
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
If Han Guangjun is punished, he will die.

496
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Punish.

497
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Punish.

498
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Punish.

499
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Senior Mo.

500
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,440
How do you know that the one who is dying is the Five-day Goddess?

501
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
I saw it.

502
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
What did you see?

503
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
The ancient sect.

504
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,440
So I decided that it's not the Soul-Slaying God

505
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
or the Soul-Slaying Beast.

506
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Why?

507
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
You are so innocent.

508
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Can you teach me some fairy tales,

509
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
family stories,

510
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
history,

511
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
and such things that are too long and too long?

512
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Teach me some practical things.

513
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Soul-Slaying Beast and Soul-Slaying God

514
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
are the spiritual masters who are given the death

515
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
and the soul-slaying god.

516
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Let me ask you.

517
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Why did you sacrifice so many

518
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
immortal and immortal bones

519
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
to make them die?

520
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
It seems reasonable.

521
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Wait.

522
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
You are not crazy.

523
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Where is Miss Yan?

524
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Let me ask you again.

525
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,440
A married couple is about to be separated.

526
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
What will she do

527
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
if she is a weak woman?

528
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
The Soul-Slaying God?

529
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Yes.

530
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
And Miss Yan

531
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
has a special place.

532
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Why is there only her soul-slaying god

533
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
among all the people?

534
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Well...

535
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Miss Yan's father

536
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
has been killed by the Soul-Slaying God.

537
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Miss Yan's father,

538
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
a father who loves his daughter,

539
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
knows that her daughter's soul-slaying god is gone.

540
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,440
She is useless and has no means to save her.

541
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
What will she do?

542
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
I know.

543
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
She went to the Soul-Slaying God, too.

544
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,440
So she went to the Soul-Slaying God's temple.

545
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
She wants my daughter's soul-slaying god

546
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
to be found.

547
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
That's right.

548
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
The Five-Slaying Goddess

549
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
threw her soul-slaying god's soul-slaying god out.

550
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
So her soul-slaying god is damaged.

551
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
That's why

552
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
she will imitate the Five-Slaying Goddess's soul-slaying god.

553
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
She will even be filial.

554
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
So the soul-slaying god

555
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
is now in my wish.

556
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
I want to take a look at the things

557
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
in the Mount of the Great Fan

558
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
and show up right away

559
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
and let the Five-Slaying Goddess revive.

560
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
The soul-slaying god?

561
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
Did you see the soul-slaying god?

562
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
How could the soul-slaying god

563
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
have the complete soul-slaying god?

564
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
No.

565
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
I've already sealed her with the Blue-Eyes.

566
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Why is she alive?

567
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Master Jin,

568
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
send out the signal you have.

569
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Master Jin!

570
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Why are you pulling my sword?

571
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Master Jin!

572
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
It's already this time.

573
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
What are you still blowing?

574
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
I can't hear you.

575
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
You're still a lunatic.

576
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
What?

577
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Wen Ning.

578
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Wen Ning is dead, right?

579
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,440
What's going on?

580
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
What's going on?

581
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
What the hell is this?

582
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
General Gui!

583
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
General Gui, it's Wen Ning!

584
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Wen Ning,

585
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
didn't you just

586
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
go back to the wrong place

587
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
16 years ago?

588
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
What's wrong with you?

589
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Did you go back?

590
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
No,

591
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
this is a illusion.

592
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Who created this illusion?

593
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Why is it so dangerous?

594
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Is it just to

595
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
get me out of Wen Ning?

596
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
The Five-Sister-In-Law disappeared?

597
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
This...

598
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
This is fake.

599
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
What?

600
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Stop her!

601
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Everyone,

602
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
don't let her run away.

603
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
This is Wen Ning!

604
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
What are you afraid of?

605
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
Don't be afraid.

606
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
The Ghost-Demon Master is not here.

607
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Yes.

608
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
What's there to be afraid of?

609
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Her master

610
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
has been killed by the Thirteen-Thousand-Million-Dies.

611
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Kill!

612
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Kill!

613
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Yubs.

614
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
The Immune Deity techniques

615
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:30,440
will、ckeld her so much.

616
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Typhoon signing into her Nasus.

617
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Trying to heal me is my warning.

618
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,220
Who is this person?

619
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,200
Who can call my name?

620
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
ings

621
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,360
Supervisor

622
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,420
Lun

623
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:25,560
Isatter

624
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,120
Alliance

625
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,140
hil

626
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,140
Media

627
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,540
Airf الد

628
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,120
An Airfêde

629
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,720
Only one

630
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,960
The day I did my best

631
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Rehearsal

632
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,120
When I was familiar with

633
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,760
You didn't ask me to take it.

634
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Shut up!

635
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
Chief... Chief.

636
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,640
What the hell is this?

637
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,280
You killed him so easily.

638
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,640
Chief, it's... it's Wen Ning.

639
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,400
What did you say?

640
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
Wen Ning is back.

641
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
Wen Ning?

642
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,000
It's Wen Ning.

643
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,960
Qian Chen Wen Que.

644
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,360
This thing has been killed by the wrong Gu Yang Hui.

645
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,520
How could he come back?

646
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,600
It's really Wen Ning.

647
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,720
I don't think he's wrong.

648
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,280
He's the one who caught it.

649
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,080
Wen Ning that time!

650
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Great!

651
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
You're back.

652
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,920
媳 Shop, don't you dare stop me!!

653
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,900
whereby the magic室 is enabled by the 12th bloodsticks !

654
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Let's goo

655
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,040
What, there's nothing to scratch that you can make that's all you get

656
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,540
So use it to support yourself

657
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,700
How does that even make sense, right?

658
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,860
I'll take your face off!

659
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,360
No, you...

660
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
I'm afraid I'll scare you to death!

661
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,980
Enough, Chief Jiang!

662
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,480
That's a Purple Palace!

663
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,780
As long as it's the one who took the shot,

664
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,440
the Purple Palace will be out of danger.

665
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,940
And after Wei Wuxian died,

666
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,140
he couldn't find the corpse,

667
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,640
so he couldn't even get the soul back.

668
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,480
Unless he took the shot,

669
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,980
it's impossible for him to come back.

670
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
How do you know he's really dead?

671
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Didn't Chief Jiang take the shot?

672
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Tell me!

673
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Who are you?

674
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Wei Wuxian!

675
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Go to hell!

676
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Sometimes,

677
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,900
I really want to go back to the sixteen years ago.

678
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
I really want to go back to the sixteen years ago.

679
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
I want to go back to the Lotus Dance.

680
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Even if I have a dream,

681
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
I don't want to wake up.

682
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
Ah Xie!

683
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Ah Xie!

684
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Ah Xie!

685
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Ah Xie!

686
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,900
If you can't get up, let go of me!

687
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
Dog!

688
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Dad, you're out of the game!

689
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Don't sit there, Ah Xie.

690
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
We're here!

691
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Wait for me!

692
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
I'm coming!

693
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
Sister, we're here.

694
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
We haven't arrived at the Cloud Recesses.

695
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,900
This is the Caiyi Town.

696
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
I wonder if there's anything fun in the Caiyi Town.

697
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
We're going to the school.

698
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Your mom is just playing around.

699
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,900
She's not allowed to be called a hostage.

700
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Okay, you two.

701
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
It's not like you're at home.

702
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
You should be careful.

703
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Sister, look at her.

704
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
What's wrong with me?

705
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
I want this.

706
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Come in, come in, come in.

707
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Sister, look.

708
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Little rabbit.

709
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Is it fun?

710
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
It's fun.

711
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,900
Wei Wuxian, you're still playing?

712
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,900
We're going to the Cloud Recesses.

713
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
This time, we're going to attend

714
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
all the students of the world.

715
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,900
But don't let everyone see us

716
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
because you're alone.

717
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,900
I see.

718
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
By the way, you guys have heard it too.

719
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,900
From now on,

720
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
our actions and etiquette

721
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
represent the face of our

722
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
future Cloud Recesses.

723
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Yes.

724
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Yes.

725
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,900
Wei Wuxian, did you hear that?

726
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Sister, we've been coming from the Cloud Recesses

727
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
to the Cloud Recesses.

728
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
Why don't we find a inn

729
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
to look for a place to stay

730
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
and then go to Cloud Recesses?

731
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,900
This is not the style of our Cloud Recesses.

732
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
It's good.

733
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
There are still ten days left to go.

734
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
We'll stay here for a while

735
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
until we get back to the Cloud Recesses.

736
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
We're going to stay here.

737
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
I heard that the most famous

738
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
of the Celestial Prime is the Celestial Lord.

739
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
The entrance is pure and the entrance is easy to get.

740
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
I've been playing for a long time.

741
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,900
I can finally get it today.

742
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Wei Wuxian, don't drink.

743
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,900
I'm going to drink.

744
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
Besides, Xiaozhou is a lover.

745
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,900
Why don't you let me drink?

746
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
You...

747
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Father shouldn't have let you come to the Cloud Recesses.

748
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Okay, you two.

749
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Stop fighting.

750
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Let's find a inn first.

751
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Wei Wuxian, let me tell you again.

752
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
I know.

753
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
I'm getting tired of it.

754
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
I'm going now.

755
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Wei...

756
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Sister, look at him.

757
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
I have a feeling that

758
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,900
he will definitely make the Cloud Recesses

759
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
into a mess this time.

760
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,900
Xian is a lively woman.

761
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
It's not a good thing to do.

762
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Father often says that.

763
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,900
Sister, you and father

764
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
always talk to him.

765
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
His temperament can't be changed.

766
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Besides,

767
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
our Yunmeng's family

768
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
is always called

769
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
to be self-centered.

770
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,900
I'm going to drink.

771
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,900
