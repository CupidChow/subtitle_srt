1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000

The fifth one is the first one.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The four of them is the first one.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000

The seventh one is the first one.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Number two, point four.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why is he still not here?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,920
來點什麼?

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,420
Xie Yu audio

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,200
objective

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,720
Drink some

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Turn around and on the ground.

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
William.

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:42,960
You're the only one here.

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,220
Yeah

51
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,700
Honey

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,820
Eh

53
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,820
I really need

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Oh

55
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Oh

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Oh

57
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,260
Come on, come on, come on, do you want to eat lotus seed

58
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
Oh

59
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Cheng, come here

60
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Come over here

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Mother

62
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,060
Cheng

63
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Come on, let me see

64
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,580
Cheng, have you practiced well?

65
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,780
Really good

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,780
What's in your hand?

67
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Look, how good you are, Cheng.

68
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,780
Come, kiss me.

69
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,780
You are so good.

70
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,780
Come, let me try your arm.

71
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,780
So good.

72
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Cheng, you are the master of the lotus house.

73
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,780
No.

74
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Cheng.

75
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Cheng.

76
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Cheng.

77
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Master Luo.

78
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Master Luo.

79
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
Xiao Wei.

80
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Wei Ying.

81
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Thank you for saving my life.

82
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,780
The End

83
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,780
You know where Jiang Cheng is, right?

84
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
What?

85
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,780
I don't want to say.

86
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,780
You can't save him.

87
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Jiang Cheng is just a useless person.

88
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,780
You are doomed.

89
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,780
Master, you are so mean.

90
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,780
You should be the master of the lotus house.

91
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,780
So, I am in a good mood today.

92
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,780
You just need to climb the ground.

93
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,780
I will let you go.

94
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Wei, what are you looking at?

95
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Master Wan asked you to kneel.

96
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
Can't you understand?

97
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I am sorry.

98
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,780
I only heard a noise.

99
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,780
I didn't hear a person's voice.

100
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Did you hear that?

101
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,780
He is dead.

102
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Master Wan, you promised me before.

103
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
You should thank him for his arm.

104
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
He owes us a arm.

105
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
No.

106
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
No.

107
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,780
It's boring to thank him for his bleeding.

108
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Stop.

109
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,780
I asked Master Wan to draw his order.

110
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,780
I want to hear him say the same thing to Jiang Cheng.

111
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,780
Okay.

112
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,780
Then I will draw his order and then I will do it.

113
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Thank you for your kindness.

114
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,780
If you need anything, just tell me.

115
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,780
You said it.

116
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,780
You are a hero.

117
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,780
I am not afraid of dying because I want to die.

118
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,780
I am afraid that I can't die.

119
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,780
If you are capable, you will die like this.

120
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
The more cruel you are, the better you will be.

121
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,780
After I die, I will be a ghost.

122
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,780
I will go to the mountain to ask the world about you.

123
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,780
The world is a world where the soul-saving spirit is not a ghost.

124
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,780
Don't listen to him.

125
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Then you are wrong, Master Wan.

126
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,780
I am not a son of the Jiang family.

127
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,780
I have no chance to be a soul-saving spirit.

128
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,780
If I die, I will be a ghost.

129
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
You should be careful.

130
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Shut up.

131
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
How can you say such a thing?

132
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,780
This person is buried in the ground with a white tiger after he died.

133
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Master Wan, we have been catching people everywhere for so long.

134
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
Isn't it just to punish him?

135
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Is it because he is talking nonsense?

136
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Did you just let him go?

137
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Of course not.

138
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,780
You are pretending to be me.

139
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Who are you scaring?

140
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
Master Wan.

141
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,780
Wait.

142
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,780
Master Wan, we have been caught so easily.

143
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,780
It's a pity that we are so unlucky.

144
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Our luck has just started.

145
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Master Wei,

146
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,780
in the Xuanwu Cave, the hero saved you.

147
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,780
You really hurt the new family.

148
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,780
Wei Ying, do you think you are a god?

149
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
I am a god.

150
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,780
I am a god.

151
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
I am a god.

152
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
I am a god.

153
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
I am a god.

154
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Wei Ying, do you think you are a god?

155
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,780
You are brave and great.

156
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,780
I didn't expect you to say such a thing.

157
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
You are good at talking.

158
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Then I will see when you will be a hero.

159
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Wen Zhu Liu,

160
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,780
get him out of here.

161
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Master Wei,

162
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,780
I am a god.

163
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
I am a god.

164
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
I am a god.

165
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
I am a god.

166
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
I am a god.

167
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
I am a god.

168
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,780
I am a god.

169
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
I am a god.

170
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
I am a god.

171
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,780
I am a god.

172
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
I am a god.

173
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
I am a god.

174
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
I am a god.

175
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
I am a god.

176
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Why are these people from Qinshan?

177
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Why are they coming here?

178
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
They are the ancestors.

179
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
They are the ordinary people.

180
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
I heard that Yunmeng is destroyed.

181
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,780
It seems that the world is going to be in chaos.

182
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Wei Ying,

183
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
do you know where we are?

184
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
We are in Yiling.

185
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,780
This place is called the Chaos Hall.

186
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,780
You Yunmen,

187
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
are you here to kill the people?

188
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Yes.

189
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,780
I am here to kill the people.

190
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,780
But I am not here to kill them.

191
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
I am here to kill them.

192
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
I am here to kill them.

193
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,780
You are here to kill them.

194
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
You Yunmeng must have heard about it.

195
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Even if it is a mountain,

196
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,780
it is a battlefield.

197
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,780
You can dig a stone out of it.

198
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,780
You can throw a stone here

199
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,780
if you have many people.

200
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Look at this black aura.

201
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,780
It is powerful and strong.

202
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
It is strong.

203
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Even our Wen clan can't control it.

204
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
So we can only make it out of the world.

205
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Let me tell you again.

206
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
It is daytime now.

207
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,780
It is really dark

208
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
when it is night.

209
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
People come here.

210
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
People bring their souls.

211
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
It is not a good idea to come out.

212
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Wei Ying,

213
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,780
I think you will come out when you are ready.

214
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,780
I will make you never come out.

215
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
No.

216
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,780
No.

217
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
No.

218
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
Go in.

219
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
No.

220
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
No.

221
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,780
No.

222
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
No.

223
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
No.

224
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Sister.

225
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
Mother, how are you?

226
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Are you okay?

227
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Sister, I didn't tell them anything.

228
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
I'll go.

229
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
Sister,

230
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,780
is Childe Wei okay?

231
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Did Young Master Jiang's gold egg

232
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,780
bring it back?

233
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,780
Never

234
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Sister

235
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,280
is Childe Wei?

236
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,780
How come?

237
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:06,780
Childe Wei

238
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,280
Married

239
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Brother!

240
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Wei Mu Ze!

241
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Wei Mu Ze!

242
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Wei Ying.

243
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Wei Ying.

244
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Wei Ying.

245
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Wei Ying.

246
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Wei Ying.

247
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Do you want to revenge?

248
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
No.

249
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Let's all together.

250
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Wei Mu Ze, Wei Mu Ze.

251
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I can't stand it anymore.

252
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I can't stand it anymore.

253
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
I can't stand it anymore.

254
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
I can't stand it anymore.

255
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
I can't stand it anymore.

256
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I can't stand it anymore.

257
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
I can't stand it anymore.

258
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
I can't stand it anymore.

259
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,280
I can't stand it anymore.

260
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,280
I can't stand it anymore.

261
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I can't stand it anymore.

262
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
I can't stand it anymore.

263
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,280
Eh, it's overcome.

264
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
We can't stand it anymore!

265
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
It's overcome.

266
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
That's what I said.

267
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
It's overcome.

268
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
We can't stand it anymore.

269
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,280
No more happiness from me.

270
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
It's the same thing...

271
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
I think I'll die.

272
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
After that...

273
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Everyone, you can't stand it anymore.

274
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,900
...this affect.

275
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,840
Wei Wu County wants revenge.

276
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,800
...

277
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,180
You have proc'.

278
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,980
Now where are all this fraud again?

279
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
That Jiang Cheng,

280
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
a golden bullet,

281
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,980
was directly left to Hua Mei by the Wen Zhu.

282
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
What a family!

283
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
I'm a loser!

284
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,980
I'm not a loser!

285
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Boss, boss.

286
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
That...

287
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
That young man with a scar on his head.

288
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,980
What's his name?

289
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Wei... Wei Wuxian.

290
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,980
I remember his name.

291
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Wei Wuxian.

292
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
That's him.

293
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
What a bastard!

294
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Come on.

295
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,980
He's a family.

296
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,980
In the tea house in Yiling,

297
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,980
we all look for him like a bastard.

298
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,980
He's so cute.

299
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
You've never seen him before.

300
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
He's not like that.

301
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Do you think he can still climb up and be a good man?

302
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Boss, you're good.

303
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
You're good.

304
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Come on.

305
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Cheers.

306
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Cheers.

307
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
I think

308
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
we're all being killed by the Jiang clan.

309
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,980
He's a bastard.

310
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,980
What the hell is he?

311
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Right.

312
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Come on.

313
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
Let's drink.

314
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Cheers.

315
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Who's there?

316
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,980
I can't pretend to be a bastard.

317
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
Who's there?

318
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Could it be Wei Wuxian?

319
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Boss, it's Boss.

320
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
Someone's coming.

321
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
Come on.

322
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Come on.

323
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
Come on.

324
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Come on.

325
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Wei Wuxian.

326
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Where's Wei Ying?

327
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Yu'an.

328
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Tell me.

329
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
I'll tell you.

330
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,980
Wei Wuxian was thrown into the cold.

331
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,980
Now, he's a bastard.

332
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
We're all in danger.

333
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,980
We can't get away from this.

334
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Don't worry.

335
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Don't worry.

336
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Let's go.

337
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Let's go.

338
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
Let's go.

339
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Let's go.

340
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,980
Let's go.

341
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
Let's go.

342
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Let's go.

343
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Let's go.

344
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,980
Go.

345
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Go.

346
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
Go.

347
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Go.

348
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Go.

349
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Come on.

350
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,980
Go.

351
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,180
I dreamed of him!

352
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,140
He has been thrown into the mess for more than three months.

353
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,300
You still dream of him?

354
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,140
How many times have you dreamt of him?

355
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,140
I don't know.

356
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,380
I don't know why I've been always dreaming of him.

357
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,540
Then don't sleep.

358
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,420
Sir!

359
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,340
Sir!

360
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,220
I've been thinking about one more question.

361
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Will we make a big mistake?

362
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,700
Will we throw him into the mess?

363
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,620
Will he die?

364
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,380
Will he...

365
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,060
No!

366
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,740
Have we sent many people to the New Year's Eve mess?

367
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,380
Has anyone come back?

368
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,420
He was thrown there.

369
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,220
I'm afraid he's already in a mess.

370
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,980
If he dies,

371
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,420
just like what he said,

372
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,580
what if he comes back to us and becomes a ghost?

373
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,940
What if he comes back to us?

374
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,980
Don't be so scared.

375
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,140
You're not scared of me.

376
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,700
You don't think I'm annoyed?

377
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,700
You have the ability to take care of things for years.

378
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,380
What breaking the schedule?

379
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,580
It's like everyone has their own way.

380
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,100
Even thinking they've abandoned the sun

381
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,980
makes your mind stand up.

382
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,780
Miss Wen...

383
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,980
The goods of their pavilion

384
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,300
outnumbered quickly the recent days.

385
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,940
I assume you should keep your eyes peeled for them...

386
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,660
Shut up!

387
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,300
Miss Wen...

388
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
What's wrong?

389
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,300
You're even afraid of the warm love?

390
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
I'm telling you, that crab-like dog

391
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,300
is just a walking dog of our Qishan Envoy.

392
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,300
How big can it be?

393
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
No!

394
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
No!

395
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
No!

396
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
No!

397
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
No!

398
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
No!

399
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
No!

400
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
No!

401
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
No!

402
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
No!

403
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
No!

404
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Who's there?

405
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Young Master.

406
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
What a strange thing.

407
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
What's wrong?

408
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Young Master, the Master of the Envoy is here.

409
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
I know. I'll be right there.

410
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Young Master!

411
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Young Master!

412
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
Young Master!

413
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Don't leave me here alone!

414
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
I'm afraid of you!

415
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Young Master!

416
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Young Master!

417
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Master Sita.

418
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Ju...Jue Lan Ling.

419
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
The day of the birth.

420
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
The Envoy of the Envoy is Qing He.

421
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Qing He is the master.

422
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,300
Next...

423
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Yu Ji Zhao,

424
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
the w horrifyingang,

425
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,300
you seen sometime when they rode

426
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,300
alreadyuu,

427
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
waiting for me?

428
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Waiter,

429
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
叻美好呢?

430
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Ah,

431
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
He really fell into a mess?

432
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Second Young Master.

433
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
Second Young Master, this is your compensation.

434
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Second Young Master, this is your compensation.

435
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Wei Ying.

436
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Where are you?

437
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Second Young Master.

438
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Wen Xu is dead.

439
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,300
I didn't expect that this kind of honor from the Shi Feng Sect

440
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
would cut down Wen Xu's head if it can be cut down.

441
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Brother Tang.

442
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Why did you waste the paper and put it in the room?

443
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,300
These things can't be eaten in these places.

444
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,300
How about we let them have a meal today?

445
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Is there anyone else in this nine states?

446
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,300
Send the order to let our men help to collect the Shi Hai.

447
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Come.

448
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Clean up the mess.

449
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Yes.

450
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
I don't care.

451
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm going to fight you.

452
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Miss Jiang, we're here.

453
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,300
These jade jade jade is a gift from Young Master Jin.

454
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,300
I've been taking care of Young Master Jin.

455
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Now that we're in Qinghe,

456
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,300
I'll leave you alone.

457
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Miss Jiang.

458
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Miss Jiang.

459
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Wei Weixian entrusted you to me.

460
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Lan Ling.

461
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,300
I think I'll be here when Jiang Cheng comes.

462
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Cheng.

463
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
You have Cheng's news.

464
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Cheng.

465
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Cheng.

466
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,300
You're back.

467
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,300
You're back.

468
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Cheng.

469
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Mr. Lan.

470
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Congratulations on your success.

471
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
This is...

472
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
This is Wei Weixian's gift.

473
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Could it be...

474
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,300
The Xu Mountain Education Department has burned it.

475
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
I'm sorry.

477
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
It's great.

478
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,300
I've brought some young master Jin here.

479
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,300
I wanted to discuss with you.

480
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
I'll go with you to the Qi Mountain Education Department.

481
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
I'm glad you're here.

482
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
By the way,

483
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
where's Wei Weixian?

484
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
He asked me to take care of him.

485
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Now he can go back to Zhao.

486
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Where's Wei Weixian?

487
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Where's Wei Weixian?

488
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Where's Wei Weixian?

489
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
Where's Wei Weixian?

490
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,300
The master of the Wen Clan is so cruel.

491
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
No wonder he's so cruel.

492
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300
He killed the son of Wen Rouhan.

493
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
He's now a traitor.

494
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
He's now a general.

495
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
If I don't kill the master of the Wen Clan,

496
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
I'll be in trouble.

497
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Good.

498
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
He killed a long life.

499
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
He's a man of the Wen Clan.

500
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
He's going to die.

501
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Now, the investigation on Langya and Qinghe has been published.

502
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
The Zou Army has taken the son of Lan of Qingshuai

503
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
and returned to the Yunshen Tribe.

504
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
I'm sure they'll be able to stabilize the Gu Su family soon.

505
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Then there's only Yun Meng and Yiling.

506
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Master, please wait.

507
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Master, please wait.

508
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Master, please wait.

509
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Yiling.

510
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Yiling.

511
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Yiling is the master of the West.

512
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
He's in the Wota of Qishan.

513
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
He's in a difficult situation.

514
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Master.

515
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Okay, you guys go.

516
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
We'll be up tomorrow.

517
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
But we must leave the road

518
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
in case we get into trouble.

519
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Master Jin.

520
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Master Jin.

521
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
What can I do for you?

522
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,300
Meng Yao is in a difficult situation.

523
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Meng Yao?

524
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
She's not in the Wota of Qishan.

525
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Why did she come to the Wota of Qishan?

526
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
What?

527
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
Since the time that Lan Shicong died,

528
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
I've never seen Meng Yao before.

529
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
And...

530
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Father...

531
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Father won't...

532
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Father won't...

533
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
I'll leave now.

534
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
Sister, it's so late.

535
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Why don't you get some rest?

536
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
It's so hard to see you.

537
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
You're leaving tomorrow.

538
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,300
I can't sleep even if I want to.

539
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Sister.

540
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
It's all my fault.

541
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,300
I couldn't take good care of you.

542
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,300
You're always worried about us.

543
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
I'm sorry.

544
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm not worried.

545
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300
My A'Cheng has grown up.

546
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
I can't do anything right now.

547
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I can only worry for you.

548
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Drink it while it's hot.

549
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Sister, it's so good.

550
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
A'Cheng.

551
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,300
You must bring A'Xian back.

552
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
I'll bring her back.

553
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
What's the matter?

554
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,300
How could he be dead?

555
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Master, he's dead.

556
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
And...

557
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,300
Uncle Xian told you to bring A'Cheng back.

558
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Bring A'Cheng back?

559
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
What's wrong with him?

560
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,300
He has a left-right arm.

561
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
He's very skinny.

562
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,300
Why did you ask me to go back?

563
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Let him solve this mess.

564
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
What's the matter?

565
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,300
I can't die.

566
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
I can't die.

567
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,300
I can't die on his arm.

568
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,300
No, no, no.

569
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
