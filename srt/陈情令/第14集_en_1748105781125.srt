1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The last time

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Part 5

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 1

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Mr. Li

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you awake?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, it seems like a veryствен

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm already here.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm afraid you'll be nervous.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
So I brought you here.

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
I just went to the bottom of the pond.

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,300
I found that guy very clever.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,300
He found me after a long time.

41
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
I haven't found the hole in Jiangcheng.

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
I'm worried that monster has blocked it.

43
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,300
You shouldn't have fallen asleep.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not that anxious.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But you, I asked you for the medicine.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How is it?

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Jiangcheng has been away for so long.

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I don't know how long it will take to find the original hand.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
I guess we still have to stay in this hole for a while.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,000
And fight with that monster.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
You see that monster, the Saint Fox, the King.

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
The King of the Big King.

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
A kind of monster is that kind of monster.

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
A monster?

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
You mean the Saint Fox?

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
The Saint Fox is called the Saint Fox.

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
It's a snake that is a river and a water god.

58
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Exactly.

59
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
How can a Saint Fox be so big?

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
He's still eating the teeth.

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
It's too far from what I thought.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Of course it's not a real Saint Fox.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But I've heard that a snake is similar to a fake Xuanwu.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Fake Xuanwu?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is it?

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you remember the one that Lan Yi mentioned before?

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The Saint Fox.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The Saint Fox?

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
The Saint Fox.

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
The Saint Fox controls a monster with a strong bone.

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
It's a fake Xuanwu.

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
I remember now.

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
You said it's similar to the King of the Big King.

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Could it be that the King of the Big King

75
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
is the fake Xuanwu that the Saint Fox left hundreds of years ago?

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Exactly.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Forget it.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What the hell is he?

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Didn't we say that we would take advantage of him?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If we kill the King today,

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
it's a good thing that we're out of the name.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Even if the unlucky person is killed by him,

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it's a hundred years or a thousand years.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, no.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a ten thousand years of monster killing.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's not embarrassing to tell, right?

87
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
The Saint Fox.

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
The Saint Fox.

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
The Saint Fox.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's a new record.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The Candidate Qi Xian's direct kiss.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Could I go closer?

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The Gesprod 1946.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,920
Or copy?

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,040
We can do that with our hands.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,920
Very good, Bai.

97
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,880
How about this?

98
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Let's take it with us.

99
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,600
Press so long.

100
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,840
Shall we go first?

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Do we need to make the char cry?

102
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,440
Only Selective Hero 곧 late is useless.

103
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,800
Restrain the HP Aaa-ing.

104
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,680
No more in this house.

105
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,680
I think it's save.

106
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,860
I have a punishment.

107
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,980
Save?

108
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,900
What punishment?

109
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,460
Where?

110
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,960
Where?

111
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,160
The P simplify

112
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,000
with Bebe and the haunted ghost.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,520
You know Karz NOW!

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,860
the需要

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,580
is to find this weak point

116
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,440
shut down the lecture

117
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,720
to disp eldest

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,960
for a husband

119
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,760
can glue

120
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,160
Let's go.

121
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,220
At the end of the road,

122
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,900
be careful.

123
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
How is it?

124
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
You didn't come in.

125
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Even if you don't spit it out,

126
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
it will be fainted.

127
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
He's stirring with�えー

128
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,040
at the visor

129
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,400
Lan Zhan

130
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,320
Lan Zhan.

131
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,760
It's a bother that I hadn't a choice.

132
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Only Drielстр's body was eaten up,

133
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,720
and passed over herателя to the silver.

134
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,920
It's the same like Enry.

135
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
and dive across the rock between the Bry desired.

136
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
What are you doing?

137
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Look!

138
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I miss you.

139
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,100
This thorn-s姿 seems to be trapped in here.

140
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Here.

141
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,780
What the hell?!

142
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,660
Nan-Chi!

143
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,840
shines

144
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,500
bright

145
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,700
there

146
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,700
sun is shining

147
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,640
sky in the reflection

148
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,420
bottom of the pool

149
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
stars in the mid mid

150
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,000
sun of red

151
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,820
burning

152
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

153
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

154
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

155
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

156
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

157
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

158
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

159
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

160
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

161
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

162
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

163
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

164
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

165
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

166
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

167
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

169
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

170
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

171
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

172
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

173
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,820
As the other one uses the same thing as the other one.

174
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

175
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

176
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,820
I'm going to use the same thing as the other one.

177
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Wei Ying, Wei Ying.

178
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Wake up, wake up.

179
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Congratulations, father.

180
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
You have a great skill.

181
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
You can bring the whole family to the world.

182
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Tell Wen Xun to find Xue Yang and...

183
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,820
...and find Xue Yang and...

184
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,820
...all the people related to Xue Yang and Qing He.

185
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Find out.

186
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Yes.

187
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
But father, I don't understand anything.

188
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
You have found three silver sticks.

189
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Why do you need to find the last one?

190
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
No matter how strong the three silver sticks are,

191
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,820
they can't be controlled by a broken iron.

192
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
I understand.

193
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
If Xue Yang and Xue Yang are broken,

194
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
even if we use three silver sticks,

195
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
they can't be controlled by a broken iron.

196
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I'll do it now.

197
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Go.

198
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Is he dead?

199
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Lan Zhan, is he dead?

200
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,820
He's dead.

201
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
He's dead.

202
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
He's really dead.

203
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
He's really dead.

204
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
Lan Zhan.

205
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
Lan Zhan.

206
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I heard that many people are begging me to...

207
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
...be good to me.

208
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
I'm not dreaming, am I?

209
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
No.

210
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
I didn't expect that...

211
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,820
...I can see you in my eyes.

212
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
Lan Zhan,

213
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,820
I thought I couldn't live.

214
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
I thought I could die.

215
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
I thought I could die.

216
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
I thought I could die.

217
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Wei Ying,

218
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
let go of me.

219
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Lan Zhan,

220
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
it's so comfortable.

221
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
It's so boring.

222
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Why is this stinky guy still not here?

223
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
It's so quiet.

224
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,820
Lan Zhan,

225
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
can you sing for me?

226
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

227
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Lan Zhan,

228
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
I'm sorry.

229
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Lan Zhan,

230
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
I'm sorry.

231
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
It's so nice.

232
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
It's so nice.

233
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Lan Zhan,

234
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,820
what's the name of this song?

235
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Lan Zhan,

236
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,820
Lan Zhan,

238
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
I'm sorry.

239
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,820
Lan Zhan,

240
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
I'm sorry.

241
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
Lan Zhan,

242
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
I'm sorry.

243
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Lan Zhan,

244
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
I'm sorry.

245
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
Lan Zhan,

246
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
I'm sorry.

247
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Lan Zhan,

248
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
I'm sorry.

249
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
Lan Zhan,

250
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
I'm sorry.

251
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Lan Zhan,

252
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,820
Wu Xin,

253
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
wake up.

254
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
You're too heavy.

255
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
I'm even heavier than you.

256
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
It's you.

257
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Don't misunderstand. I didn't come to save you.

258
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,820
I should thank you for that.

259
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Wei Wuxian! You're awake!

260
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Jiang Cheng.

261
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
Wei Wuxian, you're finally awake!

262
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,820
Jiang Cheng, you little bastard.

263
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
Where's your uncle?

264
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Where's Lan Zhan?

265
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
He's gone.

266
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
He's gone?

267
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
He's still injured.

268
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Who's injured?

269
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,820
Gu Suolai is in a mess.

270
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
He's going back.

271
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Then...

272
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,820
Wei Wuxian, you don't thank me first.

273
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Do you know that I've been with Master Jin for seven days,

274
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,820
almost every day, every night and every day?

275
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Seven days?

276
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Is that enough?

277
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
No.

278
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,820
The Gu Su and Qing He are all killed by Wen Shi.

279
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
We can only go to Lan Ling first.

280
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,820
This time, we should thank Master Jin.

281
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,820
If Master Jin didn't persuade Master Jin to come to save you,

282
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,820
we wouldn't have been able to bring him here.

283
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I don't have a sword.

284
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,820
If I go back to Yunmeng, it won't be seven days.

285
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
Oh, right.

286
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
I forgot that you can't meet them.

287
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Where's Wen Chao?

288
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Where's Wen Chao and them?

289
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
Didn't they stop you?

290
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,820
It's strange that Gu Suolai has been in a mess lately.

291
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
He sent Wen Chao and Wen Xu out.

292
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
They seem to be looking for something.

293
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,820
How else would we have been able to dig the hole so easily

294
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
and then save you all?

295
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
No matter what,

296
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
you saved us this time.

297
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
Thank you.

298
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Young Master Jiang,

299
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
since we've saved them,

300
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
we should leave now.

301
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Now, the Shi family and the Li army

302
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,820
are fighting against Wen Shi.

303
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
The disciples of all Shi families have left the country.

304
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,820
I wonder if they will pay attention to Wen Ruohan.

305
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
Although we're not in a hurry,

306
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,820
we have to defend Wen Shi's revenge.

307
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
Wei Wuxian and I will go back as soon as possible

308
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,820
and persuade Father to discuss the Wen Shi's plan with you.

309
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,820
Okay.

310
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
We'll take our leave now.

311
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
Take care, Young Master.

312
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,820
I didn't expect that Jin Zixuan

313
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
is so timid.

314
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
Let's go.

315
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Wei Wuxian, let's go.

316
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Second Young Master,

317
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
we just received a message from the guest.

318
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
He said that...

319
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
Hurry up.

320
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
He said that someone saw Young Master Jin Shi

321
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
and Young Master Jiang Zhi

322
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,820
taking a few people to the Moxi Mountain.

323
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
They?

324
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,820
What are they doing here?

325
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Are they here to save Wei Wuxian?

326
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
It's been so many days.

327
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,820
Let's add the king.

328
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
I'm afraid they're here to get Wei Wuxian's body.

329
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
You two,

330
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
go to the cave and see

331
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
if Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian are dead.

332
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Well...

333
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Why are you standing there?

334
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Hurry up!

335
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
Yes.

336
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Wen Zhuliu,

337
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,820
take Jiao Jiao to the Moxi Mountain

338
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
and see if they're alive.

339
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
If anything happens,

340
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
report to me.

341
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Yes.

342
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
Wei Wuxian,

343
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,820
even if you're lucky,

344
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,820
I won't let you

345
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
live comfortably.

346
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,820
I'm sorry.

347
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm sorry.

348
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,820
I'm sorry.

349
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Your Highness,

350
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,820
the one who is so soft and gentle

351
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
has passed away.

352
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
The one who is so gentle

353
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
is the one who is so gentle

354
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
and has no need to be punished

355
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
by the court.

356
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
That's great!

357
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,820
That's great!

358
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Master,

359
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
I'll learn archery from you in the future.

360
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Uncle Jiang,

361
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
I also want to set up a garden.

362
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
Cheng,

363
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
Xie.

364
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Master,

365
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Master,

366
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Master.

367
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Senior sister,

368
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
you're back.

369
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Xie.

370
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
Master,

371
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
Master,

372
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Master,

373
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Master,

374
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
Master,

375
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,820
Master,

376
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Master,

377
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Master,

378
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,820
Master,

379
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Master,

380
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
You're awake.

381
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Senior sister.

382
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
Okay,

383
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Don't rush.

384
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,540
Sister, you cook the soup.

385
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,540
I'll get it for you.

386
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Here.

387
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
Here.

388
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
Lotus root soup.

389
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
It's delicious.

390
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,620
Sister, the lotus root soup you made

391
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,020
is the best lotus root soup in the world.

392
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
You don't know that

393
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,980
when I was hungry

394
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,220
in Xuanwu Cave,

395
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,540
I was so brainless

396
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,620
that I made the lotus root soup.

397
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,140
Don't worry.

398
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
Drink slowly.

399
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,340
There's more in the pot.

400
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
It's delicious.

401
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
A-Xian.

402
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
How is it?

403
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Is it better?

404
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
Don't come down.

405
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
I'm fine.

406
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,220
Uncle Zhang, I'm much better.

407
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
If I were you, I'd be so sorry.

408
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
You're not good at it?

409
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,380
My hand is too heavy.

410
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
I can't lift it.

411
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,180
I'll make you something delicious.

412
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Thanks.

413
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
A-Xian.

414
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,620
You must be suffering this time.

415
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,340
Uncle Zhang, I'm actually fine.

416
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,540
I just stayed in the cave for a few days.

417
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,420
But Jiang Cheng had a hard time.

418
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,060
He asked me out for a few days.

419
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,220
You're not feeling well.

420
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
I'm fine.

421
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,220
I'm fine.

422
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
I'm fine.

423
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
I'm fine.

424
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
It's not bad.

425
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
Congratulations.

426
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
What congratulations?

427
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
You're not here.

428
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
If you were here,

429
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,620
you would be the first one.

430
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,620
You're so terrible.

431
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,220
You should have been the first one.

432
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,420
You shouldn't have been a hero.

433
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,620
You shouldn't have done this.

434
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,620
If you hadn't...

435
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Jiang Cheng.

436
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,220
Do you know what you said?

437
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I know.

438
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
Uncle Zhang, it's okay.

439
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
He just said it casually.

440
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,420
He just said it casually.

441
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
Cheng.

442
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
There are some things

443
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,820
that can't be said without reason.

444
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
He said it casually.

445
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
He said it casually.

446
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
You still don't understand

447
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,220
my family background.

448
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,020
You still don't...

449
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,820
Uncle Zhang.

450
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,620
He doesn't understand what's going on.

451
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,820
Wei Ying understands enough.

452
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,620
You know it's not right.

453
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,420
You're not like him.

454
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,420
You know what trouble

455
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,620
he will bring home.

456
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,820
You still want to make trouble?

457
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,820
Why are you here?

458
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
You're ridiculous.

459
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,420
I'm going to be asked like this.

460
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,420
Master Jiang.

461
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,220
Do you remember?

462
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
I'm also the owner of the Lotus House.

463
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,420
Do you remember?

464
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,220
Every land here

465
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,620
is my land.

466
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
Do you remember?

467
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,420
Which one is sitting and standing?

468
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,420
Your son.

469
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,620
Of course I remember.

470
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,420
You do remember.

471
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
But it's useless

472
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
to remember.

473
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,020
Wei Ying is so mean.

474
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
She's so mean.

475
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,420
She's so mean.

476
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
If she knew,

477
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,220
she should have stayed at the Lotus House

478
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,220
and allowed herself to go out.

479
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
That Wen Chao

480
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
really dared to

481
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,820
take two young men

482
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,620
from Gu Su, Lan Shi and Lan Ling.

483
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,620
What would happen?

484
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,020
Even if she dared to do so,

485
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,820
they were also unlucky.

486
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,020
Let her find you to be a hero.

487
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,820
I'll put the words here today.

488
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,620
You wait and see.

489
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,220
She will be in trouble

490
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,020
one day.

491
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
Enough.

492
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,420
Let's go back and talk.

493
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
What?

494
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Where to?

495
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,020
I'm not going to talk here.

496
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,020
I'm not guilty.

497
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,020
Jia Cheng, come here.

498
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Chief Jiang,

499
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,820
I have to say something.

500
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,620
You should know it clearly.

501
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,620
This is your own son,

502
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,420
the future master of the Lotus House.

503
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,420
Even if you're

504
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,620
a son of mine,

505
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
and you don't like him,

506
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,620
he's still Jiang.

507
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
I don't believe you.

508
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,020
I don't know what those people

509
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
out there said.

510
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,620
They said that Chief Jiang

511
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,260
has been

512
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,420
heartless and ungrateful

513
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,620
for so many years.

514
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,620
He's the son of an old man.

515
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,220
And even said

516
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,620
Wei Ying

517
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,620
would be your...

518
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,620
Yu Ziyuan!

519
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,220
Jiang Fengming,

520
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,620
do you think

521
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
your business is going to be good?

522
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,620
I don't know you.

523
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,620
Stop there.

524
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
I'm not done yet.

525
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
I'm sorry.

526
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
Chief Jiang.

527
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Stop!

528
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Jiang Cheng.

529
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,300
It's here.

530
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,420
Jiang Cheng.

531
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,580
Jiang Cheng!

532
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,540
You didn't say anything.

533
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,420
Why did you hit me?

534
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,940
Get back to bed!

535
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,980
You're lying down!

536
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,100
That's not the way.

537
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,700
Don't listen to the nonsense nonsense.

538
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,700
What nonsense nonsense?

539
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,460
Those nonsense are all in my mouth.

540
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Wait.

541
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,260
In short, I am a good person.

542
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,220
I can't see those people who are scaring me.

543
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Listen to me.

544
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,180
Let's talk it over.

545
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,020
Don't be so sad.

546
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,940
You are Uncle Jiang's own son.

547
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,540
The future family's master.

548
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,820
So Uncle Jiang is strict with you.

549
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,140
I am different.

550
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,020
I am someone else's son.

551
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,660
My parents are Uncle Jiang's good friends.

552
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,660
So he is kind to me.

553
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,660
Do you understand?

554
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,180
He is not strict with me.

555
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,380
He just doesn't like me.

556
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,580
How can I not like my own son?

557
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,220
Don't think about it.

558
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,820
I have seen those people who are scaring me.

559
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,420
They don't even know their parents.

560
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,300
That's right.

561
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,580
He doesn't like my mother.

562
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,860
He doesn't like me.

563
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
I know.

564
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,380
I am not the kind of person he likes.

565
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,100
I am not the kind of person he wants to be.

566
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,380
He thinks I don't know the family's family.

567
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,020
He doesn't have any family's share.

568
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,820
Yes.

569
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,900
You and Lan Wangji have a good relationship.

570
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,620
You have a good relationship.

571
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,980
But what about me?

572
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,380
I have been through a lot.

573
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
I am very energetic.

574
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,060
I haven't had a break for a moment.

575
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,460
What is the family's share?

576
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,300
Let me tell you.

577
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,900
If you have a family, you must respect it.

578
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,220
There are more than 3,000 family shares in the Guzulan family.

579
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,100
If everyone has a share,

580
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,460
will they live well?

581
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,100
Besides,

582
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,700
if anyone says they are the family's owner,

583
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,020
they must be followed by the family.

584
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,300
I don't believe that

585
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
we have so many family members in Yunmeng.

586
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,700
Everyone is the same.

587
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,260
Besides,

588
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,740
the Guzulan family

589
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,180
has never been in the Guzulan family.

590
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,500
But who dares to deny his strength and status?

591
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,820
The family's reputation is in vain.

592
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,900
Who dares to defame him?

593
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,740
Who dares to defame his murder?

594
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,780
So,

595
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,100
don't think about it.

596
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,380
When you become the family's owner,

597
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,380
I will be your subordinate.

598
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,340
Just like your father and my father.

599
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,100
There are two coins in the Guzulan family.

600
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,620
Yunmeng has two coins.

601
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,060
So,

602
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,020
no one can say that to you.

603
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,940
Do you know that?

604
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,660
You can't do it yourself.

605
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,500
Who dares to say that I am the one to do it?

606
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,100
Do you know that?

607
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,060
Just like you are now,

608
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,140
who can do it?

609
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Jiang Chengni.

610
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,580
Why did you become a hero

611
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,860
when you are in pain now?

612
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,780
I should have.

613
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,780
I should have a memory.

614
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,060
Am I a hero?

615
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,580
I can't be a hero.

616
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,860
Jiang Chengni.

617
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
Do you think we will meet them?

618
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,620
How would I know?
