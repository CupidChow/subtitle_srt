1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 17

3
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,920
The liquor of Yunmeng

4
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
is not as good as ours in Qishan.

5
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,320
It tastes strange.

6
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
That's true. It really does.

7
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Like the smell of the lake.

8
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,480
They are talking about Hefeng Liquor.

9
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,480
Hefeng liquor mixes the aroma of lotus and liquor,

10
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,080
and has the clarity of water.

11
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,640
Xian, don't drink too much.

12
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
In case you fall down there.

13
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,440
Leave him be, sis.

14
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I hope he fall down.

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
Senior sister,

16
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,000
would it be extraordinarily tasty

17
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,320
if we brew liquor

18
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,320
with lotus seeds and leaves?

19
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Stop your meaningless thoughts, Wei Wuxian.

20
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,680
Come and give me a hand.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
It's not meaningless.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
I've come up with its name.

23
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
I'll call it

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Hefeng Liquor.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,760
Graceful, isn't it?

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,680
Childe Wei.

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,600
Childe Wei.

28
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,800
Childe Wei.

29
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,720
Jiang Cheng.

30
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,200
Where are the others?

31
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't worry, Childe Wei.

32
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,600
They are drugged by me.

33
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,880
They are safe for the moment.

34
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,880
Childe Jiang is just in a coma.

35
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,480
But he has broken several ribs,

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
and also been whipped.

37
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
Whip?

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,240
Wen Chao found Jiang clan's whip.

39
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,600
Childe Jiang should have other wounds.

40
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,880
Oh, right.

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,280
Childe Jiang's purple lightening.

42
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,320
I've brought it.

43
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
Thanks.

44
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,840
Don't say so, Childe Wei.

45
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,200
Clan Leader Jiang and Madam Jiang's bodies

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,920
have been carried outside by people I sent.

47
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,320
I'll deliver them to you later.

48
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,760
You'd better leave as soon as you can.

49
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
Go.

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,680
Go?

51
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,080
Jiang Cheng is severely wounded.

52
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
Where can we go?

53
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,360
Childe Wei.

54
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,160
If you trust me,

55
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
I can take you to somewhere to hide.

56
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,160
Childe Jiang badly needs medicine and rest now.

57
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
He can't stand a long journey.

58
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,400
Where?

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Yiling.

60
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Go to my sister's.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,680
She can treat him.

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,360
Thank you, Wen Ning.

63
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
Second Childe, Second Childe.

64
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,560
Wake up.

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,080
Wake up.

66
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
What's going on?

67
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,560
The liquor was drugged.

68
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,200
By who?

69
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,120
Who dares?

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Don't waste your breath.

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
It's the Hundred Days Ebriety.

72
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,680
People who take it would have splitting headache

73
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,640
and muscle weakness.

74
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
It will take several days to recover.

75
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,560
It must be that asshole, Wei Wuxian.

76
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,400
By the way,

77
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,440
go check if Jiang Cheng is still there.

78
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
I checked.

79
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,680
Jiang Cheng was rescued.

80
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,880
What?

81
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
I set overwhelming traps around Lotus Cove.

82
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
Should be inaccessible even for a fly.

83
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,080
How did he make it?

84
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,160
Should he have the ability of flying or submerging in ground?

85
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Wake them useless trash up.

86
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
I'll interrogate them one by one.

87
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,360
Cheng.

88
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,800
Cheng, what happened?

89
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,400
Cheng.

90
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
What happened?

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,960
- Lady Jiang. - Cheng.

92
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Childe Jiang is just in a coma.

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
Let's treat him.

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,760
You...

95
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,800
Don't worry, Lady Jiang.

96
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,240
Childe Wei once saved me.

97
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,800
I won't turn my back against him.

98
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Xian. Li.

99
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,550
You should get moving.

100
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,790
Don't delay it any longer.

101
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Xian, what are you doing?

102
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,480
Grandma,

103
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,360
you should also find a place to hide.

104
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,400
Don't stay here.

105
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,400
Clan Leader and Madam Jiang are both gone.

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
You are also leaving.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,080
What can a old lady do even if I stay?

108
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Grandma,

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
we'll come back.

110
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Second Childe, Second Childe.

111
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
Wen Ning's rank is higher than mine.

112
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,400
I can't stop him when he wanted to check there.

113
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,080
So it's my fault?

114
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
No, no.

115
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,080
It's my fault.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll punish myself.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
It's all my fault.

118
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
All my fault.

119
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
Cores Crusher.

120
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,840
Second Childe.

121
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Wen Ning is such a fearless guy.

122
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,880
Childe.

123
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,560
Wen Ning...

124
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,680
He should have messed your business

125
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,840
depending on Clan Leader's favour to Wen Qing?

126
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,000
Get off me.

127
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,880
If it was really Wen Ning's work,

128
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,160
it won't be a problem.

129
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,440
Wen Zhuliu will escort me

130
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
to Yiling tomorrow.

131
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,520
Wen Qing was sent to the Supervisory Office in Yiling.

132
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
Would Wen Ning go back after saving Jiang Cheng?

133
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,480
Wen Ning has no other option.

134
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,520
He was definitely

135
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,520
going to Wen Qing for help.

136
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
Childe.

137
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,280
What would you do

138
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,280
if you find out they really did it?

139
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,240
Kill them all.

140
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,920
Childe Wei, here we are.

141
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
Where are we?

142
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,080
Let's get in first.

143
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,320
There are too many eyes.

144
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,040
Xian.

145
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
Childe Wen is right.

146
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,040
Let's get in.

147
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Here, this way.

148
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,240
Wait.

149
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,840
Senior sister,

150
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
where is this place?

151
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
Here's Yiling.

152
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,560
I... I...

153
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,720
Xian.

154
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,320
What are you doing?

155
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,680
It's the Supervisory Office in Yiling?

156
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,600
Which unlucky family's place

157
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
did you take?

158
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,520
What do you want

159
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
bringing us here?

160
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
Childe Wei, listen to me.

161
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,160
It's the Supervisory Office

162
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,360
but also my sister's residence.

163
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,040
I have no intention to hurt you.

164
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,520
If I want to hurt you,

165
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,720
I would have turned you back

166
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,640
after getting into Lotus Cove that night.

167
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,080
Why would I bother to take you here?

168
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
Wen clan's people

169
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,120
are searching for survivors of all clans.

170
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,360
I can't make you run with me randomly.

171
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,160
It's safe here at least.

172
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,720
They won't search the inner rooms of the Supervisory Office.

173
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,800
Xian.

174
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,880
Childe Wen is right.

175
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,520
Stop being paranoid like this.

176
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,200
Sorry.

177
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,920
No,

178
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
it's alright, Childe Wei.

179
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Let's get in first.

180
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,160
When my sister come,

181
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,200
-Ning.  -we can...

182
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,720
Open the door!

183
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,840
Open the door!

184
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,880
Anyone inside?

185
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
Open the door now!

186
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,480
Where are the people inside?

187
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,280
What's going on? Open the door!

188
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,960
Open it!

189
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,400
Where are the people?

190
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,160
Open it!

191
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,880
Quickly! Open it!

192
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,800
Nothing.

193
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
My brother is back.

194
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
He is ill again.

195
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,840
You can step down.

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,040
Yes, my lady.

197
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,840
No.

198
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,480
No.

199
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,760
Sister.

200
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,880
Dad.

201
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,720
Mom.

202
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,000
Dad.

203
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,440
Childe Wei.

204
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,350
A while ago...

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
what happened in Mount Muxi...

206
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
It has passed.

207
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
No need to mention.

208
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,070
What about

209
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,040
Lotus Cove?

210
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll kill those who

211
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,280
are responsible.

212
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,680
I see.

213
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,560
What is it?

214
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,080
Are you going to kill me now?

215
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,160
I'll take a look at Jiang Cheng.

216
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,480
Three ribs are broken.

217
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,320
The wounds caused by whips are not healed yet,

218
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
but not a big issue.

219
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,840
It'll leave scars.

220
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,160
He lost some power,

221
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,040
which will take several days to recover.

222
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,760
How could this happen?

223
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,080
What's wrong?

224
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,600
What's wrong with him?

225
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Jiang Cheng.

226
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,360
You are awake.

227
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,320
Do you know who I am?

228
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,520
Can you hear me?

229
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,600
Jiang Cheng,

230
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
don't scare me.

231
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,200
Jiang Cheng.

232
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Jiang Cheng.

233
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,520
Say something.

234
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,560
Jiang Cheng.

235
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Say something to me.

236
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,920
Quit it.

237
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,680
I'll find a way to erase them.

238
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,000
OK, OK. You can hit me.

239
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,800
if you feel better that way.

240
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Did you feel it?

241
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,160
What?

242
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I mean,

243
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,120
I used all my spiritual power

244
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,560
to hit you just now.

245
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,600
I ask you,

246
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,560
did you feel it?

247
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,560
Then,

248
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
you hit me again.

249
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,160
Have another try.

250
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
No need.

251
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,840
It will be the same

252
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,640
no matter how many times I hit you.

253
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,360
Wei Wuxian.

254
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you know

255
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,480
why he is called Cores Crusher?

256
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,240
Because his hands can

257
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,280
crush your golden core.

258
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,160
It will dissipate your spiritual power

259
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,920
and stop it from making golden core again,

260
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,000
leaving you as a mediocre people forever.

261
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,240
Cores Crusher.

262
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,560
Cores Crusher.

263
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,440
I will never make golden core again.

264
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,360
Never again.

265
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
I'll be mediocre in the rest of my life.

266
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,560
I can never realize my dream of becoming the top.

267
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,760
Jiang Cheng.

268
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,320
Do you know ?

269
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,040
My parents' cores

270
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
were crushed by him.

271
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
They lost the power to resist,

272
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,720
and were murdered by him.

273
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,800
Did you know that?

274
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,080
Wen Zhuliu, Wen Zhuliu.

275
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,760
I'll revenge.

276
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,680
I'll revenge. I'll revenge.

277
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,400
Jiang Cheng.

278
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,440
But how can I revenge?

279
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
I  lost my golden core now.

280
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,560
And I can't make golden core in the future.

281
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,520
How can I revenge?

282
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,560
Wei Wuxian,

283
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,680
why did you save me?

284
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,040
It's useless to save me.

285
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,560
I can just live

286
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,320
to see Wen clan's ostentation.

287
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,120
And can do nothing about it.

288
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,520
Childe Jiang.

289
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,760
Let me lift you up.

290
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You go out!

291
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Get out!

292
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't need your mercy.

293
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,840
I don't want to see anyone from Wen clan.

294
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,280
I don't want to see you.

295
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,920
Get lost. Lost!

296
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,200
Get out! Now!

297
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,120
Get out!

298
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,560
Get out! Get out of my face!

299
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,920
Sis.

300
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,920
Two kinds of guiding drug are missing.

301
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
Wuwei Seed and Dengxin Grass.

302
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,200
Boil a new one.

303
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,560
Sister.

304
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
About Childe Jiang...

305
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,400
He won't get well.

306
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,600
What?

307
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,960
Sister.

308
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,440
Are we going to start a feud?

309
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,320
Sister.

310
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,280
Please save him.

311
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,200
There already is a feud.

312
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,560
Sister.

313
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,200
What should we do?

314
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
Ning, remember.

315
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,920
What Wen clan did

316
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,680
doesn't represent us.

317
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,000
We practice medicine for generations,

318
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,600
saving people only, never killing people.

319
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,280
Understand?

320
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
Send him away

321
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,720
when he gets better.

322
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,520
To where?

323
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,600
No matter where but here.

324
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,200
You have been to Yunmeng.

325
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,080
Wen Chao is not a fool.

326
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,200
He will search here soon.

327
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Sister.

328
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,640
Thanks.

329
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,320
I want to ask you for a favor.

330
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
What can I do?

331
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,000
I need medical books.

332
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,280
All medical books, including ancient versions.

333
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,920
All the books can be found.

334
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,840
Wei Wuxian.

335
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,240
You need rest.

336
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
I need medical books.

337
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,760
Eat something.

338
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,760
Your senior sister made them for you.

339
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,920
You have to eat to gain strength.

340
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,920
Jiang Cheng's shallow wounds are healing well.

341
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,240
Whip scars are also fading.

342
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,880
But he won't eat or sleep.

343
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
I needled him under your senior sister's request.

344
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,360
He is asleep now.

345
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,000
Go to see your senior sister.

346
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,840
She is worried about you.

347
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,440
Cheng.

348
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,920
You have to get well soon.

349
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,640
Dad said

350
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,440
that we disciples of Jiang

351
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,280
should endure great setbacks.

352
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,520
Don't give up.

353
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Xian and I will figure out a way.

354
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,160
Senior sister.

355
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,280
Xian.

356
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,040
Senior sister.

357
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,440
Senior sister, you haven't recovered completely.

358
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,840
Don't stay up.

359
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,440
Have some sleep.

360
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,000
Xian.

361
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,480
Come here.

362
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,320
Xian.

363
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,680
Xian.

364
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,600
You are tired.

365
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
No, I'm not.

366
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,960
I have to read more books.

367
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,640
There must be recordings about

368
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,440
how to make core again.

369
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,960
But the books are not enough here.

370
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,600
I wish we were at Cloud Recesses.

371
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,880
No.

372
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,600
Cloud Recesses is burnt.

373
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,200
The books were burnt.

374
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Who else can help me?

375
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,680
Lan Zhan.

376
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,600
Lan Zhan will help me, senior sister.

377
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,080
Xian, Xian.

378
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,120
Come.

379
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,760
Xian.

380
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,960
You are tired.

381
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,480
You have to take a rest.

382
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,120
I don't want you to collapse

383
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,560
when Cheng gets better.

384
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,800
Senior sister,

385
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,360
maybe it's all my fault.

386
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,520
What are you saying?

387
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,150
Maybe Madam Yu was right,

388
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,080
I am the one to blame.

389
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,760
Blame you for what?

390
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
The death of my parents?

391
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
The massacre of Jiang clan?

392
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,840
The loss of Cheng's golden core?

393
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,600
It has come to this situation.

394
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,960
Blaming won't help

395
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,760
or change anything.

396
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,160
Xian.

397
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,840
My parents are gone.

398
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,600
Cheng is ill.

399
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,800
We have to live on our own now.

400
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,440
You are my only family.

401
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,880
I can't lose you too.

402
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Or I will really be the only one in the world.

403
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,800
Senior sister.

404
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Xian.

405
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,440
You promised me.

406
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,680
We will go back to Lotus Cove.

407
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,200
Don't you remember?

408
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,600
Senior sister made the porridge for you.

409
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,920
You have to eat to gain strength.

410
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,120
I found a way to save Jiang Cheng.

411
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,280
Listen to me, Miss Wen.

412
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,120
No, you can't do that.

413
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,200
Please think it again.

414
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,720
It's the only way to save Jiang Cheng.

415
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Miss Wen, I'm serious.

416
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,640
Definitely no.

417
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,760
We have no other way if

418
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,360
we don't do this.

419
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,480
I can't do that.

420
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,600
You...

421
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,000
Sis,

422
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,320
what's wrong?

423
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Do you know

424
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,800
what it will cost you?

425
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,480
You!

426
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,000
You just have to do me this favor.

427
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,800
I'll finish the rest.

428
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,720
Sister.

429
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,240
If you are talking about Childe Jiang's wounds,

430
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,840
please save him.

431
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,720
I owe them once.

432
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,240
Wen Chao won't find out

433
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
if we send them away as soon as they are recovered.

434
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,800
You know Jiang Cheng.

435
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,360
He's a naturally ambitious person,

436
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,480
focusing too much on gain and loss.

437
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,080
The cultivation is his life.

438
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,040
If he can only be

439
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,880
a mediocre people,

440
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,920
the rest of his life will be ruined.

441
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,840
And what about you?

442
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Sis.

443
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,320
I can only assure you of fifty percent chance.

444
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Fifty percent is OK.

445
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,440
At least it's half chance to succeed.
