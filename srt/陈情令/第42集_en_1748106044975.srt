00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,900
Episode 1

2
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,540
Gu Su Nan Bang Du baldass of Trans noch is the most important.

3
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
It looks like

4
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,180
the message is just the message of the turn usted.

5
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,740
The legacy that above all, I got.

6
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,340
Such important?

7
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,540
Su Shi?

8
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,640
Lord Han Guangliang.

9
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,740
Ours.

10
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,880
Earlier you呀 you ran away from Hsiao.

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,080
But you've still been exposed to him.

12
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
He uses Qin, you use Qin too.

13
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,580
What right do you have to say that you're a lazy person?

14
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
You?

15
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,880
Which one do you think is wrong?

16
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,580
Forget it, Chief Su.

17
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,080
I don't have anything that I can't see inside, right?

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Since you've said that,

19
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,080
I'll just open it and show you.

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Why is Madam Jin here?

21
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
We all have things together.

22
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Su also comes in often to see them.

23
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,580
Second Brother, everyone,

24
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,080
I'm here just like this.

25
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,080
If you want to see anything, please give me a call.

26
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Since Jin Guangyao didn't turn around and kill her,

27
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,080
aren't you afraid of what Jin Su will say?

28
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Madam Jin.

29
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Madam.

30
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
It turns out that Young Master Mo

31
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,080
brought us into the secret room to meet Madam Jin.

32
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
A-Yao.

33
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
What is that?

34
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
This.

35
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
This is a rare item.

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
This dagger,

37
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
it kills countless people.

38
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
It's powerful and invincible.

39
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Look at this dagger's blade.

40
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
If you look closely, you'll find that the person inside is not yourself.

41
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Sometimes it's a man, sometimes it's a woman,

42
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
sometimes it's an old man.

43
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Every person's shadow is the spirit that is under the assassin's hands.

44
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
It's very strong.

45
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
So I added a chain to seal it.

46
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Is this Mo Fei's...

47
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Yes.

48
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
It's a warm item.

49
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Then it's a warm item.

50
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Madam Jin.

51
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Su!

52
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Su!

53
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Su!

54
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Su!

55
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Su!

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Su!

57
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Su, please, please.

58
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Su!

59
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Su!

60
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
A-Yao,

61
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
please, please.

62
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Brother.

63
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
What is going on?

64
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Why did A-Su suddenly kill herself?

65
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
A-Yao,

66
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,080
why did you suddenly gather in the palace and let me open the treasure chest?

67
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Did you tell me anything?

68
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
What's going on?

69
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,080
A while ago, I was in the palace with a lot of disciples.

70
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
I went out to hunt.

71
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,080
When I was in the Mo Family, I met a knife-cutter.

72
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,080
This knife-cutter killed me and I was very willing to kill him.

73
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I didn't dare to take it, so I came back to report to the palace.

74
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,080
I was very willing to take it, so I came back to report to the palace.

75
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
So I forgot to keep searching for this moment.

76
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Finally, I found the body of the knife-cutter in a place called Yicheng.

77
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,080
But the body was invisible and I couldn't change my identity.

78
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,080
But the knife-cutter appeared.

79
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
The shape was...

80
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,080
The shape of the knife-cutter.

81
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
The knife-cutter?

82
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Could it be the body of the knife-cutter?

83
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
How could it be?

84
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,080
The knife-cutter killed so many girls.

85
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
How could it be?

86
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,080
The body of the knife-cutter is invisible and the flesh of the knife-cutter.

87
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Doctor, what are you saying?

88
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,080
To us or to you in the rest?

89
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
But isn't it?

90
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,080
My main ^^

91
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Doctor Gui!

92
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
The death of the deceased...

93
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
The death of the deceased...

94
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Who did this to send this kind of heart-to-heart disease?

95
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I don't know.

96
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
When I arrived at the beginning of the investigation,

97
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
the clue broke.

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
The clue broke.

99
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
So...

100
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
You came to me?

101
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,080
You just made me open the treasure chest.

102
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,080
I was just suspecting that...

103
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,080
the big brother's head was here.

104
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm afraid...

105
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
I won't mention it anymore.

106
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,080
But the second brother and Han Guangjun...

107
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,080
How did they know that I had this treasure chest in my past life?

108
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,080
How did they find out that...

109
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,080
the big brother's head was here?

110
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
What should I do?

111
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,080
What should I do to see the escape of the Naming Bureau?

112
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
What should I do to reveal the secret?

113
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
What should I do to tell them that the death of the deceased...

114
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,080
is a matter of justice?

115
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Xuan Yu...

116
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Did you tell them this to my second brother?

117
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
What's the use of saying such a thing?

118
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Mo Xuan Yu,

119
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
you were not allowed to disturb the family because of your temperament.

120
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,080
You were expelled from the Jin family.

121
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
When you heard the news,

122
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,080
you didn't know where you entered Han Guangjun's eyes.

123
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
You were out of the house at any time.

124
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
You became a traitor.

125
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Why would the Han Guangjun who was a member of the Sula Yiya Town...

126
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,080
leave such a person with a temperament?

127
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
You really are a traitor.

128
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I won't mention the King of the Valley.

129
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,080
But please tell me the truth.

130
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Asun is a very famous person.

131
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Do you have any tricks in this?

132
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Stop it.

133
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,080
What you're trying to do should be your Han Guangjun.

134
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Lan Zhan, get out of the way.

135
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
How dare you!

136
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Yiling Clan?

137
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
You are Yiling Clan?

138
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
You...are really him?

139
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I don't know if Yiling Clan is back to normal.

140
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
The world is so bright.

141
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Is there really something wrong with me?

142
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Third Brother, what did you just call him?

143
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Isn't he Mo Xuan Yu?

144
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Ling, come here.

145
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Be careful, Lord.

146
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
He pulled out his sword.

147
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,080
He must be Yiling Clan's Wei Wuxian.

148
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Who could pull out this sword?

149
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Who is Yiling Clan's Wei Wuxian?

150
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Third Brother, Han Guangjun.

151
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Do you have any misunderstandings?

152
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
No, I don't.

153
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
He must be Yiling Clan's Wei Wuxian.

154
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,080
The easiest way is to kill him.

155
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Uncle, uncle.

156
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Uncle, when you were in Mount Dafa,

157
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
didn't you use your brain to pull him out?

158
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
He's fine.

159
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Didn't you say that if he was shot,

160
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,080
he would definitely be in the dark.

161
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,080
So he must be Wei Wuxian.

162
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Mount Dafa?

163
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
That's right.

164
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Ling, you are so thoughtful.

165
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,080
I also remember what happened in Mount Dafa.

166
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,080
The one who took care of General Gui Wen Ning.

167
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Isn't that him?

168
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Everyone knows that

169
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,080
when Yuan Xian Xuan Yu was still in the capital,

170
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,080
he saw a piece of Yiling Clan's manuscript.

171
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,080
This manuscript is a kind of evil tree.

172
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
It's a deep spell.

173
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,080
It's for all the spiritual masters to be able to repair the injured.

174
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,080
This spell

175
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,080
is to make you use the Purple Palace to pull out 100 threads.

176
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
You can't verify it.

177
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Yiling Clan?

178
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,080
When you jumped off the cliff and jumped into the night sky,

179
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,080
your copy was stolen by my Lan Ling Jin clan.

180
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
But it didn't take long.

181
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
He sealed the sword himself.

182
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
What's the sword?

183
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
I believe that I don't need to explain it.

184
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
This sword has a spirit.

185
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,080
He refused to let someone else use it.

186
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
So he sealed himself.

187
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Other than Yiling Clan's own person,

188
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,080
others can't pull it out.

189
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
The sword...

190
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,080
and this Mo Xuan Yu

191
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
sealed this 16-year-old sword

192
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
in front of you.

193
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Pull it out!

194
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Brother!

195
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Xintu, clear the way.

196
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Yes.

197
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Xintu, clear the way.

198
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
A'Li.

199
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,080
I didn't expect that he was the leader of Yiling Clan, Wei Wuxian.

200
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,080
He made a conclusion and cheated all of us.

201
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,080
It's not your fault that you treat the murderer as your friend.

202
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
You're still a little boy.

203
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Chase after them!

204
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Chase after them!

205
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Hold on!

206
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Hold on!

207
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Hold on!

208
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,080
A'Li, come over here.

209
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Yiling Clan.

210
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
At this time,

211
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,080
you still won't take your mask off.

212
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Yiling Clan is indeed Yiling Clan.

213
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
After 16 years of being back in the world,

214
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
we turned our game around.

215
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
It's not just Jinling.

216
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Even the Korean army has found your way.

217
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Yes, it's not a lie.

218
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
You're right.

225
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I knew he was Wei Ying.

226
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Lan Zhan.

227
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Lan Zhan, don't be like this.

228
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
I've already used up this situation.

229
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Let's talk about it first.

230
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
You said you were fooled by Yiling Clan.

231
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
No one dares to say anything about you.

232
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Wei Ying, do you remember

233
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,080
what you asked me at the Cloud Recesses?

234
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Lan Zhan.

235
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
But at that time,

236
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
did you really thank me?

237
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
It's really not bad

238
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
to see a black-eyed girl like that.

239
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
No matter how much she's been around,

240
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
she's always been around.

241
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
I don't want to see a black-eyed girl like that.

242
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Lan Zhan.

243
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Lan Zhan,

244
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
I have one last chance for you.

245
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You must think about it.

246
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
If I really get out of this door,

247
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
your reputation will be ruined.

248
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Do you want to fight?

249
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Fight.

250
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Fight!

251
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Fight!

252
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Let's go.

253
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Let's go.

254
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
You're Wei Ying?

255
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,080
You're really Wei Wu Xie?

256
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Jin Ling, I'll tell you about this later.

257
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
I'll tell you about it later.

258
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
What's wrong?

259
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
What's wrong?

260
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
How is it?

261
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
This kid.

262
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,080
How come he's the same as him?

263
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Let's go.

264
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
I'm sorry.

265
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
I'm sorry.

266
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm not Wei Ruohan.

268
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Wei Ying!

269
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
What are you laughing at?

270
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Nothing.

271
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
I just...

272
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
I need to get out of this.

273
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,080
When everyone was trying to get me out of this,

274
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,080
you were the only one who scolded me.

275
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
But now,

276
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
everyone's father is still here.

277
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,080
He's the only one who can't get out of this.

278
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
He's the only one who can't get out of this.

279
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Everyone who wants me to die

280
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,080
hates me and takes me away.

281
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,080
You're the only one who's standing by my side.

282
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
I'm sorry.

283
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm sorry.

285
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Dad.

286
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
How's father?

287
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,080
He's fine.

288
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:59,480
future.

289
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,080
So

290
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,180
這個是

291
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
How?

292
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
But now,

293
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,180
I know who the last enemy is.

294
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
As long as he dies,

295
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
this curse will be solved.

296
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
It's the Golden Palace.

297
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
No matter what,

298
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
I won't believe Mo Xuan Yu

299
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
because of the old lady Jin.

300
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
I'm afraid he knows

301
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
what's the secret of Jin Guang Yao.

302
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
He wants to tell me

303
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,180
that Jin Guang Yao is the one who killed her first.

304
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Why did he do that?

305
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
But I'm sure

306
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Mo Xuan Yu knows the secret of Jin.

307
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
He must be very determined.

308
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Mo Xuan Yu knows the secret of Jin.

309
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
He must be very determined.

310
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
He's the same person.

311
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,180
And this person

312
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
is only eight or nine years old.

313
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
He's the one who has been chasing after

314
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
the dead of the Chifeng Village.

315
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
It seems that this person

316
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
knows about the things that

317
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Jin Guang Yao has not seen.

318
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Do you think

319
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,180
this person is Jin Guang Yao's lover?

320
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
He's the one who loves to hurt.

321
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Your sword.

322
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,180
Thank you.

323
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Do you think

324
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,180
he really knows how to use his sword?

325
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,180
This is Jin's room.

326
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Yes.

327
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
You brought me back to Yu Shen Bu Zhi Chu.

328
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,180
What if your brother finds out?

329
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
I've found it.

330
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Sorry to trouble you, Lord Ze Wu.

331
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
I forgot to bring you back.

332
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Before the matter is settled,

333
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,180
please stay here for a while.

334
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
As long as I'm here,

335
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,180
they won't dare to go to Yu Shen Bu Zhi Chu.

336
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
Lord Ze Wu,

337
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
how dare you ask where is the body of Chifeng Village?

338
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
I've seen all the families

339
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
of the Chifeng Village.

340
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
Now, I'm in charge of the funeral.

341
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
I've sent people who can trust me

342
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
to visit them.

343
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Then Jin Guang Yao's reaction?

344
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Tian Yi has no father.

345
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,180
He said he would investigate the truth

346
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
and give an explanation.

347
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
But at the same time,

348
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
since Childe Wei is awake,

349
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
I forgot

350
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,180
if you need an explanation.

351
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Brother,

352
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
what do you want me to say?

353
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,180
Brother,

354
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Chifeng Village's head is indeed in Jin Guang Yao's hands.

355
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,180
You saw it yourself.

356
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
He saw it himself.

357
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
You saw it yourself?

358
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
He saw it himself.

359
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
You believe Childe Wei?

360
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
Yes.

361
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
Then what about Jin Guang Yao?

362
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
You can't believe it.

363
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Wang Ji,

364
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
how do you decide

365
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
whether you can trust him?

366
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
You believe Childe Wei,

367
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,180
but I also believe Jin Guang Yao.

368
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Is Brother's head in his hands?

369
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
We don't have any clear eyes.

370
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
We all have to

371
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
trust that person's

372
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
words and make decisions

373
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
based on our understanding of the other person.

374
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
You think Childe Wei is the one

375
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
who knows him,

376
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
so you believe him.

377
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
Likewise,

378
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
I also think I know

379
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Jin Guang Yao,

380
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
so I believe him.

381
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
You think you're right.

382
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Can't I just think

383
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
I'm right?

384
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
Chief Nan,

385
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
I'm sorry.

386
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Childe Wei, don't worry.

387
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Before the investigation,

388
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
I won't make a mistake.

389
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
I won't expose your actions.

390
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Otherwise, I won't let

391
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Wang Ji bring you back

392
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
and heal your wounds.

393
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
Thank you, Chief Nan.

394
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
I'm willing to give Wei a chance.

395
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
I'm sure you can see

396
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
some other things

397
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
after I've seen it.

398
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
I wonder if I can prove it.

399
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Childe Wei,

400
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
maybe you did see some things,

401
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
but you can't prove it.

402
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
You saw it

403
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
in the secret room

404
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
at the Golden Bell Tower.

405
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,180
That's not true.

406
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
Then I'll tell you

407
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
what I'm going to do.

408
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
I'll tell you

409
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
what I'm going to do.

410
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
That's not true.

411
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
I'll tell you

412
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
some other things.

413
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,180
Chi Feng's death

414
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
was because he was in the fire.

415
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
But Chief Nan,

416
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
don't you think

417
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
it's too coincidental?

418
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
The Daoism is a cause and effect.

419
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Have you ever thought

420
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
if there will be

421
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
any other cause

422
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
behind this?

423
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,180
What do you think

424
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
there is?

425
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
The Green Heart.

426
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
Childe Wei,

427
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
do you know

428
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I gave the Green Heart to

429
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
the Golden Bell?

430
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
Then please listen to it

431
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
carefully.

432
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
What's the strange

433
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
about this song?

434
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
The Green Heart.

435
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Is this song

436
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
the song

437
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,180
given to

438
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Chief Nan?

439
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Yes.

440
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
It's cold and easy to play.

441
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Is it

442
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
the song

443
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
that you want to learn?

444
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Yes.

445
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
Since this song is so hard to learn,

446
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
why did you choose

447
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
this song

448
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,180
instead of the other one?

449
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Because I told him

450
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
that the Green Heart is hard to learn

451
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
but it's easy to play.

452
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
This song is indeed a bit tricky.

453
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
Childe Wei,

454
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,180
you were just wrong.

455
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
I was wrong just now?

456
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
You were wrong.

457
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
Wrong?

458
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Is it?

459
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
Wei Ying?

460
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Yes.

461
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
It's wrong.

462
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
It's not me.

463
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
It's Golden Bell.

464
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
When we were in the palace,

465
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
it was true

466
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
that she was right.

467
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
I was wrong.

468
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
I was wrong.

469
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
I was wrong.

470
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
I was wrong.

471
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
I was wrong.

472
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
When we were in the palace,

473
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
she was right.

474
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
That's how it was.

475
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
I can guarantee that

476
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
I just repeated

477
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,180
the wrong thing

478
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
once again.

479
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
Did she learn the wrong thing?

480
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
It's impossible.

481
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
It's impossible.

482
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
The face of the emperor is smart and clever.

483
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
He's over-confident.

484
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
How could he remember the wrong thing?

485
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,180
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

486
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
I'll repeat it once more.

487
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Please listen to

488
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
the part

489
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
I just played wrong.

490
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Stop.

491
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,180
That's the part.

492
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
It's indeed the part.

493
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
But I don't think

494
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,180
there's a reason.

495
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
There is indeed a reason.

496
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,180
But it's not the part

497
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,180
that's clear.

498
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
I don't think

499
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
there's a reason.

500
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,180
I don't think

501
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
there's a reason.

502
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
I don't think so.

503
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Come with me.

504
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
Chief An,

505
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
can we find

506
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,180
Xuanli's garden?

507
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
No.

508
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Here.

509
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
This is good.

510
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
This is...

511
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Jin Shushi.

512
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
This box is all for Yipu.

513
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,180
What's the origin of this mess?

514
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
It's a winter-winter secret.

515
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
It's a piece of land

516
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
that's been lost

517
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
and has been scattered

518
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
around the sea.

519
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
It's a secret

520
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
that's been collected

521
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
and become a secret

522
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
for many years.

523
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
If we use it

524
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
to make a living

525
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
when we're talking about it,

526
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
it's useless to harm people.

527
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
If we use it to sell,

528
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
if we use it to make a living,

529
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
I'll be so angry

530
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
that I'll be so ashamed.

531
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
And the person with the highest power

532
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,180
can marry someone

533
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
within three thoughts.

534
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
It's him.

535
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
Chief An,

536
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
is there a song

537
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
in this mess?

538
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
It can make people feel

539
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,180
that the person's spirit is so strong

540
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
that it's so strong

541
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
that it's so angry

542
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,180
and so dirty.

543
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,180
I think so.

544
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
The person's life

545
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,180
within three thoughts.

546
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
It's so cruel.

547
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
He won't choose

548
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
to kill someone with the highest power.

549
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,180
But if he

550
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
uses this song

551
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
to make a clear choice

552
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
and help him

553
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
to settle down

554
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
for three months,

555
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
will this song

556
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
be like a drug

557
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,180
that can cure

558
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
the person's spirit?

559
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
The person's spirit

560
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
is so strong

561
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,180
that it's so dirty.

562
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,180
It's so cruel.

563
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
It's so cruel.

564
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
It's so cruel.

565
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,180
It's so cruel.

566
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,180
It's so cruel.

567
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
It's so cruel.

568
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,180
It's so cruel.

569
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,180
It's so cruel.

570
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,180
It's so cruel.

571
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,180
It's so cruel.

572
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,180
It's so cruel.

573
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180

The Pot creation

576
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,180
can't be proved.

577
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,180
So sun is falling

578
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,180
and moon is falling

579
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,000
the 질 Can bei

580
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,940

The world is full of light and sunshine

582

The life and death are all in vain

583

The young people are still young

584
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,180
Why do we still live in the future?

585
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:32,180
We are like the wind and waves in the wind

586
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,180
The world is full of light and sunshine

587
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,180
The world is full of light and sunshine
