00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 16

3
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,120
Dad.

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,400
Dad.

5
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,080
Dad.

6
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Loose it! Loosen it now!

7
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,600
Dad.

8
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,040
Xian, Cheng.

9
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
Kill her!

10
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
Go now!

11
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
Get her!

12
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,520
Tear her into pieces! Beat her to death!

13
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,120
Kill her. Now!

14
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,880
Do you hear me? Kill her!

15
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,400
Archer

16
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,880
shall grab the bow and pull the string to shoot,

17
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
Come over, you there!

18
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,080
I order you...

19
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
shall relax the shoulders and tighten the arm,

20
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,000
and shall wait for the right time.

21
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,600
It's the way not to miss even one arrow.

22
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,680
Master,

23
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
I still cannot shoot.

24
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
Trash!

25
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,000
Kill!

26
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,840
Kill all of them.

27
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
Milady!

28
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
We can't go this way.

29
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Backdoor.

30
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
Do you see my dad and mom?

31
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,520
They'll be OK.

32
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,840
Don't cry now.

33
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
Look how the tears stain your little face!

34
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,160
My face is stained,

35
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,280
so you don't want me.

36
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,240
How so?

37
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,680
I like you no matter what you look like.

38
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
I am so scared today! So scared!

39
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,120
I thought I could never see you again!

40
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
There. There.

41
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
It's all right.

42
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
Fortunately Wen Zhuliu has protected you.

43
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,000
This bitch Yu deserved it.

44
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,200
She relied on the influence of her family

45
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,680
to force that man to marry her.

46
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,320
But what's the use in marrying her

47
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,520
when the man didn't like her?

48
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,240
Having been coldly treated for dozens of years.

49
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,080
she was secretly laughed at by almost everyone.

50
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Though she never lowered her arrogant head down.

51
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
Is what happened to her retributive?

52
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
Is it?

53
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,680
I think this woman is kind of beautiful.

54
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,440
Why didn't Jiang Fengmian like her?

55
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
It goes without saying.

56
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,760
A women

57
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
boxes others' ears with a whip all day.

58
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
That was extremely uncivilized.

59
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,760
Jiang Fengmian marrying her

60
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,520
is really rotten luck.

61
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,360
That's right.

62
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Women,

63
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
should be like

64
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,720
my tender lovely obedient and sensible Jiaojiao,

65
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,480
loving me with whole heart.

66
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,120
If I don't love you with my whole heart,

67
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,320
who else do I?

68
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,720
This bitch Yu.

69
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
I wanted to stab her for a few more times just now.

70
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,840
Wen Zhuliu stopped me.

71
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
This person is already dead.

72
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,080
It's merely a corpse.

73
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
He is that Wen Zhuliu.

74
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,520
He just has a queer disposition.

75
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,560
"One can be killed but humiliated"?

76
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,240
He killed them all just now.

77
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,800
What did he mean by saying that?

78
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
That's right.

79
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,280
He is that hypocritical indeed.

80
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,720
Lotus Cove...

81
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
Change the name

82
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,280
and dismantle all the doors

83
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
with nine petals lotus.

84
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,160
Change it with the sun emblem of Wen Clan of Qishan.

85
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
Feng Mian!

86
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,760
Feng Mian.

87
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,280
Milady,

88
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
I...

89
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,440
No.

90
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,280
Jiang Cheng, where are you going?

91
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Don't go back.

92
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
Don't go back?

93
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,120
Listen to yourself.

94
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
You tell me not to go back?

95
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,400
My parent's bodies are still in Lotus Cove.

96
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,080
Where should I go if I don't go back?

97
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,480
What can you do if you go back?

98
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,880
They even killed uncle Jiang and madam Yu.

99
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,560
You'll die when you go back.

100
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,520
I don't care.

101
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,880
If you are afraid, go away then.

102
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,880
Don't get in my way.

103
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,080
Jiang Cheng,

104
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,920
Revenge is a dish best served cold..

105
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,240
It's not now!

106
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,680
If not now, when?

107
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I have already had enough of you.

108
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,080
Get lost!

109
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,480
Jiang Cheng.

110
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,280
Jiang Cheng.

111
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,600
Uncle Jiang and madam Yu said

112
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,280
they wanted me to take good care of you.

113
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,800
- You must stay safe! - Shut up!

114
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,080
Why? Why?

115
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
You tell me!

116
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
Why did you save those guys?

117
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,560
Are you happy now?

118
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
I've told you for so many times.

119
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't play a hero.

120
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,680
Now look, you are a hero now.

121
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,680
Are you happy now?

122
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Are you satisfied now?

123
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,320
If Lan Wangji and Jin Zixuan were about to die, just let them.

124
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,760
Why should we care about their lifes?

125
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
Just let them die.

126
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,160
Why did you stand up for them?

127
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,880
Now Yunmeng is destroyed.

128
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,120
My parents are gone.

129
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
You are happy, aren't you?

130
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,600
Why? Why?

131
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,120
I want my parents.

132
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,040
My parents

133
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,720
and my seniors and juniors.

134
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,800
Now nothing exists,

135
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,560
not even Lotus Cove.

136
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,200
Childe Wen,

137
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
all rooms have been searched.

138
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,320
There are over 2,400 treasures after counting,

139
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,320
which are being classified.

140
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,400
Great.

141
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,200
Great. Great. Great.

142
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,200
Now is the time

143
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,480
to celebrate.

144
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,320
I say, we hold a banquet here tonight.

145
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,840
Make the best of things.

146
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,000
Congratulations to Childe Wen for mastering Lotus Cove.

147
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,680
How can it be Lotus Cove?

148
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,640
Its name has been changed.

149
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,120
From now on, it is Yunmeng Supervisory Office.

150
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,280
Wen Zhuliu.

151
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,560
Yes.

152
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,080
Have you found Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian?

153
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,520
I haven't found them yet.

154
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,360
In no way shall you let them run away,

155
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,160
or it leads to endless trouble.

156
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
They can't go far.

157
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,720
Come with me to pursue them now.

158
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
Understood.

159
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,440
Clean it up here.

160
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,880
Yes.

161
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,040
Let's go.

162
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't you forget

163
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,600
now senior sister

164
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
is waiting alone for us to find her.

165
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,600
Senior sister.

166
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,360
How's it going?

167
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,760
Xian,

168
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
go ahead.

169
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
I don't believe.

170
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,800
I don't believe.

171
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,680
Xian.

172
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,840
Senior sister.

173
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You have a bad fever.

174
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I will go and buy some medicine.

175
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,880
Don't worry.

176
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,000
I assure you I will not run around.

177
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,920
Jiang Cheng,

178
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,000
senior sister has a bad fever.

179
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,560
I will go and buy senior sister some medicine.

180
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,480
Take care of senior sister.

181
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,720
You stay here

182
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,720
and don't ever leave, OK?

183
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,800
Search closely, everyone.

184
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,200
- Stay away. - Is there any refugee

185
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
from Lotus Cove?

186
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,080
Sir, five pancakes please.

187
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
I've got him! I've got him!

188
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,000
Here!

189
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,840
Go!

190
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,880
Not good!

191
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,440
Wen clan catches up with us this quickly?

192
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,160
I have to go back to the tavern.

193
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,840
Take them out of here.

194
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,080
Jiang Cheng.

195
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,640
Senior sister.

196
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,480
Senior sister.

197
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,720
Senior sister.

198
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,600
Xian.

199
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,600
Senior sister. Jiang Cheng is missing.

200
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,120
Did he tell you about where he went?

201
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,080
Cheng is missing?

202
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,680
-You all be quick. - Sir.

203
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,920
The childe came with me.

204
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,160
Have you seen where he was heading?

205
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,360
The childe came with you?

206
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,600
I saw him earlier.

207
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,280
Later there were too many guests.

208
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:51,880
I didn't pay attention.

209
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,080
He must have left.

210
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Left?

211
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
He left?

212
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,200
Where will Cheng go?

213
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,320
What do we do?

214
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,320
What do we do now?

215
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
He can't be returning to Lotus Cove.

216
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,120
We have to find him.

217
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,800
Please be safe, Cheng.

218
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,520
Please be safe, Cheng.

219
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Senior sister.

220
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
You can't go.

221
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,520
Listen to me.

222
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
You go to grandma Liu' s for a while,

223
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,320
OK?

224
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Don't go.

225
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,240
Wait for me here.

226
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,360
I promise you.

227
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,400
I will surely take Jiang Cheng...

228
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
I will surely take him back.

229
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,880
But,

230
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,560
please be safe, I beg you.

231
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,400
You promise me.

232
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,680
Sure.

233
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
I promise you.

234
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,560
I will be fine.

235
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,160
But you need to promise me

236
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,400
you must find Cheng.

237
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,800
You must bring him back.

238
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,760
Let's three go to Meishan together,

239
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,720
shall we?

240
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,560
Don't move.

241
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,400
or else I will twist your throat off.

242
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,150
Childe Wei.

243
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,560
It's me. It's me.

244
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,920
Don't play tricks.

245
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,150
I don't play tricks.

246
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,440
Look at my face.

247
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,360
Wen Ning,

248
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,230
did you participate in the massacre at Lotus Cove?

249
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,670
Tell me, did you?

250
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,000
You are so ungrateful!

251
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,520
I shouldn't have saved you to begin with.

252
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,320
Childe Wei, I didn't.

253
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
I came here on hearing the news.

254
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,240
I've just arrived.

255
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,960
I rushed here immediately I knew.

256
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,520
But,

257
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,960
I was still one step late.

258
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,080
Childe Wei, you are about to

259
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,680
find Childe Jiang.

260
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
What are you saying?

261
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
You saw Jiang Cheng?

262
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
He was caught by Wen Chao before long.

263
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,800
Is Jiang Cheng really inside?

264
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Jiang Cheng is inside.

265
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,840
I have to get in Lotus Cove .

266
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,600
Use Wen Ning as a hostage?

267
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,840
He is one of Wen Clan after all.

268
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,880
If I want to make sure nothing goes wrong,

269
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,440
I can only take him...

270
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,160
Childe Wei,

271
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,560
you come back to rescue Childe Jiang, don't you?

272
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,040
Of course.

273
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,960
I...

274
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,120
can help you rescue him.

275
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,360
You are willing to help?

276
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,720
I can help you to take him out now.

277
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,560
You can save him?

278
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,520
Yes.

279
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
My sister and I,

280
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,680
though are assigned to Yiling Supervisory Office,

281
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,160
we still have

282
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,920
a bunch of obedient disciples.

283
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Can you help me to take Jiang Cheng

284
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,240
as well as remains of uncle Jiang and madam Yu

285
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,400
out?

286
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,440
I will try my best.

287
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,760
Who is there?

288
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,040
Isn't this Childe Wen?

289
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,200
This wine is for Second Childe?

290
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,680
I'm checking it.

291
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,040
Why did you return from Yiling?

292
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,880
Have you met Second Childe?

293
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,160
I heard

294
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,680
Second Childe obliterated Jiang clan.

295
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,840
Therefore I came to see it.

296
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,360
You shall leave it alone.

297
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,280
I am going to see Second Childe.

298
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,520
Does he really consider himself as a childe?

299
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,360
It's comfortable.

300
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,840
Drink.

301
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Come drink with me too.

302
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,920
Don't... don't go.

303
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,000
Jiang clan will always be subject to our Wen clan.

304
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
Wen Zhuliu,

305
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,840
why don't you drink?

306
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,120
The destruction of Jiang clan of Yunmeng

307
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,000
is mainly accredited to you.

308
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,080
What?

309
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
Not drink?

310
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
Wen Zhuliu!

311
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,080
Good!

312
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,040
Good!

313
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,600
That's it.

314
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,960
Everyone, drink!

315
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Come, come, come.

316
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Jiaojiao, drink again.

317
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,360
Jiaojiao, I tell you

318
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,800
Today I am so happy.

319
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,960
What am I doing here?

320
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,720
Senior sister is still waiting for me.

321
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,360
I have to protect her.

322
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,160
But how about Jiang Cheng?

323
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,760
Did Wen Ning lie to me?

324
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,240
What if he lied to me?

325
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,320
Jiang Cheng is not here at all.

326
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,600
No.

327
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,160
It's the best if Jiang Cheng is not inside.
