The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000

The sixth one is the first one.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the first one.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why is there no machine gun?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who?

Well.

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,880
I won't kill him anymore.

41
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,960
Master Wen.

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,060
Good evening.

43
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,140
What 컳什么 he's got the metal on his body?

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,100
I have already lost him for the first time.

45
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:21,320
Once again, the

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,660
sounds of power aren't every moment again.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,600

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Master Wen, I have a magic spell.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
It's not called Yin-Tian.

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,720
It's called Yin-Hong-Zheng-Zhu.

62

We won!

76
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
That sun

77
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
finally came down.

78
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
The Sun

79
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Ming Jue Xiong

80
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Xi Chen

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
You finally woke up.

82
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
The Sun

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
Give me the knife.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
You, Chief.

85
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Listen to me.

86
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Ming Jue Xiong

87
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Chief Nie, you still have wounds.

88
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Xi Chen, don't be afraid.

89
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
When you killed my Nye family just now,

90
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I had no choice.

91
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
No choice?

92
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Whether I kill you or not,

93
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I'm here for you.

94
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Are you really here?

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Chief Nie,

96
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
if we are together, we won't...

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Ming Jue Xiong

98
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Xi Chen, get out of here!

99
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Qi Nu

100
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Chief

101
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Ming Jue Xiong

102
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Ming Jue Xiong

103
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Why are you so bitter?

104
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Why so bitter?

105
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
When he left Qing He,

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
why did I lose his message?

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
It was because of Wen Shi.

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
He was being cursed in the night.

109
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Wen Shi!

110
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Do you know who is the one who

111
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
showed you the map of the Mount Qi?

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Do you know who our intelligence

113
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
was?

114
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Don't doubt it.

115
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I also received the news from A Yao.

116
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
I forgot they arrived at Yan Yang Palace.

117
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
I didn't believe it.

118
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
It was he who set up the trap

119
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
to let Wen Ruohan go.

120
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
He killed Wen Ruohan in a flash.

121
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
He...

122
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Ming Jue Xiong,

123
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
after Qing He's death,

124
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
A Yao has always felt guilty to you.

125
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,120
She also didn't dare to give you a reward.

126
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
She knew I didn't know how to escape from Yun Sheng,

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
so she saved me.

128
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Later,

129
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
she tried to set up the trap,

130
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
entered the Mount Qi,

131
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
and entered Wen Ruohan.

132
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
She wrote to me secretly.

133
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I didn't know who Song Xingzhe was.

134
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Later, I saw the map of the mountain

135
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
and recognized her.

136
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Have you ever lost your mind?

137
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Zeng Wu Jun,

138
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
you saw it too.

139
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I said

140
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
the kind of thing

141
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
you did just now.

142
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
A Xie.

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
A Xie, you're awake.

144
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
How is it?

145
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Is there anything wrong?

146
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Sister,

147
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
what time is it now?

148
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
It's been three days.

149
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
A Xie.

150
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Three days?

151
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Where's Jiang Cheng?

152
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Where's Lan Zhan?

153
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Don't worry.

154
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
They're all safe.

155
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
A Xie,

156
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
it's been a while.

157
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
There's nothing to worry about.

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
What matters to you

159
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
is to have a good rest.

160
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
You'll be lost for the next few days.

161
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Cheng and Second Young Master

162
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
are worried about you.

163
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Even the Golden Clan Master

164
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
has come to see you for several times.

165
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Qin Guangshan.

166
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
When the Wen Clan is dead,

167
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
the Golden Clan Master

168
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
rushed over from Lan Ling

169
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
to say he wanted to lead the army

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
and pursue the Wen Clan.

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
The battle of the birthday is not going to end.

172
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
It's going to be a tough one.

173
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
A Xie,

174
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
you're not going to let anyone down.

175
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Yes, Sister.

176
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Don't get up in a hurry.

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Second Young Master said

181
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
you need to use the Fire Talisman

182
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
to get through the battle.

183
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Even if you wake up,

184
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
you need to rest for a few more days.

185
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Sister.

186
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
You know that too.

187
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I didn't expect

188
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
we're so good at this.

189
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
But,

190
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
we can't use the Fire Talisman

191
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
in any way.

192
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Second Young Master said

193
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
the Fire Talisman needs too much.

194
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
It's easy to lose your mind.

195
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Second Young Master.

196
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Today is always Second Young Master Lan.

197
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
He's so dull.

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
He doesn't have so much to say.

199
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
You're not serious.

200
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
You got married these days.

201
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Second Young Master

202
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
comes here every day to play the piano for you.

203
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
He's so clear-hearted.

204
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I'm afraid you won't wake up so soon.

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I think it's Second Young Master Lan.

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Second Young Master.

207
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Miss Jiang.

208
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Second Young Master.

209
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
This time,

210
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
I want to thank Second Young Master Lan.

211
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Only then will I wake up so soon.

212
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
You two talk first.

213
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I'll go take care of Shang Yuan.

214
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Second Young Master.

215
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Second Young Master.

216
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Lan Zhan, actually I...

217
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
I'd like you...

218
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
to do something about this.

219
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
I am very happy for you.

220
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Mister Lan Lan.

221
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Hello, stallor.

222
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
The delivery is ready.

223
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
He's back.

224
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
What did you say?

225
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,400
Let's...

226
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,460
Let's...

227
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,380
Lan Zhan, Illegally.

228
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,500
3 days.

229
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,320
3 days.

230
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,320
Woo I got better.

231
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,760
It's also very good to have body Adaptation.

232
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
A shoe?

233
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,880
I don't need a shoe.

234
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
I just need to be too much.

235
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,480
Wei Ying.

236
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,040
Lan Zhan,

237
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
do you also think that the soul talisman is a shoe

238
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,760
that interferes with people's mind?

239
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,880
However,

240
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,760
is there really such a thing

241
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,440
that is unknowingly unfeeling?

242
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
It can change people's mind.

243
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
From the middle to the end,

244
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,000
from the white to the black.

245
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,800
Kill!

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,720
Catch them!

247
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,640
I'll kill Wen Shi and Yu Ni.

248
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,920
Where are those three silver sticks?

249
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,680
They're gone.

250
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
Kill!

251
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,800
Clan Leader Lan.

252
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,360
With the help of Wen Shi and Yu Ni,

253
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,800
you don't need to trouble the Clan Leader.

254
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,800
Zi Xuan will handle it.

255
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,840
But I just heard a woman's voice.

256
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,440
If I take Wen Shi and Yu Ni,

257
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't need to catch these

258
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
unfeeling Wen Shi and Yu Ni.

259
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,960
Xichen.

260
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
I understand your concern.

261
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,040
But even though Wen Shi is the King,

262
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,120
the guest of Wen Shi's family

263
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,000
is countless.

264
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
He's not a single person.

265
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,800
We've been fighting for the night.

266
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
But if they don't prepare for us,

267
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,880
and fight again,

268
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
we'll be the witness

269
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
for the death of Wen Shi.

270
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,360
Clan Leader Lan, you're always on the lookout.

271
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
Xichen doesn't mean

272
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,360
what I said.

273
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,920
Clan Leader Jin.

274
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,880
If not,

275
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,440
we'd let these

276
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,360
unfeeling Wen Shi and Yu Ni.

277
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,760
hindsight you blocked the way,

278
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,360
I'll leave it to you.

279
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,040
Listen,

280
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Zou.

281
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,200
Mr. Zou,

282
00:19:43,200 --> 00:20:00,540
we made our move to Lei

283
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,420
but if it falls into the core of the hydrangeas

284
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,340
and the other cross- merciful people's hands

285
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,260
certainly not active

286
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,160
So to catch after the fish

287
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,180
is to revisit the cause and effect

288
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,220
of the出現

289
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,700
as Director in the forest

290
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,720
knows

291
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,380
Chiefpielt, for singing

292
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,820
it is useful

293
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,800
it is not useful

294
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,400
but it's a brilliant matter

295
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
It's important.

296
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
You can't let anyone

297
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
who is suspicious.

298
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
So,

299
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,000
no matter who is a military officer,

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
military officer, or a soldier,

301
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,800
you must ask him.

302
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,640
I've already told Ayao

303
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
to investigate this matter.

304
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,840
To be honest,

305
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
Ayao is my son who has been missing for many years.

306
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,440
Now, I have the chance

307
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,880
to recognize him.

308
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,080
Good luck.

309
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,680
Wanxing.

310
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
Change him

311
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,320
to a say bastard of Jin Guangyao.

312
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,760
Sorry for our Nothingness,

313
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,080
but we had to wait here

314
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
to expose Anju.

315
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,880
We need you to get him handpicked.

316
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,920
Ayao...

317
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,920
What do you think of the plague?

318
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I've interrogated all the people in the underground.

319
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
There's no cause for it.

320
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Moreover, most of them are plague-related.

321
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
They have no way to attack.

322
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I suggest we should keep these old men in custody.

323
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
As long as they don't break up.

324
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,920
And if we really have to do something about it,

325
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
we'll end up here.

326
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
But where should we keep them?

327
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
There's a place in the Wens.

328
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
It's called the Qiong Qi Road.

329
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
It's a valley in the valley.

330
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
It's very hidden.

331
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It's hard to find.

332
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Why don't we ask them to do it?

333
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
You're familiar with it.

334
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Then, let's do as Ayao said.

335
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Come back!

336
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Hurry up!

337
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Ayao,

338
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
you're BARO.

339
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Don't you know that Sh fluffy guy is En Yuabs burst out water because of Yang Yuabs?

340
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
He's afraid maybe you'll die?

341
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Evil is like a city.

342
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,920
Am I evil?

343
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
I... I didn't mean that.

344
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,160
Zewu Jun, don't blame me.

345
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,480
I've known Nie Zongzhu for so many years.

346
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,320
I know his feelings.

347
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
I've never put them in my heart.

348
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,960
Zewu Jun,

349
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
you can follow them first.

350
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,360
I'll handle this.

351
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Okay.

352
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Bring them in.

353
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Zewu Jun,

354
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
you can follow them first.

355
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I'll handle this.

356
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Lan Zhan,

357
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,800
these people are

358
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
so familiar with the blood

359
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
and the black and white.

360
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Wei Ying,

361
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm here.

362
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
You'd rather rest

363
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
than like the light.

364
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Lan Zhan,

365
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
you want me to rest and like it,

366
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
but you're also suspecting me.

367
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Where did you get the sound?

368
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
How could you control the sound?

369
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,920
What could you control the sound?

370
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
It's the blood.

371
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
What the hell is it?

372
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
When did you practice the sound?

373
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Lan Zhan,

374
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
if I was in the hole of the path,

375
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
I'd get a sound.

376
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Do you believe me?

377
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
When?

378
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
When the path was chosen.

379
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
When did you practice the sound?

380
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
You knew it was the sound.

381
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Why did you want to practice the sound?

382
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Lan Zhan, enough.

383
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,920
You promised to let me help you.

384
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,920
But if you don't believe me,

385
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
what should I do?

386
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
The Tiger Manor is not a hole.

387
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Once you're in the deep of your heart,

388
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
you can't control it.

389
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You can't control it.

390
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Once you're in the deep of your heart,

391
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
you can't control it.

392
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Lan Zhan,

393
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
you're worried that I'll be controlled by the seal

394
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
like Wen Ruohan.

395
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
But the Tiger Manor is not a seal.

396
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm not Wen Ruohan.

397
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Help!

398
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I didn't know that

399
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
you're Mr. Lan'er.

400
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
I didn't know

401
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
why Mr. Lan'er

402
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
is taking care of these

403
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
evil things.

404
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
These are all old and weak.

405
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
It's a matter of evil things.

406
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
The Sect Leader has a command.

407
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Those who are related to the seal

408
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
can't leave any of them.

409
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
The Sect Leader Nie and the Sect Leader Lan

410
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
have agreed.

411
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Could it be that

412
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
you're the people

413
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
who are involved in the matter?

414
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
I'm afraid that

415
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
the mountains are going to fall again.

416
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm afraid what I really need

417
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
is the peace of the world.

418
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:42,920
The

419
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Sect Leader

420
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
is

421
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
the one who

422
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
is the one who

423
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
is the one who

424
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
is the one who

00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
is the one who

426
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
is the one who

00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
is the one who

428
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
is the one who

429
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
is the one who is the one who

445
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,980
opened

446
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:27,280
both

447
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,420
For Gods please stop sir.

448
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,560
The pat Влад remained in front of you.

449
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:23,320
Today the three of us attacked the temple of revision and came out with no regret.

450
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,180
like hairùa little swan

451
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,480
the rápido world

452
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,220

455
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,460
as I believe

456
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,880
the ordering would be

457
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,560

458
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320

Master Jing.

461
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,960
Master Yao.

462
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,960
Congratulation.

463
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,640
Our ceremony is finally over.

464
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,600
Don't

465
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240

466
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,960
Master Yao, you are too kind.

467
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,240
Thank you for the Adventures you have in才.

468
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,960
Master Jing.

469
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,120
Not now.

470
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,040
Exactly the respect you gave me

471
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,960
This is Senior Preceptor Bo is too humble.

472
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:31,160
Not long ago, you were very

473
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,840
busy with work.

474
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,800
Who did you estoyids like?

475
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,280
You spit out your nose?

476
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Who?

477
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,000
This night,

478
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,540
Chef Jiang, customer,

479
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,540
in ourще difficult day for ever,

480
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,880
you have chinny face.

481
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,460
I'm sorry.

482
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,320
When can we accept and respect the Simple Leader's qin?

483
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,500
gapsen in me,

484
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,020
however,

485
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
the need is in your heart.

486
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,360
Not necessary an computers.

487
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,020
I agree.

488
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,360
Fengming and I are She�린

489
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,700
are in the same team.

490
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
I didn't expect that

491
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
we would be together.

492
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Lord Zhou Wujun, Lord Han Guang is here.

493
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Come.

494
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Congratulations, Lord Jiang.

495
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
I believe that if you lead us,

496
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
the lotus tree will be in the valley of Chongzhen

497
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
and will protect the dream and the peace.

498
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Lord Lan, please lead us.

499
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Lord Chi Feng is here.

500
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Lord Jin.

501
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
Lord Li.

502
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Why do you come here?

503
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,700
The people are waiting for you to start the ceremony.

504
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Lord Chi Feng, please come in.

505
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Aya, you forgot.

506
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Since you have defeated me,

507
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
you should call me brother.

508
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Yes.

509
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Thank you for reminding me.

510
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Brother.

511
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Please.

512
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Lord Jin, what do you mean?

513
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Lord Li, please come in.

514
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Lord Jin,

515
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
everyone,

516
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
we are not a party,

517
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,700
but we will never be in the position.

518
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
Lord Nie, you are really

519
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
a great man.

520
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
I am not good at this.

521
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
We will practice again.

522
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Lord Nie, please come in.

523
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Please.

524
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
Childe Wei.

525
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Childe Wei,

526
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
what did you want to say to me?

527
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Me?

528
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Yes.

529
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
When we were building the ceremony,

530
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
Childe Wei said something to me.

531
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,700
This person is really a great man.

532
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
He is not in any trouble.

533
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,700
It was the day of the ceremony.

534
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Lord Lianfeng was in a gentle position.

535
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
He was very gentle.

536
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
He was very gentle.

537
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
He was very gentle.

538
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
He was very gentle.

539
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,700
Why didn't you see him today?

540
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,700
Childe Wei,

541
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
you are so filial.

542
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
I just took a bottle of soft drink with me.

543
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Then I found out that it was not too late.

544
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
I was in a hurry.

545
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
I see.

546
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Please.

547
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Please.

548
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
Lord Lianfeng.

549
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Lord Lianfeng,

550
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
please come to the house of Lord Jiang.

551
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
Please.

552
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,700
Please write down the name of the person who saved my mother.

553
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
Please.

554
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
Lord Lianfeng.

555
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,700
Lan Zhan, it's you.

556
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
How is it?

557
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Do you want to play a play?

558
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
I am playing the new progress.

559
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,700
You haven't given up yet?

560
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
You are really a man.

561
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
You are so stubborn.

562
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
All right, Lord Lianfeng.

563
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:37,260
The hundred

564
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,700
I will leave first.

565
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Everyone, please have a seat.

566
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Everyone, I have always been worried about something.

567
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Before, because of the war, I was not in a hurry.

568
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Now, the situation is chaotic.

569
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I have no more worries.

570
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
Today, you are all here.

571
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,700
I also want to ask you to make a witness.

572
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Everyone knows that I and Jiang Fengmian, the head of the Jiang Clan, are in the same family.

573
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,700
Mrs. Yu and Jin Mo are also sisters.

574
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:49,700
I, Zi Xuan, have made a engagement with Miss Jiang since childhood.

575
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
It's just a misunderstanding.

576
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
It's a pity.

577
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Now, I am going first.

578
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,700
I hope that I can be close to Miss Jiang.

579
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
First, I will do my best to serve as the head of the family.

580
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,700
Second, I will also be the daughter of the head of the family.

581
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,700
I am willing to do it.

582
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,700
How about you, Miss Jiang?

583
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Miss Jiang, this is a good thing.

584
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
You agreed?

585
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Yes.

586
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
You are right.

587
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
You agreed, Miss Jiang.

588
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,700
The flower-picking blood is not the same as the one in the past.

589
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,700
But this marriage has long been done.

590
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,700
Today, it is not allowed to make people think that I am a traitor.

591
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

592
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

593
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

594
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

595
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

596
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

597
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

598
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

599
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

600
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

601
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

602
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
The beauty of the new chief, we are in the heart.

603
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,700
How completely do I feel about what I lost when I was in the previous life?

604
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,700
As always...

605
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I don't want to confuse them

606
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
No matter these hardships

607
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
I don't regret
