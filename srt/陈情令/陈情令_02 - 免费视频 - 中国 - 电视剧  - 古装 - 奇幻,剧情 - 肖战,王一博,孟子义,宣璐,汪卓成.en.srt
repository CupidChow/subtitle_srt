1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 02

3
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Donkey as you are,

4
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,120
eat only fresh grass with dew

5
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,440
but any brown-tipped grass.

6
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,480
Once unsatisfied,

7
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
you'd get angry and stop moving.

8
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,640
And you'd even kick your feet.

9
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,480
Well, Well, Well...

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
You are my master now.

11
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
OK? My good master, go go go.

12
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,640
My good master,

13
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,680
what are you doing?

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
How far is it?

15
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,480
No idea.

16
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
I suppose it won't be far.

17
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,760
It's scorching.

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,680
So hot.

19
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,040
I'm thirsty.

20
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
We've been walking for so long.

21
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,480
When can we have a rest?

22
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,320
How far is it?

23
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,560
There's a well.

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
Come, let's get some water.

25
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,320
I want water, too.

26
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,760
I'll go.

27
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,320
Here.

28
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,080
Yan!

29
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,720
So weird.

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
Why the pointer doesn't move at all

31
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
when we are getting closer to the Dafan Mountain?

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,000
Maybe your compass is broken.

33
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Find a new one next time.

34
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,920
There's only about 10 miles away from the Dafan Mountain.

35
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,440
We can't rest for too long.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,920
We won't be the most meritorious

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,360
if others should arrive before us.

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,200
Hi, friends

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,720
Is there anything unusual

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
in Dafan Mountain lately?

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,080
You probably didn't know that

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,440
The Dafan Mountain was once a blessed place with spiritual spring

43
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,080
but it declined gradually for unknown reason.

44
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,160
Recently it is said there appear soul-eaters,

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,920
which had taken several souls.

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,560
No.

47
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
I don't think so.

48
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm afraid that

49
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,510
there aren't any monsters.

50
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,640
See?

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
All the pointers which indicate monsters are steady.

52
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
If you are right,

53
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,680
how comes there are soulless symptoms?

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,480
Maybe

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,800
your compass is to blame.

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,800
Impossible.

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
Don't you know who made my compass?

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,520
What do you mean?

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,760
Of course I know.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
It was made by Wei Wuxian.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,560
His crafts are not all perfect.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,680
Is his stuff unquestionable?

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
I didn't say that.

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
I never said his crafts are all perfect.

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,040
How can you slander me?

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Anyway, Wei's craft is unqualified!

67
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,640
But it's been with me for years.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
it never went wrong.

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,680
Why do you trust him so sincerely?

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Is Wei your dad?

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,480
He is my idol!

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,840
Let's go.

73
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Good master,

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,360
time to go!

75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,320
Here you are.

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,860
= Yan =

77
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,280
Yan!

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,840
Excuse us.

79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,720
Thanks.

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
Want an apple?

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,680
No way! Now you can go?

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
Apple! Apple!

83
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,640
Apple!

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,800
Do you hear that?

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,280
Do you?

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
I'll call you Apple from now on.

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Let's go!

88
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,120
Yan

89
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,960
Yan!

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,000
Lady.

91
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,120
Yan!

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,360
Yan!

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,040
I beg you. Stop the dance!

94
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Yan!

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,360
Yan!

96
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,720
Yan!

97
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
My Yan!

98
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,800
Madam,

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
what's wrong with her?

100
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,880
She is my daughter.

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
Not long ago,

102
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,000
she was engaged.

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
But her fiance didn't live long.

104
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
One day,

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,800
he went to cut firewood in the mountain.

106
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Yan insisted on finding him.

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,200
But unexpectedly,

108
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
when she came back

109
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,400
- Yan.

110
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
seems like a different person.

111
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,240
Yan.

112
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Neither eat nor drink.

113
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,160
Yan.

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,600
And doesn't remember us.

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,360
Yan.

116
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Yan.

117
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,880
Sometimes she can recognize people,

118
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,120
but she is out of her mind since then.

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,520
She often dances towards Dafan Mountain.

120
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,280
What sin did our family commit to deserve this?

121
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
When Yan just got a little better,

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,960
her dad lost his soul

123
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,800
and died soon after that.

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
Help!

125
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,840
Anyone?

126
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,910
Help!

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,400
Somebody help!

128
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Can anyone help me?

129
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,240
Help!

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,840
Help!

131
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,920
Help!

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,800
Help!

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
Help!

134
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,640
Is anyone here?

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Help!

136
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,400
Help!

137
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
Help!

138
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,020
= Jin Ling, courtesy name is Rulan =

139
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,160
Always you idiots!

140
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
There are over 400 Denity-biding Nets in the mountain,

141
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
yet to catch any preys,

142
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,240
but being damaged by you guys first.

143
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,360
One piece of Denity-biding Net is quiet expensive,

144
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,840
he should have set over 400 pieces.

145
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,360
Very typical of Jin clan of Lanling.

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,560
Childe Jin, please make a merciful exception.

147
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,760
Put us down, please.

148
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,320
Please, please.

149
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Put us down, please.

150
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,400
You fools.

151
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,520
It's better to keep you that way

152
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,920
lest you wander around

153
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,080
to mess my business.

154
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
Put us down please, Childe Jin.

155
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
If I should catch the soul-eaters

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,720
and still remember you,

157
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
then I'll put you down.

158
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,320
Childe Jin!

159
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,160
Put us down please.

160
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
Please Childe Jin, put us down.

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,720
Apple!

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,520
Apple!

163
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,880
Apple!

164
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
Apple!

165
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,600
Apple!

166
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,760
Help!

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Apple!

168
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
Let us down!

169
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,680
It's you!

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,480
What?

171
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,760
You know me?

172
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
You've gone crazy after being expelled to home?

173
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,920
Look at how badly off you are now.

174
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,040
My uncle was wise to have driven you away

175
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,600
at that time.

176
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,440
How dare Mo clan still

177
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
let you make appearance.

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
I didn't know that

179
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,520
Mo Xuanyu is really the love child of Clan Leader Jin.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,920
Get out of my sight!

181
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,560
You make me disgusted.

182
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Lewd thief!

183
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Who are you referring to?

184
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
I said you!

185
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,960
Get lost now!

186
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,640
I can see you lack in some maternal education.

187
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,600
You!

188
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,880
What did you say?!

189
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,160
You!

190
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,480
Your spiritual power was too scarce to cultivate.

191
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
Now adopt such crooked tricks!

192
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,040
You'd better watch out.

193
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Do you know who is coming today?

194
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Oh, I'm so afraid.

195
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,440
I'll tell my uncle if you don't lift the trick.

196
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
You are dead then!

197
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,840
Why your uncle but your dad?

198
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
Who is your uncle?

199
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,640
His uncle is me.

200
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Any last words?

201
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Uncle.

202
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,840
= Jiang Cheng, courtesy name is Wanyin =

203
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,480
Uncle.

204
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Uncle.

205
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,640
Stop!

206
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,680
Jin Ling,

207
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,120
what took you so long?

208
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,120
Are you waiting for me to help you up?

209
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
Look how embarrassing you are.

210
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,880
Stand up!

211
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,040
I'll break your legs!

212
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,240
Breaking his legs?

213
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Have I told you

214
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,680
anyone who use Yiling Patriarch's tricks

215
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,880
should be killed

216
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
and fed your dog.

217
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm so out of luck today.

218
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,600
Second Childe of Lan.

219
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,280
Clan Leader Jiang.

220
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
You really won't fail the reputation of

221
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
"appearing in chaos".

222
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
So today

223
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,280
you got spare time to visit the rural forest?

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,840
Are you coming

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,040
to take credits from us

226
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,560
or to look for someone?

227
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
I heard you have been to

228
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
a lot of places in the past 16 years.

229
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,720
Clan leader Jiang, what do you mean by that?

230
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,160
What I mean?

231
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Second childe Lan, you know what I mean.

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Childe Jin,

233
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,640
the night hunt is supposed to be a fair competition,

234
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
but you set so many nets

235
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,160
in the Dafan Mountain,

236
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,680
which makes others hardly able to proceed

237
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,840
in fear of those nets.

238
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,160
Aren't you

239
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,920
breaking the rules of the night hunt?

240
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,280
They are caught because

241
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,600
they are stupid.

242
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,680
What can I do about that?

243
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,560
If nothing else,

244
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
let's debate after I catch the prey.

245
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,160
Lan!

246
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,360
What are you doing?

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,280
You are not the one to discipline Ling Jin.

248
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Relieve it now!

249
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,080
Clan Leader Jiang, please don't be angry,

250
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,800
the speech ban of Lan won't hurt people.

251
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,560
The ban will lift in a stick of incense time

252
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,720
if he doesn't force to break it.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,880
Do it now!

254
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,960
Clan Leader!

255
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Clan Leader!

256
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,800
Clan Leader!

257
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,680
Just say it.

258
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,320
What bad news now?

259
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,800
The nets were damaged

260
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,320
by a blue glowing sword just now.

261
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,800
How many?

262
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,120
All, all of them.

263
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,000
Over 400 Denity-biding Nets!

264
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Lan clan of Gusu,

265
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,960
excellent work, huh?

266
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,960
Jin Ling,

267
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,880
Childe Lan wants to teach you a lesson.

268
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,280
You just take it then.

269
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,040
He should dare discipline the junior of a other clan.

270
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,680
It's not easy for him.

271
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Off you go.

272
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes.

273
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,080
Why still standing there?

274
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,000
Waiting for the prey to suicide before you?

275
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,040
If you can't catch

276
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,720
the monster today,

277
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,120
don't come back to me.

278
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Clan Leader Jiang,

279
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,000
We Lan clan of Gusu

280
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,560
will return the nets to you later.

281
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,680
Not necessary.

282
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,640
Go back to your positions.

283
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
Try your best,

284
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
but don't take risks.

285
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay.

286
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,350
Wei Wuxian,

287
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,590
don't stir up trouble again.

288
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,070
Xian, have some soup.

289
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,110
It's your favorite lotus root and ribs soup.

290
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,120
Wei, you said you would assist me.

291
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,240
Don't you remember?

292
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
You said there are the Jade Twin of Gusu,

293
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,480
so we are the Hero Twin of Yunmeng.

294
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,040
Wuxian,

295
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,680
You, Cheng and I,

296
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
we won't separate.

297
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,320
We will stay together forever.

298
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,560
Senior Sister.

299
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,920
Senior Sister!

300
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
This young Childe Jin

301
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,240
He is spoiled both by the clan of Jin and Jiang.

302
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,520
What a young bossy Childe.

303
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,480
I can't imagine what it will be

304
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,160
when he heritages the Jin clan of Lanling.

305
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,040
Nobody would stand it then.

306
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
It's reasonable.

307
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,680
His parents passed away when he was a child.

308
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,200
So what?

309
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
There are so many people without parents

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,720
What would the world become

311
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,520
if everyone were like him?

312
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,040
But Jin Ling does have a miserable past.

313
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
His father was killed due to Wei Wuxian,

314
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,480
when he was born just a few days.

315
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,240
His mother Jiang Yanli

316
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,160
was also killed due to Wei later on.

317
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640
What a unlucky woman!

318
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
She trusted Wei only to be killed.

319
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,200
No wonder Jiang Cheng hate Wei the Yilng Patriarch so much.

320
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
Jiang never forgave anyone

321
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,840
who used Wei's tricks

322
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,200
during the past 16 years.

323
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
I think Wei Wuxian is to blame.

324
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,880
He has so many enemies.

325
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,360
I can see you lack in some maternal education.

326
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Jin Ling is my sister's son.

327
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
How could I say that to him.

328
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
I thought I could be indifferent to the world,

329
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,600
but nobody can repress his feelings after all.

330
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,680
Apple!

331
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,080
You are back!

332
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,320
Sizhui,

333
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,840
We have searched everywhere.

334
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,960
It's nothing here

335
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,120
related to the soul-eating monsters.

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,480
Who are you?

337
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
Why did you hide?

338
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,040
Sir,

339
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
what are you doing here?

340
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,680
I'm the watchman,

341
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
looking after these graves.

342
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,280
I thought it's the monster here.

343
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,480
Sir,

344
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,600
how long have you been here?

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
I can't recall.

346
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,280
At the beginning,

347
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,480
Master Wen asked me to watch over the graves,

348
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,600
I dare not leave.

349
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,800
Later,

350
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,120
more people were dead.

351
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,320
The graves here then became more and more,

352
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,280
which easily attracts

353
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,440
evil stuff.

354
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,440
Is there anything strange in the Dafan Mountain?

355
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
Yes.

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
You can see yourselves at the Tiannv Temple at the top of the mountain,

357
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,600
There stands a dacing fairy statue.

358
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,440
It's a stone

359
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,160
looks like a person.

360
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,520
How weird.

361
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,720
At that time,

362
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
Master Wen,

363
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,720
Master Wen said,

364
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,920
what did he say...

365
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,080
Let's have a look at the temple.

366
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
Maybe there are some clues.

367
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:19,960
Master Wen...

368
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,840
Thank you, sir.

369
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
What on earth,

370
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,920
did he say?

371
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Master Wen...

372
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,800
I got it!

373
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,920
The stone there

374
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,400
can move.

375
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,520
You stupid donkey,

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,040
eat all day.

377
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,640
Apple,

378
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
this is...

379
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,560
soul-gathering grass.

380
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,920
Such grass can gather spiritual energy from the earth,

381
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,320
which usually grows besides cultivators' graves.

382
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,200
Maybe there are

383
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,760
lots of cultivators' graves around.

384
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm amazed.

385
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,480
You're really good at eating.

386
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,080
This place is surrounded with dark fog

387
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,600
because many cultivators are buried here.

388
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,640
The spiritual energy lingers for long,

389
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,640
and then nourishes the grass.

390
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Excuse me.

391
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,920
Which family do the graves belong to?

392
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
They disappeared long ago.

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
The Wen clan had disappeared.

394
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,440
Wen clan.

395
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,120
Wen clan.

396
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,880
Wei Wuxian

397
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,880
My families are buried here.

398
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,360
No.

399
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,120
It's not the soul-eater.

400
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,920
Damn it, Jin Ling is in danger.

401
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,160
Where is the old man?

402
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,240
It was said that hundreds of years ago,

403
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,160
a hunter from Fojiao Town went to the mountain

404
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,720
and found a strange stone in a cave

405
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,120
which is extremely like human.

406
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,960
It has four limbs

407
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,680
featuring a dancing gesture.

408
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,440
What's more,

409
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,400
the statue even has a vivid face

410
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,920
of a smiling woman.

411
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,040
People in Fojiao Town saw it as a miracle

412
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
and made up many fairy tales about it.

413
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,280
According to the local,

414
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
wishing here is really efficacious.

415
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
Why is the temple so dilapidated now?

416
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,560
Nobody came to clean?

417
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,040
A stone from nowhere

418
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,680
was put here with no explanation.

419
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,520
It should be reckoned as a divinity

420
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,640
and be served.

421
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,000
The ignorant villagers

422
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,400
pray all day.

423
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,720
But they don't know that gods can't even hold themselves,

424
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,520
let alone a stone.

425
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,720
If it is efficacious as people say,

426
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,600
now I wish

427
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,360
the monster in the Dafan Mountain show up immediately

428
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,920
in front of me.

429
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,280
Can the stone do that?

430
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,520
Yes.

431
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
Young Childe Jin is right.

432
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,360
What's wrong with you?

433
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
Wake up!

434
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,160
Senior Mo!

435
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,760
Get out of here!

436
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,680
Watch out! It's a statue eating souls.

437
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
The, the stone just moved.

438
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,840
Don't hesitate. Run!

439
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,960
Kids.

440
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,680
Wait for me!

441
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
Who are your kids?

442
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
Do you know our clan?

443
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Alright.

444
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,760
Brothers, brothers

445
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,440
can you set off a smoke shell of yours

446
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
and ask your Childe Lan

447
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,560
for help?

448
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,280
Gosh.

449
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,080
The shells were used up at Mo's Manor that night.

450
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,040
All of them.

451
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,080
You didn't supplement some?

452
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,160
I forgot.

453
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
You forgot?

454
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,920
You are going to be punished

455
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,920
if your Childe knows.

456
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,920
We're doomed.

457
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,760
This time Childe Lan will severely punish us.

458
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,640
Punish,

459
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,640
you are supposed to take a lesson.

460
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,480
Or you won't remember next time.

461
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,320
Senior Mo,

462
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,440
how did you know

463
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,560
it's the fairy statue that eats souls?

464
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,800
I saw.

465
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,360
What did you see?

466
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Old graves.

467
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,080
So I infer

468
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,720
it's not something soul-eaters do.

469
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,200
Why?

470
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,560
You Lan clan of Gusu

471
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,440
learn too much about cultivators' etiquette,

472
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,520
cultivation and family history.

473
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,720
All meaningless and painful to recite.

474
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,720
They should teach you something useful.

475
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Soul-eating monster and soul-eating spectre

476
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,840
live on undissipated spiritual energy

477
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,640
of the dead.

478
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,920
Question.

479
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,720
There are so many

480
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,480
cultivators' graves and their spiritual energy

481
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
left behind.

482
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,720
Why do they aim at living people?

483
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,520
It seems reasonable.

484
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,520
Wait.

485
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,240
You are not crazy.

486
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
What about the lady Yan?

487
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Question 2,

488
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,880
her fiance was gone,

489
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,920
what can she do

490
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,720
as a weak woman?

491
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,080
Pray for gods.

492
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,880
Sure.

493
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,640
And there's something special about Yan.

494
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,880
Among all the victims,

495
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,760
only her soul was back.

496
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,880
Eh...

497
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,880
Yan's father

498
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,000
loves his daughter so much.

499
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,080
When he knew Yan's soul was lost

500
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
and medicine was useless

501
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,000
what would he do?

502
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,520
I know.

503
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
He also went to pray.

504
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,840
So,

505
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,920
he also went to the temple

506
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,080
in order to

507
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,240
find Yan's soul back.

508
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,520
Correct.

509
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,520
The fairy statue returned Yan's soul,

510
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,960
but her soul had already been affected.

511
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,240
That's why Yan

512
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,400
imitates the fairy statue's gesture and smile.

513
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,520
So when Jin Ling said his wish,

514
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,360
"now I wish

515
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,920
the monster in the Dafan Mountain

516
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,320
show up immediately

517
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,320
in front of me."

518
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,000
the statue was brought to life!

519
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,440
Jin Ling.

520
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,200
Do anyone see Jin Ling?

521
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Why the statue has

522
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,440
the full image of human?

523
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,400
Weird.

524
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,040
Lan Zhan and I sealed her.

525
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,160
What brought her to life?

526
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,840
Childe Jin, release the signal.

527
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Why do you take my sword?

528
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Why are you playing the flute at this moment?

529
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,560
And sounds awful.

530
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,920
You're crazy after all.

531
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,270
= Wen Ning, courtesy name is Qionglin =

532
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,960
Wen Ning?

533
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,520
Wen Ning should be dead.

534
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,080
Why him?

535
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,760
What the hell is this?

536
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
It's the Ghost General.

537
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,560
Ghost General Wen Ning.

538
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,080
Wen Ning should have died 16 years ago

539
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,960
along with the Yiling Patriarch .

540
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,160
No.

541
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,560
It's illusion.

542
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,520
Who made this

543
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,320
and why?

544
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,480
Just want me to call out Wen Ning?

545
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,880
The fairy is gone.

546
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,600
It's illusive.

547
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,480
What?

548
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,880
Surround him!

549
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,320
Everyone! Don't let him escape!

550
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,800
He is that Wen Ning!

551
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,560
Why are you afraid? Don't be afraid!

552
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,080
Yiling Patriarch is not here.

553
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,800
Yes.

554
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,920
No need to worry.

555
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
His master has died.

556
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Go!

557
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
My fluting was too fierce,

558
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
which stirred up his temper.

559
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,000
I have to stabilize him.

560
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
Ling.

561
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,480
Uncle.

562
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
You didn't carry signal shells?

563
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,200
What did you meet?

564
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,240
Don't pretend to be brave.

565
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Come back here now!

566
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,960
You told me to catch it anyhow.

567
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,920
Don't talk back.

568
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,880
Clan Leader.

569
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,600
What on earth is that?

570
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,320
How could it cause you such trouble?

571
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,680
Clan Leader,

572
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,680
it's Wen Ning.

573
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,480
What?

574
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,680
Wen Ning is back.

575
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
Wen Ning.

576
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,040
It's Wen Ning.

577
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,160
Truly.

578
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,440
He was executed long time ago.

579
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,560
Impossible.

580
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,800
It's true,

581
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,800
I can't have seen it wrong.

582
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,440
He called Wen Ning out.

583
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,480
Great.

584
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,320
You are back,

585
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,680
Lan Wangji, how dare you.

586
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,600
So what?

587
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,800
You thought you can beat people as your will

588
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
because you are rich and powerful?

589
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
Why it didn't work?

590
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,920
Why it didn't work?

591
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Impossible.

592
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,640
Take off your mask.

593
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,440
No.

594
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,320
You!

595
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,080
You will be shocked to death if I take it off.

596
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,480
Clan Leader, please stop.

597
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,040
That's purple lightening.

598
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,680
The purple lightening can recognize

599
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,240
souls that possess others' bodies.

600
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Wei Wuxian's body

601
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,040
and soul were both lost

602
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,560
after he died.

603
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,760
He can't resurrect except for possessing bodies.

604
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,520
How do you know Wei died for sure?

605
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,880
People say

606
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,080
you killed him in person.

607
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,920
Tell me.

608
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,360
Who are you?

609
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,800
Wei Wuxian,

610
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,680
go to hell!

611
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,560
Sometimes,

612
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,520
I really want to go back to 16 years ago,

613
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,320
back to Lotus Cove.

614
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,840
Even it's a dream.

615
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,400
I am willing to stay dreaming.

616
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,680
Wuxian,

617
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,000
16 years ago

618
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,480
Xian,
16 years ago

619
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,600
Xian,

620
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,120
Xian,

621
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,760
I'll release the dog if you don't get up.

622
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,200
Dog.

623
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,680
Fresh loquat!

624
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,720
Fresh out from trees!

625
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,120
Don't make fun of Xian.

626
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,960
You're here.

627
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,400
Let me get up.

628
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,760
I'm coming.

629
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,160
Senior Sister, everyone is here.

630
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
We haven't reached the Cloud Recesses.

631
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,800
Here is Caiyi Town.

632
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,000
Is anything fun here?

633
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
We are here for the lecture.

634
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,320
You only have playing in mind.

635
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,280
It's fun to do something forbidden.

636
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,840
Alright, you two.

637
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,760
Here is not home.

638
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,040
Remember to behave yourselves.

639
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,320
Look at him.

640
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,200
What's wrong with me?

641
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,080
I want this.

642
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,920
Excuse me, Excuse me.

643
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
See,

644
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,960
bunny, interesting?

645
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,840
Interesting.

646
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,960
Wei Wuxian, stop playing.

647
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,560
We are getting closer to the Cloud Recesses.

648
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,760
This time

649
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,680
pupils from all famous clans will come.

650
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,120
Don't let others look down upon us

651
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,440
because of you.

652
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,600
Okay.

653
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,120
And,

654
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
you should keep in mind too.

655
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,720
From now on,

656
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,680
what we do and say

657
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,520
represents our Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

658
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,640
Yes, sir.

659
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,280
Wei Wuxian.

660
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,560
Did you hear my words?

661
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,200
Sister,

662
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,040
we had a long journey from Yumeng

663
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,960
and exhausted.

664
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,160
I think we can find a tavern to take a rest

665
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,600
and then go to the Cloud Recesses

666
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,000
in order to keep a good image.

667
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,400
Sure.

668
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,200
There are 10 days before the salute ceremony.

669
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,560
It's been a long journey,

670
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,720
Let's take a rest here.

671
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,040
Are we going to stay here for a while?

672
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,360
I heard Emperor's Smile liquor of Gusu is the most famous.

673
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
Tastes soft and full-bodied. Drunk to forget all worries.

674
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,520
I've been coveting it for a long time.

675
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,800
I can finally taste it.

676
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,440
Wei Wuxian, don't drink.

677
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,560
I have to.

678
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,240
Moderate drinking can ease one's mind,

679
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,200
why stop me?

680
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,520
You!

681
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,560
Father shouldn't have let you come.

682
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:27,840
You!

683
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,200
Quiet, both of you.

684
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,520
Let's find a tavern first.

685
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,640
Wei Wuxian, remember to...

686
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,200
I know. I know. I can even recite your words now.

687
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,320
I gotta go.

688
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,000
Senior Sister, look at him.

689
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,000
I have this feeling

690
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,120
he will definitely make trouble

691
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,240
at the Cloud Recesses.

692
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,960
Xian is born vivacious.

693
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,040
It's not a bad thing.

694
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,320
Father also says so sometimes.

695
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,640
Sister,

696
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,920
you and father always defend him.

697
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,880
No way will he change his character.

698
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,600
Besides,

699
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,080
we Jiang clan of Yunmeng

700
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,360
have always been instructed to feel free, right?
