We don't need to do this.

170
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Wen Qi, Wen Qi.

For the Qishan Temple,

174
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
this is not a good idea.

175
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,420

Master.

182
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
I don't know why you are here.

183
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
You have a long way to go.

184
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I have never been to the Lan Temple

185
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
before.

186
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
I am here before you.

187
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
I don't know what to tell you.

188
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Master.

189
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
You are wrong.

190
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
I am not here to listen to you.

191
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
I just am here to give you a message.

192
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Besides,

193
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,500
Strat devotee zone will never keep the strict eye on you.

194
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,320
One doesn't need to say

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,540
Company Leone is only good,

196
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,800
Such a little man.

197
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,640
Since that happens,

198
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,900
Young Master Wen.

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,480
Why are you here to present yourself?

200
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,720
Where has your coming from?

201
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,480
How dare Du D stars

202
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
come from too colorful ends?

203
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,020
I dare not to offend you.

204
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,220
My junior brother Jiang Cheng

205
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,980
was in the form of a master.

206
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,580
How can you be so arrogant?

207
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,220
Is your Qishan Wenshi

208
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,420
that is how you call him?

209
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,220
Okay.

210
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,420
Today I will show you

211
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,620
how our Qishan Wenshi

212
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,820
is going to fix those

213
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,220
disobedient things.

214
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,220
Master Wen,

215
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
you just keep your word.

216
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,820
Why do you have to be so mean?

217
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,820
Yun Meng is a master of martial arts.

218
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,620
He doesn't teach me

219
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,820
how to avoid people saying I have no rules.

220
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,420
Qishan Wenshi

221
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,220
You don't need to tell me

222
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,220
the truth.

223
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,220
Master Wen,

224
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,220
I am here today

225
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,820
to pay my respects to the master.

226
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
Please forgive me.

227
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Qishan Wenshi Master

228
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,820
vibes with Yun Meng exceptional!

229
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,780
Child,

230
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:20,940
you are only the scout in this eliminating

231
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,940
ELI and Qishan.

232
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,220
You are my buddy.

233
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,860
Soylings?

234
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
The Master WenRay

235
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:47,820
Such a dirty guaranteed best��

236
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,240
Take a look.

237
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:11,020
Let's do it.

238
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,840
Sir Wen,

239
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,040
I'm just here to see you.

240
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,760
This time, Qi Shan Wen Shi sent someone to attend the school.

241
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,840
It's really rare.

242
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,960
And the second young master Wen Chao came to see me personally.

243
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,560
Wen Chao is usually very rude.

244
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,720
He's very stupid.

245
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,440
It's even more familiar to me.

246
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,720
So, Wei Xiu, you're really amazing.

247
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
You dare to fight against him.

248
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,880
Other than you, I'm afraid you won't have the second one.

249
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,280
If he's the one who's in trouble,

250
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,080
fighting against such a person

251
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
is the best thing to do.

252
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,080
Wei Xiu, I want to have the courage to be like you.

253
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,120
His courage is not comparable to others.

254
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Listen,

255
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,080
if you want to practice courage,

256
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,680
you have to play first.

257
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Play?

258
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,680
How?

259
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,960
I can teach you.

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,400
We can play with this cloud body

261
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,360
and the head.

262
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
How is it?

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,040
There's a detail on the back mountain.

264
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
We can go to the Mo Yu.

265
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,760
Is Wei Xiu really like this?

266
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,080
Of course.

267
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,520
Enough.

268
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,680
Stop talking nonsense.

269
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,480
Wei Wuxian,

270
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
tomorrow is the official school.

271
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,960
Don't forget.

272
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,000
The rules of the school are over.

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,280
There are 260 times.

274
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,480
You're here again.

275
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,200
You can't stop talking about this.

276
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,840
Wei Xiu, I heard that Lan Shi...

277
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,760
Brother Ji.

278
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,280
Brother Ji, it's me.

279
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
It's me.

280
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,240
I'm sure you didn't hear it.

281
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,880
Your ears are not good.

282
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,280
Wei Xiu,

283
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,000
you dare to go to the Lan Zhan, the Lan Er,

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,800
who's popular with the people.

285
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
I've been here for so long.

286
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
I've seen him and I'm just going around.

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,880
What's the point?

288
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm telling you,

289
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,840
I even fought with him last night.

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
No.

291
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,600
You fought with Lan Wangji?

292
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,800
Wei Xiu, you're so arrogant.

293
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm telling you,

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,080
you two didn't know

295
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,680
how angry that Qin Jing was last night.

296
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,960
He was so angry that he turned the wall over

297
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,080
and took a bottle of Tianzi wine.

298
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,240
Lan Zhan.

299
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Uncle.

300
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
When I was studying at the Lan family,

301
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
I never sent my children here.

302
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,520
Although I've just come to a group of people

303
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,920
from the Lan family,

304
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm afraid they're not that useful.

305
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,120
Xi Chen,

306
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,560
at this moment,

307
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,120
no matter what their purpose is,

308
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,240
we just need to be polite and considerate.

309
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,040
Uncle, you're right.

310
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Xi Chen,

311
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
you still have concerns?

312
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Yes, Uncle.

313
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm thinking

314
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
that the Wen clan is using the Fire Formation

315
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
and that those Kuilei...

316
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I wonder if it has anything to do with it.

317
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Since the arrival of the Immortal Poison,

318
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
the Immortal Sect has been doing well.

319
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
It's like the late night sky.

320
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
It's like a city.

321
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
There are countless guests in the door.

322
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
In recent years,

323
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
it's even more impolite and impolite.

324
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
It's a strong and weak spirit.

325
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
If this Sheling matter

326
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
really has anything to do with the Immortal Sect,

327
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm afraid

328
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
it's not just the two of us

329
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,040
that we can be sure of.

330
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Lord Ze Wu.

331
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Lord Meng.

332
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Lord Meng,

333
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
aren't you going to rest

334
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
after the ceremony?

335
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
I came here to say goodbye to you.

336
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Goodbye?

337
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Lord Meng,

338
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
why don't you go out with me for a few days?

339
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

340
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I'd better go back earlier.

341
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
If that's the case,

342
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
I won't be able to stay longer.

343
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Lord Meng,

344
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Lord Nie is a bright and bright person.

345
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
He's very well-mannered.

346
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
As long as he's a skilled person,

347
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
he won't be able to stay.

348
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
I'll leave it to you.

349
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
The ceremony is over.

350
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Thank you for your help.

351
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
It's serious.

352
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
We're all the same age.

353
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
We don't need to worry about it.

354
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I'll take my leave.

355
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
You're really so pretty.

356
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Yes.

357
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Brother Wen!

360
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I...

361
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
You ran away, Yu.

362
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
You're in a hurry.

363
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
You're in a hurry.

364
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Give it to me.

365
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Give it to me.

366
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Give it to me.

367
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Give it to me.

368
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Brother Nie,

369
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
if you don't help me,

370
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
forget it.

371
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
I finally caught a fish for you.

372
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
You still let me go?

373
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
I mean, Brother Wei,

374
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
we're all the same age.

375
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
We're all the same age.

376
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
We're all the same age.

377
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
We're all the same age.

378
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Besides,

379
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
we have magic.

380
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Where do we need to catch fish?

381
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
You have to use magic to catch fish?

382
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
That's so boring.

383
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
You want me to take you to the lake?

384
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Isn't it just a fun place

385
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
to go on a mountain and go down the river?

386
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,040
That makes sense.

387
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Let's continue.

388
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Don't look for it.

389
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,040
There are so many fish, Brother Nie.

390
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Help! Help!

391
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Help! Help!

392
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
There are no fish.

393
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Look!

394
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Look behind you!

395
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Look behind you!

396
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Let's go!

397
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Over there!

398
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Wei Xiao!

399
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Wei Xiao!

400
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Wei Xiao!

401
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Wei Xiao!

402
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Miss Wen!

403
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Miss Wen!

404
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
What are you doing here?

405
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Your silver needle is quite good.

406
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Don't move.

407
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
No one has told you

408
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
not to touch the silver needle of the doctor?

409
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Only someone has told me

410
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,040
that there is a female doctor

411
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,040
in the Wenshi.

412
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
She is very cruel.

413
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
She can't touch it.

414
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Miss Wen!

415
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
You haven't told me

416
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
what you are doing here.

417
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
You can't enter the mountain

418
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
without knowing where the Cloud Recesses are.

419
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
If there is no evidence,

420
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
you won't come here for a walk, right?

421
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
What evidence

422
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
do you have to come to the mountain?

423
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
I...

424
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I...

425
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
I...

426
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
I...

427
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I have something to prove.

428
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Catch the fish.

429
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
I'm going.

430
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Cheng, don't be too tired.

431
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Tomorrow is the day

432
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
when you will be studying.

433
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I will study these days.

434
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I won't let anyone

435
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
give up on me for a day.

436
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
It's a rare day.

437
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Go with her.

438
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
When will she

439
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
think about the future of Yunmeng?

440
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Cheng,

441
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
our family is a family of the future.

442
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
We are born in the same family.

443
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
We are born in the same family.

444
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
We are born in the same family.

445
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Isn't Xian the kind of person

446
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
who is so kind?

447
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
You don't have to worry about him.

448
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Ask him to take a bath.

449
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Come in the water.

450
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Go and enjoy.

451
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,960
You should've tapes said

452
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
if you were just there.

453
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,280
We neverНАЯ

454
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,000
lead a proper social life on a social.

455
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,840
I don't have any.

456
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
You're all here.

457
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,640
You...

458
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,560
Be quiet.

459
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,200
Sister, look.

460
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,160
I...

461
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,000
Sister,

462
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,880
the fish with spring cabbage soup

463
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
is the most delicious.

464
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,460
Can't believe how delicious the grand transparency wontこれ.

465
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,400
She's already thinking.

466
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,040
Here's a pretty good boy.

467
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
I really want to eat this part.

468
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,200
Come on.

469
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,440
You can't eat it anymore.

470
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,200
Who is the dead duck?

471
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Who is the dead duck?

472
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,000
You...

473
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,840
Okay, you two.

474
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,040
Cheng.

475
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,920
Xian.

476
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,840
You can't come back tomorrow

477
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
after school.

478
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,640
I promise,

479
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,640
just like what Mrs. Yu said,

480
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,000
I will not make things worse.

481
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Have some soup.

482
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,120
Ziti.

483
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,460
Yu Qingxia,

484
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,940
you are here.

485
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,720
Take a bath.

486
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm Jian.

487
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,760
This is my first meal in the temple.

488
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,560
I'll take care of him.

489
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,920
Th microf Private.

490
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,480
You are so handsome,

491
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,400
such an important couple.

492
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,600
We will try our strength to立 a family of them first.

493
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,840
May they rest in peace as you serve us.

494
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,180
Wards to penalty

495
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,620
This потерry is mine

496
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,800

As taking it's pride

500
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,160
As after drinking it's purity

501
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,240
Wsh would make it saves

502

In nasal mouth

503
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,140
and immortal.

504
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,700

I don't want to report you.

508
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
I don't want to destroy you.

509
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,700
The so-called kind people are calm and quiet.

510
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
They are all aware of the world.

511
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
They follow the path.

512
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
They are like the mountains and the gold and the monsters.

513
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
They are like the devils.

514
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
They are just like the king.

515
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Why are you laughing?

516
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Don't laugh.

517
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Go away.

518
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Remove the Demon Blood.

519
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
True Law 771

520
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,400
»Burn into a nail in the earth.

521
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,240
He should stick to the nail bats JamคvImacling a ferrary limit.''

522
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,240
You can't be unruly, you can't be impulsive, you can't be cunning,

523
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,240
you can't be so petty and make others do things.

524
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,240
You can't be unruly, you can't be so generous.

525
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,240
You can't take money from others, you can't be late.

526
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
No!

527
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Yes!

528
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
No!

529
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Since you don't need to listen to me, I'll come to test you.

530
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Is the demon a monster or something else?

531
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
No.

532
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Why not? How to distinguish?

533
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,240
The demon is not a living creature, the demon is a human.

534
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,240
The devil is a dead person, the monster is a dead person.

535
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,240
The demon is a living creature, how to distinguish?

536
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:59,240
It's better to say that the living creature behind you is a human.

537
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,240
If I take the power of the Manor, the demon will cut off the dead person.

538
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
He will cultivate the capital and become a monster.

539
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,240
What do you think of the Immortal Clan?

540
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,240
I think it's a white-and-white-and-white-and-white-and-white-and-white-and-white-and-white.

541
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
It's a new blood.

542
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Who is the first person to be the first to be the Immortal Clan?

543
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
The Immortal Clan of Qishan.

544
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
As a son of the Immortal Clan,

545
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,240
these old-fashioned skills are not as good as they used to be.

546
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,240
It's not a good thing to do.

547
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Let me ask you again.

548
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
There is a貴 hand.

549
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Her parents are all children.

550
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
She was a hundred years old.

551
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
She was a hundred years old.

552
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
She was seven days old.

553
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
She was a hundred years old.

554
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
She was seven days old.

555
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
She was seven days old.

556
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
She was seven days old.

557
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
She was seven days old.

558
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm sorry.

559
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Don't talk nonsense.

560
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Think about it yourself.

561
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Wang Ji.

562
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Tell her who is the first person to be the Immortal Clan.

563
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
There are three ways.

564
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,240
De savory flower's first,

565
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
eding leverage is the second,

566
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
killing the third.

567
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
First, GOD should see Cai's suffering

568
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:39,760
from

569
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Jin fortune in the brutality of smart bow

570
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
by other countries.

571
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Eso doesn't sound like that.

572
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Whether it's cultivation or human,

573
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,240
it should all be a mess.

574
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
If it's because of a few of the strange creatures

575
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
that have not entered the world,

576
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
some of them are arrogant and arrogant,

577
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
and are mischievous.

578
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,240
They will soon get into their own trap.

579
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Sir, I have a question.

580
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Go ahead.

581
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Although it's the first one with the word Du,

582
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
it's always impossible to get Du.

583
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,240
It's easy to say that it's a dream to get Du.

584
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,240
If it's a dream, it's easy to get a new one.

585
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
But if it's to destroy the whole world

586
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,240
and avenge the bloodshed, what should we do?

587
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
It's not about Du.

588
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
It's about me.

589
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
If it's not possible, we should destroy it.

590
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
It's about the sky.

591
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Actually, I didn't know the answer just now.

592
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,240
I was just thinking about the fourth one.

593
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,240
You never heard of the fourth one.

594
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Tell me.

595
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,240
It's a matter of course that a kneeler would hate to die.

596
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Since he has been a hundred-men in his life,

597
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,240
why don't he just take the hundred-men's grave

598
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,240
and take the hundred-men's head and fight with the evil spirits?

599
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
I don't know the future.

600
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
The evil spirit is evil and the evil spirit is evil.

601
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
You don't just die from Du.

602
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
You have to be willing to die.

603
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
I'm not going to let you down.

604
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Sir, some things can't be Du.

605
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Why don't you use them?

606
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
The rain and the water are all colored.

607
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
The color is the top.

608
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
The pillow is the color.

609
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Why don't you use them?

610
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Sir, the spirit is the spirit.

611
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
The spirit is the spirit.

612
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
The spirit is the only one.

613
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
It can be used by the mountains and the sea.

614
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
The spirit is also good.

615
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Why can't you use it?

616
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Then I'll ask you again.

617
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
How can you guarantee that the spirit is not what you use

618
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
but what you harm others?

619
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I haven't thought about it yet.

620
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
If you think about it,

621
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
the whole family will be disliked by you.

622
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Get out!

623
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Go to the library to copy a thousand lizi pieces.

624
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Thank you.

625
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Wang Ji, you go.

626
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Take him to the library.

627
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Don't copy a thousand lizi pieces.

628
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Don't leave!

629
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Yes.

630
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Sir Wen, it's a nice way to see you.

631
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Thank you.

632
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Sir Wen, it's a nice way to see you.

633
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Sorry, I was scared of you.

634
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Wen, you are so good at shooting arrows.

635
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Why didn't you meet me at the Qingtan Society?

636
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Sir, please forgive me.

637
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
I'm a little bit shy.

638
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Please teach me more.

639
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
It's serious.

640
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
You are so talented.

641
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
You are not a common person.

642
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Let's make up for each other.

643
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Let's make up for each other.

644
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
By the way, Wen,

645
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
why don't you go to school?

646
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
There is no one here.

647
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
You can practice alone.

648
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm still young.

649
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
I'm not qualified to go to school.

650
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Sir Wen,

651
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
why are you here?

652
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Well,

653
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm not sure.

654
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,240
I was kicked out by Mr. Lan.

655
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Let's talk about it.

656
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I won't talk about it.

657
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
I saw you shooting arrows.

658
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,240
You are strong,

659
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
but you are not good at shooting.

660
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
How about this?

661
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
I'll adjust it for you.

662
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Okay.

663
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Come on, put your hands down.

664
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Put your hands on your back.

665
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Open your back.

666
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Push the ball.

667
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Make a target.

668
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
Wait a minute.

669
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
I'll kill you.

670
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Okay, target.

671
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Wen Ning.

672
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Sister.

673
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Why are you with him?

674
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
He is a good man.

675
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
He is shooting arrows at me.

676
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Miss Wen,

677
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I haven't asked you yet.

678
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Why can I see you

679
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
near the back mountain?

680
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Do you follow me secretly?

681
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Or do you want to find something

682
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
in the back mountain of Lan City?

683
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Wei Wuxian,

684
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
don't talk nonsense.

685
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
I'll kill you.

686
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
What secret is there

687
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
in the back mountain of Lan City?

688
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
Brother Ji,

689
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
it's you.

690
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Brother Ji,

691
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
I'm sorry.

693
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
I'm sorry.

694
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
I'm sorry.

695
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
I'm sorry.

696
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
I'm sorry.

697
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I'm sorry.

698
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
I'm sorry.

699
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I'm sorry.

700
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I'm sorry.

701
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
I'm sorry.

703
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I'm sorry.

711
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
I'm sorry.

714
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
I'm sorry.

723
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
I'm sorry.

727
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I'm sorry.

728
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I'm sorry.

729
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
I'm sorry.

730
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,240
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,240
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,240
I'm sorry.

737
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
I'm sorry.

738
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,240
I'm sorry.

739
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm sorry.

740
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,240
I'm sorry.

741
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
I'm sorry.

742
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
I'm sorry.

743
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
I'm sorry.

744
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
I'm sorry.

745
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I'm sorry.
