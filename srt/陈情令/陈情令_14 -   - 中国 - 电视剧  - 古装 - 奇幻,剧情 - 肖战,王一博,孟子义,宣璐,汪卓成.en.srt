1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 14

3
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
You wake up?

4
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,240
OK.

5
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
So it is around 5 a.m. in the morning now.

6
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,640
For fear that you feels nervous without the headband.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
I put it on for you.

8
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,160
I swam around at the bottom of the pond just now.

9
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,040
I found that guy really smart.

10
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,920
He would discover us within the time of burning a joss stick.

11
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,120
I haven't found out the hole Jiang Cheng mentioned.

12
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
I am afraid

13
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,400
it has been plugged by the monster.

14
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
With your wound

15
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,160
you shouldn't go into the water.

16
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,160
I'm not so delicate.

17
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
But you.

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,520
How is the effect of the medicine Wen Ning gave me?

19
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,800
Jiang Cheng has left for so long.

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,680
I don't know how long it will be before he find reinforcements.

21
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
I guess

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
we still have to stay here

23
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
for a period of time

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
And against the monster

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
we still have a fight.

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,880
What do you think

27
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
the monster looks like?

28
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
A turtle.

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
A big turtle.

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
There's a kind of mythic creature

31
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
with the similar shape.

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,640
Mythic creature?

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
What you mentioned

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,880
is the mythic creature Xuanwu, right?

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Xuanwu is also called Xuanming.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,080
The combination of tortoise and snake, kind of Water Immortal.

37
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Exactly.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,480
Is any mythic creature the same as this

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
with a mouth filled with ugly tushes.

40
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,480
And it even eats human.

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,360
There's a big gap between the imagination and the reality!

42
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,320
It is not the real mythic creature Xuanwu.

43
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
But

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
I have heard that there was a fake Xuanwu.

45
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,240
It is similar to this monster.

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,040
Fake Xuanwu.

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,950
What is that?

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Do you still remember

49
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,560
what Senior Lan Yi has mentioned before,

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
the Slaughter Xuanwu.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,120
The Slaughter Xuanwu?

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,200
Xue Chonghai manipulated an ancient mythic creature

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,680
the Slaughter Xuanwu.

54
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,600
Oh, I remember.

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
As you mentioned

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,120
it's something like this big turtle.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Could it be that

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,080
the big turtle

59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,440
is what Xue Chonghai left hundreds of years ago

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,400
the Slaughter Xuanwu?

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
That's right.

62
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,400
Never mind.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,200
Whatever it is.

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,000
We have said to be chivalrous and venture together.

65
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,040
If today,

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,640
we can kill the big turtle,

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,520
then we are getting some chivalric fame for ourselves.

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Even if unfortunately we are killed by the monster

69
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,080
it would be a death by the creature aged hundreds, thousands...

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
No, no.

71
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,400
A death by a big monster aged ten thousand years

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,680
is not a shame even if people hear it, right?

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,640
Killer-String.

74
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
The instrument Qin has seven strings

75
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,640
from thick to thin

76
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,960
which can be split and combined.

77
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Cutting bones and meat like cutting mud.

78
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,440
We can break through it from within.

79
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,040
I agree to break through it from within.

80
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,240
But the Killer-String of your Lan clan

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,520
according to what I have heard

82
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
is limited while in the turtle shell

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,680
which can hamper your performance.

84
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
Moreover due to your leg's wound

85
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
the effect of the Killer-String will be greatly reduced.

86
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,840
Listen to me.

87
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,400
The turtle shell of Slaughter Xuanwu is solid as a fort.

88
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,840
The scarfskin is extremely hard.

89
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
It seems impossible to break.

90
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,760
But the more so,

91
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,280
the flesh part hiding in the shell

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
is more likely to be fragile.

93
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
I can creep in its turtle shell

94
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,920
to find its weakness

95
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
and focus on attacking it.

96
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,880
Force it out of the turtle shell.

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,480
Once it is out of the turtle shell,

98
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,550
you can use the Killer-String.

99
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,670
We collaborate from inside and outside

100
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,400
and fight it to our last breath.

101
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,200
Let's see who'd die first.

102
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
Be careful.

103
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
How's that?

104
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
Luckily, you didn't get in.

105
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
Even if the smell doesn't make you vomit,

106
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,270
you'd faint from the stench.

107
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,400
Lan Zhan.

108
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,760
The monster is so horrible.

109
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,280
It not only eats human flesh,

110
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,560
but also digests the their spiritual cognition.

111
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,920
Just like Yin Iron.

112
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,565
The resentment is so strong.

113
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,400
It seems that the sword

114
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,680
gets the Slaughter Xuanwu stuck here.

115
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
Lan Zhan.

116
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,360
Wei Ying.

117
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,960
Wei Ying. Wei Ying.

118
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,280
Wake up. Wake up.

119
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,840
Congratulations, father!

120
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
The power of puppets is boosted.

121
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,640
Unifying all main clans can be expected soon.

122
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,160
Tell Wen Xu to find Xue Yang.

123
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,040
And,

124
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
if there is anyone

125
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,640
concerned with Xue Yang near Yueyang and Qinghe,

126
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,080
you should check it out.

127
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,080
Yes.

128
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,040
But father,

129
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,160
I don't understand one thing.

130
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,400
You have got three shards of Yin Iron.

131
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,320
Why still search for the last one?

132
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
As powerful as three shards are,

133
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,600
never can those puppets be

134
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,160
manipulated without the last one.

135
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,320
I see.

136
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,080
In case that Xue Yang makes puppets at the same time,

137
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,920
even if we have the power of the three shards of Yin Iron,

138
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,680
we can't counter him.

139
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,480
I'm ready to get down to it.

140
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,760
Go ahead.

141
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,120
Is it dead?

142
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,400
Lan Zhan, is it dead?

143
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,320
Yes.

144
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
Yes?

145
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
Has it really died?

146
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,360
Yes, it has.

147
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,400
Lan Zhan.

148
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
Just now I heard

149
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,360
many screamings past my ears

150
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
which knocked me to unconsciousness.

151
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Am I dreaming?

152
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,440
No.

153
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,760
Little did I think before,

154
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
one day in my life,

155
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,640
I could see Second Childe Lan acting so concerned like this,

156
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
Lan Zhan.

157
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,800
I didn't think I could survive just now.

158
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,320
Wei Ying.

159
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,160
You got a fever.

160
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,960
So comfortable, Lan Zhan.

161
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,320
It's so boring.

162
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,560
Why hasn't Jiang Cheng

163
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,320
showed up and rescued me?

164
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,360
It's so quiet.

165
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
Lan Zhan.

166
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,960
Can you sing a song for me?

167
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,160
I know you won't ignore me.

168
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,880
# Hearing the flute, feeling blue #

169
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,280
# Cloud is deep yet night is young #

170
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,200
# Right or wrong passes in flee #

171
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,480
# Wake up, only to find an empty dream #

172
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,520
# How to weigh the tears and laughs, mundane flashes are nothing #

173
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,040
# As hot as the blood, as cold as the blades #

174
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,040
# Somewhere in high hill or lake afar, the Qin was heard again long #

175
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,640
# With my untamed love unfilled, lie in silk flowers with moonlit cream #

176
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,680
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes to memorize the youth #

177
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,320
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

178
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,440
# Why not live at will and go for great adventures #

179
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,200
# Echos a melody from afar #

180
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,120
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes of life to memorize the youth #

181
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,640
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

182
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,760
# Why not live at will and go for great adventures #

183
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,040
# Echos a melody from afar #

184
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,160
Pleasant to hear.

185
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,440
Pleasant to hear.

186
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,400
Lan Zhan.

187
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,240
What's the name of this song?

188
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,360
Wei Wuxian.

189
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
If you're awake, you just get up then.

190
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,840
You are so heavy.

191
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,440
Even the stone is lighter than you.

192
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,880
It's you.

193
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,320
Do not get me wrong.

194
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm not here for you.

195
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,520
In this way

196
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,400
I should thank you a lot.

197
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
Wei Wuxian.

198
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,560
You woke up?

199
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,960
Jiang Cheng.

200
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,240
Wei Wuxian.

201
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
You're finally awake.

202
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,920
Jiang Cheng.

203
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,240
Here you are at last!

204
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,080
It's been many days since you escaped.

205
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,600
How about Lan Zhan?

206
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,640
He has left.

207
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
He has left?

208
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,360
He's still injured.

209
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,080
Who hasn't got any injuries yet?

210
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Now Lan clan of Gusu is in a mess.

211
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,280
He went back first by himself.

212
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,080
Then he...

213
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,120
Wei Wuxian!

214
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,560
Why don't you thank me first?

215
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,160
Do you know that in order to save you,

216
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,600
Childe Jin and I hurried on with our journey

217
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,520
even without our eyes closed for seven days!

218
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,720
Seven days?

219
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,280
It's been that long?

220
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,640
Exactly.

221
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,640
The nearest Gusu and Qinghe

222
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,840
were all occupied by Wen clan.

223
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,560
All of us have to go to Lanling first.

224
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,920
But this time, we should thank Childe Jin.

225
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,560
If Childe Jin hadn't persuaded Clan Leader Jin.

226
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,560
into advocating

227
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,840
to fight against Wen clan,

228
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,520
we couldn't have brought anyone to save you.

229
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
I don't have a sword.

230
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
If I had chose to return to Yunmeng,

231
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,200
it would be more than seven days.

232
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,080
Yeah, I forgot that you all couldn't maneuver the sword.

233
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,320
How about Wen Chao?

234
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
How about his group?

235
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,320
Didn't they stop you?

236
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,640
Strange to say,

237
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,760
I don't know what's happening to Wen clan recently.

238
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,800
Wen Chao and Wen Xu were all sent out.

239
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,400
It seems that they are looking for something.

240
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,120
Otherwise, how could we dig the hole

241
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
and save you out from the cave so easily?

242
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Anyway,

243
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
this time you saved us.

244
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,040
Thank you very much.

245
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,440
Childe Jiang.

246
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,320
Now that they have been rescued,

247
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,240
let's get out of here.

248
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,640
Now, the situation of other clans

249
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,520
joining forces to fight against Wen clan has been decided.

250
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Other survived disciples have gathered in Lanling.

251
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,760
Maybe this will attract Wen Ruohan’s attention.

252
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,360
Although nothing happened for now,

253
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,200
we have to be prepared for Wen clan's retaliation.

254
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,080
Wei Wuxian and I will rush back as soon as possible

255
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,000
to persuade my father

256
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,720
to discuss how to suppress Wen clan together.

257
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,800
Great.

258
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,320
Let's separate here.

259
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,720
Take care.

260
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,560
Unexpectedly,

261
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,520
Jin Zixuan is really responsible.

262
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,120
Let's go.

263
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,040
Wei Wuxian, come on.

264
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,280
Second Childe Wen.

265
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,880
Someone just reported

266
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,680
that...

267
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,800
Say it!

268
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,440
That someone had seen

269
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,320
two Childes of Jing and Jiang

270
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,400
bringing a dozen people and going into Mount Muxi.

271
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,360
They...

272
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,280
What are they doing here again?

273
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,160
Are they here to save Wei Wuxian?

274
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,880
It's been so many days

275
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,360
and Wei and Lan are with that monster turtle.

276
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,680
I think they're here to claim Wei Wuxian's dead body.

277
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,640
You two.

278
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,440
Go to the cave and have a look at Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian

279
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,920
and check whether they are dead or not.

280
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,440
But...

281
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,160
Move!

282
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,320
Understood.

283
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,400
Wen Zhuliu.

284
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,560
You go ahead with Jiaojiao.

285
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,200
Go to Yunmeng and watch them closely.

286
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,400
Report to me whatever happens.

287
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,600
Yes, Childe.

288
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,280
Wei Wuxian.

289
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
This time, even if you're luckily alive,

290
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,840
I'm not going to spare you.

291
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,320
Archer

292
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,920
shall grab the bow and pull the string to shoot,

293
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,280
shall relax the shoulders and tighten the arm,

294
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,640
and shall wait for the right time,

295
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,280
It's the way not to miss even one arrow.

296
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
Wow! Awesome! Awesome!

297
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,800
Master!

298
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,960
From now on, I will study hard to learn archery from you.

299
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,160
Uncle Jiang, I want to shoot kites, too.

300
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,720
Cheng. Xian.

301
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,520
- First senior brother! First senior brother! - Childe!

302
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
Senior sister!

303
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,880
You’re back!

304
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,200
Xian!

305
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,360
First senior brother! First senior brother!

306
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,400
- Xian! - First senior brother!

307
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You’re awake!

308
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,200
Senior sister!

309
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,440
Great. Your fever is finally gone.

310
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,720
Senior sister, I'm thirsty.

311
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,560
All right. Don't worry.

312
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
Sis, the soup that you boiled.

313
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm bringing it over.

314
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,000
Here.

315
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,400
Here.

316
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,800
Lotus root and rib soup!

317
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,000
Good!

318
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,760
Senior sister.

319
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,320
Lotus root and rib soup you made

320
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,040
is the best lotus root and rib soup in the world!

321
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,760
You don't know that

322
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
those days in the Xuanwu cave

323
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,230
when I was hungry,

324
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,480
my mind was full of

325
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,800
the soup made by you.

326
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,000
Take your time. Don't drink it in a rush.

327
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,440
There's more in the pot.

328
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,600
Good!

329
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,040
Xian.

330
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,840
How are you?

331
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,150
Do you feel better?

332
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,880
Don't get out of bed.

333
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,280
Uncle Jiang, I'm much better.

334
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,600
I want Senior sister to wipe my mouth.

335
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,800
Don't you have hands yourself?!

336
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,280
My hands are too heavy

337
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,440
to lift up.

338
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,240
I'll make some other things for you.

339
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Xian.

340
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,720
You suffered a lot this time.

341
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,640
Uncle Jiang,

342
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,080
I'm actually okay.

343
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,600
I just stayed in that cave for a few days.

344
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,240
But it was Jiang Cheng these days

345
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,160
who suffered a lot for saving me.

346
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,160
Well done.

347
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,560
Congratulations.

348
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,680
Congratulate what?

349
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
What a pity that you weren't there as well.

350
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,720
Or else

351
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,240
you'd be able to share some of that credit as well.

352
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
You'd also be able to chat with me

353
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,680
and chase the boredom away.

354
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,320
Good Heavens,

355
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,120
sitting face-to-face with Lan Zhan these days

356
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
almost bored me to death.

357
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
It served you right to be bored to death.

358
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,520
You shouldn't have played the hero back then,

359
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,720
and shouldn't have cared for such hot potato.

360
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,680
If in the beginning you didn't...

361
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,600
Jiang Cheng.

362
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,560
Do you know in which ways what you just said is inappropriate?

363
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,960
Yes.

364
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,560
Uncle Jiang.

365
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,680
It's alright.

366
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,640
He's just angry and speaking without care.

367
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,520
Cheng,

368
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,200
there are some things that can't be said even if you're angry.

369
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,320
If you said them,

370
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,480
it means that

371
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,360
you still don't understand the motto of Jiang clan,

372
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,920
and that you still don't... - Yes.

373
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,840
he doesn't understand, but what does it matter

374
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,000
as long as Wei Ying understands?!

375
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,720
“To try what shouldn't be tried ”

376
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,520
is exactly how he is, isn't it?

377
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Fooling around even though he knew that

378
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,000
it'd bring trouble to his clan?!

379
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,600
What are you doing here?

380
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,880
What a joke that

381
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,200
I am asked of such a thing!

382
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Clan Leader Jiang,

383
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,120
do you still remember

384
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,120
that I'm also the host of Lotus Cove?

385
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,200
Do you still remember

386
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,600
that every inch of earth here is my territory?

387
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,920
Do you still remember,

388
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
between the one lying and the one standing,

389
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,320
which one is your son?

390
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,640
Of course I do.

391
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,360
You do remember

392
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,720
but there's no use if you simply remember.

393
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,040
Wei Ying, you really can't take it

394
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,440
unless he stirs up some trouble for even one day, can you?

395
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,640
If I had known that,

396
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,250
I would've made him stay in Lotus Cove properly

397
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,250
and not go outside.

398
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,680
Could Wen Chao

399
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
really have dared to

400
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,480
do anything to the two young Childes

401
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,440
of Lan and Jin?

402
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,080
Even if he dared,

403
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,880
it'd mean that they ran out of luck.

404
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,080
Since when was it your turn to play the hero?

405
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
I'm saying this right now.

406
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,560
You can just wait and see.

407
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,200
One day,

408
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,920
he'll definitely get our clan into some big trouble!

409
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,880
Enough!

410
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,360
Let's talk when we get back.

411
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,360
Talk about what?

412
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,560
Get back to where?

413
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,040
I'll talk here and now.

414
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,160
I have nothing to be ashamed of, anyways!

415
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,920
Jiang Cheng, come over here.

416
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,720
Clan Leader Jiang,

417
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
it seems that there are some things I have to say.

418
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,560
Look carefully,

419
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,600
this, is your own son,

420
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,440
the future leader of Lotus Cove.

421
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,530
Even if you frown upon him

422
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,680
just because I was the one who gave birth to him,

423
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,680
his surname is still Jiang!

424
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't believe that you haven't heard of

425
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,040
how the outside people gossip

426
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,120
that Clan Leader Jiang has still not moved on from

427
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,640
a certain Wanderer though so many years have passed,

428
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,720
regarding the son of his old friend as a son of his own.

429
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,280
They're speculating

430
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,560
if Wei Ying is your...

431
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,560
Yu Ziyuan!

432
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,280
Jiang Fengmian!

433
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,650
Do you think that anything will change

434
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,475
just because you raised your voice?!

435
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,560
Do you think that I don't know you?!

436
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,120
You!

437
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,600
Stop!

438
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,640
I haven't finished yet.

439
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
Jiang Cheng!

440
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Jiang Cheng!

441
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,040
Jiang Cheng!

442
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,800
Answer me if you heard me!

443
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,800
Are you looking for a fight?!

444
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,200
Go back to your bed and lie down properly!

445
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,760
I can't do that,

446
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,160
we need to get things straight!

447
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,560
You really mustn't listen to that nonsense.

448
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,720
What nonsense?

449
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,360
Those things would dirty my mouth if I should say them.

450
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,680
Wait for me!

451
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,280
Anyway,

452
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,120
both my parents are real people in this world.

453
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,440
I don't want others

454
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,160
assigning me to other households!

455
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,560
Listen!

456
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,040
Let's be honest,

457
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,840
don't hide things so sulkily in your heart.

458
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,080
You're...

459
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,720
Uncle Jiang's own son,

460
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,320
the future leader of Jiang clan.

461
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,280
Of course Uncle Jiang

462
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,640
would be stricter towards you.

463
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,000
But I'm different.

464
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm the son of someone else.

465
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,680
Both of my parents are good friends of Uncle Jiang.

466
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,000
Of course,

467
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,680
he'd cut me more slack.

468
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,680
Such a reason you do understand, don't you?

469
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,120
He's not strict towards me.

470
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,320
He just doesn't like me.

471
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,600
How can there be anyone who doesn't like his own son?

472
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,120
Stop thinking such things!

473
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,560
Those who have loose mouths,

474
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,800
I'll beat them up on the encounter,

475
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
so hard that even their mothers couldn't recognize them.

476
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,320
There is, though.

477
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,600
He doesn't like my mom

478
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,800
and so he doesn't like me either.

479
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,040
I know.

480
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,320
I know that I don't have the personality he likes,

481
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,080
and that I'm not the heir he wants.

482
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,400
He thinks that I don't understand the motto of Jiang clan

483
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,040
and that I don't have the air of Jiang clan in me.

484
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,720
Those are all true!

485
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
You killed the Slaughter Xuanwu together with Lan Wangji

486
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,640
bathing in blood!

487
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,480
How great that is.

488
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,880
But what about me?

489
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,280
I had also been running around for days

490
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,480
completely exhausted

491
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,960
with not one second of rest!

492
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,240
The motto is of nothing.

493
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm telling you.

494
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,800
Do you have to follow it just because it's a motto?

495
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,575
Look at the principles of Lan clan of Gusu,

496
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:26,825
there are over three thousand.

497
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,760
If people followed every single one of them,

498
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,920
would they even be alive at that point?

499
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,680
And

500
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,120
who said that being a clan leader means

501
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,200
you have to go along with the style of the clan?

502
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,200
I don't believe

503
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,000
that so many clan leaders in Jiang clan

504
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,320
were all the same.

505
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,840
Even

506
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,200
Lan clan of Gusu

507
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,120
had a mutant like Lan Yi,

508
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,440
but who could deny her position and her abilities?

509
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,720
When talking about the famous gentry of Lan clan,

510
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
who could skip over her?

511
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,680
Who could skip over her Killer-String?

512
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,720
So...

513
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
just don't think about it.

514
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,160
In the future, you'll be the clan leader

515
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,360
and I'll be your subordinate

516
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,200
like your father and my father.

517
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,040
So if Lan clan of Gusu has its Jade Twin?

518
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,960
Jiang clan of Yunmeng will have its Pride Twin!

519
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,040
So,

520
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,000
no one can say you don't deserve.

521
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,880
Got it?

522
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,720
Even yourself.

523
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,040
If there were someone who says, I'd beat him hard.

524
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,080
Look at yourself now.

525
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,240
Who can you beat up?

526
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,200
Jiang Cheng!

527
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
You're hurting so much now,

528
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,880
but why did you play the hero back then?!

529
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,800
Serves you right!

530
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,840
Teaches you a lesson!

531
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,160
Was I playing the hero?!

532
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,560
I had no other choice then!

533
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,720
Jiang Cheng.

534
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,400
Do you think we'll meet them again?

535
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,720
How do I know?
