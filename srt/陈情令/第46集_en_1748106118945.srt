1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fifth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
fiscal intermediary

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,000
we only know five

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
three

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
shuttle JD

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
why

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:16,000
if you want to go to the capital

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,880
JD

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,000
it is clear to know howス

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
What's wrong?

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
No wonder he said to Uncle Qin in the secret room.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Song must die.

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Look, look.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm right.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I've heard that his son

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
wasn't killed by others.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
He was the one who killed him.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Chief Yang,

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
we all know

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,600
that the son of Brother Qin was born.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,800
He was born in 1989.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
When he was too young,

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
others couldn't see what he was doing.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
But when he grew up,

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
he would be exposed

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
to the public.

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
But if he was born in a generation,

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
then others would be jealous of Jin Guangyao

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,000
and say something.

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
They would even say that

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Jin Guangyao was born with a long-term blood.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
That's why he was born with such a child.

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
That's why he was so strict.

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,000
And

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,600
we should think about it.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
At that time,

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
the one who killed Jin Wusong

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
was the one who opposed him

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
as the leader of the country.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How could there be such a coincidence?

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,200
So,

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
he didn't listen to me.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
He just killed Jin Wusong

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,200
and married the one who opposed him.

72
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Then,

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
he gave his son the name of the leader.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
He made a big fuss about

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
the opposition of his family.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Although he was cold-hearted,

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
he was a good man.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,600
But,

79
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,400
he was very good at it.

80
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Jin Lin Tai,

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
the Qingtan meeting.

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
Have you seen Qin Su?

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,800
I...

84
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
At that night, in the Fangfei Hall,

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Qin Su and Jin Guangyao

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
had a fight.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,400
He said he saw someone.

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
He told him about something.

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
He even gave him a letter.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
He said he would never lie to him.

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Is it you?

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's me.

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,600
You've been keeping this secret for so many years.

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Why did you suddenly tell him?

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Why did you suddenly tell him?

96
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
Because...

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
Because I had to let my lady know

98
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
what kind of person his husband is.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,400
I didn't want to publicize the public.

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
But my lady

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
killed herself on the stage of Jin Lin.

102
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
I must reveal the true face of this official.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My lady and my lady will be fair.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
You really don't know?

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
It's because you told your lady

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,600
that she killed herself.

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
You said I didn't agree.

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Is it true that she had to keep this secret?

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
This bracelet is good.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,600
But...

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What is the reason

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,200
for the two of them to be here?

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Why do we have to do this?

114
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
We just need to know

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
that there's a person who is a doctor.

116
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
He must be standing on our side.

117
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes.

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
He's standing on our side.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,600
What's the meaning of this?

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
What's the meaning of this?

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
There are many meanings.

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,000
First,

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Jin Guangyao is so cruel.

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Why did he leave

125
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,000
Sisi alone after killing more than 20 people?

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
Now that he has the witness,

127
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
what about the witness?

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
It's just that he's not showing up.

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Jin Guangyao was the one who escaped

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,800
from the prison and the prison

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
so he was able to escape one step at a time.

132
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
He was able to escape one step at a time.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Otherwise, he would have been a son of a long time.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
How could he have done this?

135
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
He was so cruel to Chifeng.

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Now that the Wu army is still there,

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm afraid that

138
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
we don't need any explanation.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Not only is he a brother,

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
but also a brother.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Jin Guangyao was busy with cleaning

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
his father's private life a few years ago.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He was afraid that someone would kill him

144
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
and take his place.

145
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
It seems that

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
the situation is good.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,800
If he hadn't been locked up and be kicked back,

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
maybe he would have been the same as the others.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Because of all the reasons.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
Jin Zi is so cruel to him.

151
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,000
He must have had a relationship with him.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Don't forget.

153
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
There's also Xue Yang.

154
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Didn't Xue Yang escape that year?

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
It must have something to do with Jin Guangyao.

156
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,200
Yes.

157
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
The Tiger Manor that was controlled by the puppet

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
was also made by Xue Yang.

159
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,400
It seems that

160
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
this Jin Mo Ren

161
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
killed his father, brother, son,

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
and the master.

163
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
It's really scary.

164
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Today is also the same.

165
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
I think that Jin Guangyao

166
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
is seeing that

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
all the people in the family

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
are growing up and becoming stronger.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
He is very dangerous.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So he is also afraid that

171
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
he would be like the Qishan Wen Shi

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
who was pushed back and be kicked back.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's why he is so stubborn.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
He wants to set up a trap

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,600
and call us to attack.

176
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Since that's the case,

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,800
let's let him

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,400
be the most afraid one

179
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
and try it.

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
How about we attack the Jinling stage?

181
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Yes.

182
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Jin Guangyao.

183
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Jin Guangyao.

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Jin Guangyao.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
Jin Guangyao.

186
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Jin Guangyao.

187
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Jin Guangyao.

188
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,000
Jin Guangyao.

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,800
Jin Guangyao.

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Jin Guangyao.

191
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
Jin Guangyao.

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Jin Guangyao.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Before today,

194
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
this terrible person

195
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,000
is still a face of a dog.

196
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Jin Guangyao.

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
I didn't expect that

198
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
people would be shouting

199
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
before the day.

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Jin Guangyao.

201
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Jin Guangyao.

202
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,600
Jin Guangyao.

203
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
Mr. Gui.

204
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Mr. Gui.

205
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Mr. Gui.

206
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,600
Jin Guangyao has a silver tiger suit.

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,600
You have to take care of it.

208
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Not bad.

209
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,400
No one can

210
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
get the old man's clothes.

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Now Jin Guangyao

212
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
is really the one who kicked him.

213
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Jin Guangyao.

215
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Jin Guangyao.

216
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Jin Guangyao.

217
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Jin Guangyao.

218
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Jin Guangyao.

219
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,200
Jin Guangyao.

220
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Gu Yang Hui.

221
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,200
Lan Zhan, what do you think?

222
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
The person who sent the letter is Mingliu.

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Who wrote the letter?

224
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
First, he should think about

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
persuading him to testify.

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Then, he should close the door

227
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
and give the case to Qiansu.

228
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
At this time,

229
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
he should be the one who

230
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,200
made Jin Guangyao's ugly princess.

231
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Every step of this person

232
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
is deep in thought.

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
He is in the city.

234
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm afraid he is not under Jin Guangyao.

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I guess

236
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
this person is the man

237
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,600
who is responsible for

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
finding the Black Man of Chifeng Village.

239
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
There is no evidence.

240
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,600
He is a man who is a friend of the enemy.

241
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
How is his motive?

242
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
It's hard to judge.

243
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
But Jin Guangyao is sure that

244
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
he will be in trouble

245
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
if he goes to the big city.

246
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
I will send the letter to the brother immediately.

247
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Please be careful.

248
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
What's wrong?

249
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Nothing.

250
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
It's the Chifeng Village of Jiangsu.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you want to go in?

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No.

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Uncle Jiang,

255
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Mrs. Yu,

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Sister-in-law.

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's me.

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm here to disturb you.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I used to

260
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,000
have a long class here.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
Mrs. Yu punished me

262
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,600
in three days.

263
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Lv Erwen

264
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
has sent his wife to the capital.

265
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
How can he be so kind?

266
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,800
But all these years,

267
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I've never seen a second woman

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
so violent like Mrs. Yu.

269
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,280
She made me

270
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
feel guilty because of a small thing.

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm guilty.

272
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
Do you want to tell the suitcase in Jiangsu?

273
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I don't know.

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
At least not now.

275
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
After all, you're my brothers.

276
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,200
The complicity between us

277
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
and Jiangsu is allons,

278
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,700
and theirs is finale.

279
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
The thing that's changes

280
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,160
is you have a long chance to stay

281
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
in Chenghu Area and travel the city Ngergyong Lane.

282
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,560
Do you think

283
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
It's not that easy to get rid of.

284
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Besides,

285
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I created this Eagle Tiger Manor.

286
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
No matter if there's gold or silver,

287
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
it can't change this reality.

288
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Wei Wuxian.

289
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
You really don't treat yourself as an outsider.

290
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
You can come and go if you want.

291
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
You can bring people with you.

292
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Do you remember who said this?

293
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
I didn't bring Han Guangjun

294
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
to the other secret place of Lotus Wood.

295
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
I just brought him here to get some incense.

296
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
To worship Uncle Jiang and Mrs. Yu.

297
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
We'll leave now.

298
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
You should kneel down to them.

299
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
You should kneel down in front of them,

300
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
and see them,

301
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
and see them in peace.

302
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Mr. Jiang, please pay attention to the words.

303
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
I pay attention?

304
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I think someone needs to pay attention to the words.

305
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Mr. Jiang,

306
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
you've been kicked out by my sister-in-law.

307
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
What are you doing here?

308
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Come in and face my parents,

309
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
and face my sister-in-law.

310
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Uncle Jiang.

311
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Lan Zhan, let's go.

312
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
The sooner you leave, the better.

313
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Don't let me see

314
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
those people who are so messy.

315
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
They appear in front of my Wang Qin.

316
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Mr. Jiang,

317
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
if you want to be scolded,

318
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
then you should scold me.

319
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Don't bring others up.

320
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I have to do something good to him.

321
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Wei Buxian,

322
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
you're so generous.

323
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Then I'll remind you.

324
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Back then,

325
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
you were a hero.

326
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
You saved Mr. Lan'er.

327
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
The whole Lotus Wood,

328
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
and my parents were buried for you.

329
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
That's not enough.

330
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
You have to save Lin Wenshi.

331
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
You're the one who saved her.

332
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
You have to save Lin Wenshi.

334
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
You're so generous.

335
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
You're so generous.

336
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
You're so generous.

337
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
You're so generous.

338
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
You brought these two

339
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
to the Lotus Wood.

340
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
You asked your General Gui

341
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
to come to our house

342
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
and destroy it.

343
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
You asked Mr. Lan'er

344
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
to come to our house

345
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
and bury me.

346
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
You asked them to find me.

347
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Mr. Lan'er,

348
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
you really made me look down on you.

349
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Mr. Lan'er is a good man.

350
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
He's been a good man for years.

351
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
He even has nothing to do

352
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
with the old man.

353
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
You're so generous.

354
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Your brother is so generous.

355
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Jiang Wan'in!

356
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Apologize to me.

357
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Apologize?

358
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Why?

359
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
You've insulted

360
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
your great love for me?

361
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Are you done?

362
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
You're done?

363
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I'm not done.

364
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Are you afraid of me?

365
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
I'm not afraid of you.

366
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I'm afraid of the old man.

367
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm afraid of you.

368
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm afraid of the old man.

369
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
I'm afraid of you.

370
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
I'm afraid of the old man.

371
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm afraid of you.

372
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Wei Ying.

373
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Lan Zhan,

374
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
let's go.

375
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay.

376
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Stop!

377
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
What?

378
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
You were so mean just now.

379
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
You want to fight?

380
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Fight!

381
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Let go.

382
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
What's wrong?

383
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Why are you in your room?

384
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I want to do business with you.

385
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Are you doing it to值 your life?

386
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Do you see this?

387
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
It's all my fault.

388
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Don't ask me to get back here.

389
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
It's all my fault.

390
00:17:33,560 --> 00:18:03,160
come.

391
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
How dare you!

392
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
What do you want?

393
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Pull it out.

394
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I'm warning you.

395
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
If you don't want to be misunderstood,

396
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,520
you must break your bridge

397
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
and get out of the earth.

398
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Get out!

399
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Do it!

400
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Pull it out!

401
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
What else?

402
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:43,040
The seal is removed.

403
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
The seal is not removed.

404
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Until now,

405
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
it's still the seal.

406
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
If you take it back

407
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
and get rid of it,

408
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
you can't get it out

409
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,040
no matter who you get.

410
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Why?

411
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Why can I get it out?

412
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Because this ring

413
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
has recognized you as Mr. Wei.

414
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
What does it mean?

415
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Why is it me?

416
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Because the golden belt

417
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
that is moving in your body

418
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
is his.

419
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Sister,

420
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
he won't wake up, right?

421
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
No.

422
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
He won't.

423
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
He won't wake up.

424
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
He won't.

425
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Get out.

426
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Get out.

427
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
What are you talking about?

428
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
I'm not talking nonsense.

429
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Shut up!

430
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
My golden belt.

431
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
My golden belt.

432
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm the one who fixed it for you.

433
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
How do you know?

434
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
He even said that to you?

435
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
No.

436
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Mr. Wei has never

437
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
ever lied to anyone.

438
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
I saw it tonight.

439
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Nonsense!

440
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
You're here.

441
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
How could you be here?

442
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
You're here.

443
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
How could you be here?

444
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
I was the only one

445
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
who was on the mountain.

446
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
You couldn't have followed me.

447
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
I didn't follow you.

448
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Lie!

449
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Then listen to me.

450
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Am I lying?

451
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
When you were on the mountain,

452
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
there was a black cloth on your eyes.

453
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
It had a long comb in it.

454
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
When you arrived at the mountain,

455
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
you passed a stone forest.

456
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
You were about to be killed

457
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
by a stone mountain.

458
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
You heard the bell.

459
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
The bell rang out

460
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
like a bird.

461
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
You held the ring

462
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
and held it in your hand.

463
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Like a sword.

464
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
When you stopped,

465
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
there was a sword.

466
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
It was on your heart.

467
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
You heard a woman's voice.

468
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
It was a sign of your presence.

469
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Who are you?

470
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
What's your name?

471
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm the disciple of the mountain-dweller.

472
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
The son of the mountain-dweller, Wei Ying,

473
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
came to see you.

474
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
You stopped the pace.

475
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
You looked nervous.

476
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
You were still excited.

477
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
The voice of the woman was low.

478
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Who are you?

479
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Why are you here?

480
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Answer me.

481
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Shut up!

482
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Answer me.

483
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,040
You are the son of the mountain-dweller, Wei Ying.

484
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
You said you were going to be killed by a family.

485
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
You said you were in a mess.

486
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
You also said you were killed by a bullet.

487
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
You asked the bamboo dragon to get the gold bullet.

488
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
That woman was asking you

489
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
about your parents' problems.

490
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
When you answered the last one,

491
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
you suddenly smelled a fragrance.

492
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Then you lost your sense of smell.

493
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
How did you know that?

494
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
How did you know that?

495
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Didn't I say that?

496
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I was there.

497
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
I didn't know I was there.

498
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
I was there, too.

499
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
It was not just me and him.

500
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
And my sister,

501
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Wenjing.

502
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
She was there, too.

503
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Chief Jiang,

504
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
do you really think

505
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
you are the place where the mountain-dweller was hiding?

506
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
That bamboo dragon

507
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
was the one who made the mountain.

508
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
No.

509
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
No.

510
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
No.

511
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
You are lying.

512
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Why did you hide it?

513
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Then why did my gold bullet

514
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
be repaired?

515
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Your gold bullet

516
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
was not repaired at all.

517
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
No.

518
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
No.

519
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Chief Jiang,

520
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
do you know

521
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
why you thought it was repaired?

522
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
It was because my sister

523
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,040
was the best doctor

524
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
and Wenjing.

525
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
She took the gold bullet

526
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
from Childe Wei

527
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
and gave it back to you.

528
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
You think

529
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
why she never used the bottle

530
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
after that?

531
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
It was because she was young and rich.

532
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
She really liked

533
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
the name Li Anli.

534
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
She just pulled her

535
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
long-haired tiger and told her

536
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
you didn't have a hair-cut

537
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
or a hair-cut.

538
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Because she didn't use it

539
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
even if she had a hair-cut.

540
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
She didn't have a gold bullet.

541
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
She didn't know the name.

542
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
She just pulled the sword

543
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
and couldn't hold on for long.

544
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Your sword.

545
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Wei Wuxian,

546
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
I can find it for you.

547
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Why didn't you use it today?

548
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
I told you I didn't want it.

549
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
In the future,

550
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
you can't use it

551
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
in this big market.

552
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
You said it would be used

553
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
for how long?

554
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
How long

555
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
did it take?

556
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
You even used the trick of

557
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
the ghost knife.

558
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
You thought

559
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
why did she suddenly

560
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
turn around and use the ghost knife?

561
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
She became a cold-hearted

562
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
ghost-ghost.

563
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
It was because she didn't have a gold bullet

564
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
and couldn't see the Li Clan.

565
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
It was because of this

566
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
that she really had no other way.

567
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Xiang Chang,

568
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
don't be so angry.

569
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
What's wrong?

570
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
What's wrong?

571
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
You drank too much.

572
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
Your spiritual power is gone.

573
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Look at you now.

574
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
You even said you wanted to help me

575
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
rebuild the Jiang clan.

576
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Don't come over.

577
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Xiang Chang,

578
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
there's only one chance.

579
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
You can't do this again.

580
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Xiang Chang,

581
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
don't be so angry.

582
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
You can't do this again.

583
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
You can't do this again.

584
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
You can't do this again.

585
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
You can't do this again.

586
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
You can't do this again.

587
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
You can't do this again.

588
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
You can't do this again.

589
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
You can't do this again.

590
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
You can't do this again.

591
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
You can't do this again.

592
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
You can't do this again.

593
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
You can't do this again.

594
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You can't do this again.

595
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
얼

596
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
This sword

597
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,700
when you go to the Police Station,

598
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
campus,

599
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,740
or to what place,

600
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,500
to call a friend.

601
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Look at them.

602
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Look at them.

603
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Can anyone pull it out?

604
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
You know it.

605
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Am I lying?

606
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Chief Jiang.

607
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
You are so hardworking.

608
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
You have been competing with others for the rest of your life.

609
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
But you never

610
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
can't compare to him.

611
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
No.

612
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
No.

613
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
No.

614
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
No.

615
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
You are all lying to me.

616
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Lying to me!

617
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Mr. Lan Er.

618
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Let's take Mr. Wei away.

619
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Mr. Lan Er.

620
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
What's the matter?

621
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I have to go to the toilet.

622
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm not going to go.

623
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm going to go to the toilet.

624
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Let's go.

625
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Let's go.

626
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Let's go.

627
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Let's go.

628
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Let's go.

629
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Let's go.

630
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Let's go.

631
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Let's go.

632
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
What's the matter?

633
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Please don't tell Mr. Wei for now.

634
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I've told him everything.

635
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Because he told me to tell him.

636
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
He told me to tell him.

637
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Although he knew it sooner or later.

638
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
But I...

639
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Don't worry.

640
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Thank you.

641
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
You were talking to us at the Golden Forest.

642
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I always remember.

643
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Thank you.

644
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Thank you for taking care of Ah Yue for so many years.

645
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,500
I thought that our family...

646
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
They all died.

647
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
One of them is gone.

648
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I didn't expect that Ah Yue...

649
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
He was still alive.

650
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
When he was 20 years old.

651
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,500
He was in the truth.

652
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
That day,

653
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I missed Yang Hui.

654
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I went to the Golden Forest to find Wei Ying.

655
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,500
I found Ah Yue.

656
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
He was hiding in the cave for too long.

657
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
He had a stroke and got sick.

658
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I know that he must have been sick.

659
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
He doesn't remember what happened before.

660
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I talked to him for a long time.

661
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
He kept telling me about you.

662
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,500
He told me about Mr. Wei.

663
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,500
He told me that he was sick.

664
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,500
He used to tell me about Mr. Wei.

665
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,500
He never told me about me.

666
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
You didn't tell him?

667
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Do you think he is really sick?

668
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
He is living well now.

669
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
He knows too much about other things.

670
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
He remembers too much.

671
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
He knows that he is not as good as he is now.

672
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
He should know sooner or later.

673
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Yes.

674
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,500
He should know sooner or later.

675
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Just like Mr. Wei and President Jiang.

676
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
If he knows sooner or later.

677
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,500
He should never hide from President Jiang for his whole life.

678
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Does it hurt?

679
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
What?

680
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Does it hurt?

681
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,500
If I say it doesn't hurt.

682
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Mr. Lan, you won't believe me, will you?

683
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I thought that Wen Qing would have a way.

684
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Before I went to the mountain.

685
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
My sister made the most of the medicine.

686
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
She wanted to reduce the pain of the bullet.

687
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
But she found out later.

688
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Those medicines were useless.

689
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Because if the bullet was thrown out.

690
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
And it was in the body.

691
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
If this person is in a drunk state.

692
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Then the bullet will be affected.

693
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
It is hard to guarantee that it will not be scattered.

694
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
When will it be scattered?

695
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
So.

696
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,500
So the person who is in a daze.

697
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
He should wake up all the time.

698
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
You must wake up.

699
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
See the golden egg of the forest.

700
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
It is out of the body.

701
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Feel the power of the chest.

702
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
The calmness of the chest.

703
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Calmness.

704
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Calmness.

705
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Until it becomes a dead water.

706
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
No more waves.

707
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Always awake?

708
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Two nights and one day.

709
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Always awake.

710
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
At that time.

711
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
You didn't have the confidence.

712
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
About five times.

713
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Five times.

714
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
After all.

715
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
No one has ever tried this kind of change.

716
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
It is impossible for someone to be willing.

717
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
To give their golden egg to others.

718
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Because if so.

719
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
It is equivalent to yourself.

720
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Will become a person.

721
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Never get on the top.

722
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
No one can get on the bottom.

723
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
So.

724
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
When Mr. Wei asked for sister.

725
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
My sister was unwilling at first.

726
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
But Mr. Wei kept on fighting.

727
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Said that it would be fine if it was five times.

728
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Half by half.

729
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Even if it didn't work.

730
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
He didn't have a way to go.

731
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
But.

732
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
The person like Mr. Jiang.

733
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
He is too strong.

734
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
He cares about the gain.

735
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
The cultivation is his life.

736
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
If Mr. Jiang.

737
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Can only be a normal person.

738
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Then.

739
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,500
He will be finished in this life.

740
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Why did you go to the sword.

741
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
To repair the soil.

742
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
What do you want to do?

743
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
To repair the shoes.

744
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Finally pay the price.

745
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
The ancient king came.

746
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
No one can get away.

747
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
The dead will be damaged.

748
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
And the heart will be damaged.

749
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
How can I be damaged?

750
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
How can others know?

751
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Wei Wuxian.

752
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Wei Wuxian.

753
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Wei Wuxian.

754
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Lan Zhan.

755
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
How did we come out?

756
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
We fought for a while.

757
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I knew.

758
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Jiang Cheng didn't let me off easily.

759
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
This bastard.

760
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
He is so unreasonable.

761
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Lan Zhan.

762
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Don't put those words.

763
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
What Jiang Cheng said.

764
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
In your heart.

765
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
This bastard.

766
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
He is so kind.

767
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
He is so unreasonable.

768
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
He is so unreasonable.

769
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
He is so generous.

770
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
He is so generous.

771
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
As long as he can make others feel bad.

772
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
He can say anything.

773
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
For so many years.

774
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
He has never grown up.

775
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
So.

776
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Don't put it in your heart.

777
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
We are...

778
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Sir.

779
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
We are in Lotus Lake.

780
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I know.

781
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
When I was a kid.

782
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
I often came here to play with my senior sister.

783
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Ah Xian.

784
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Come. Eat lotus seeds.

785
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Senior sister.

786
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Sir.

787
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Sir.

788
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Sir.

789
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Only the three of us.

790
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Are the closest.

791
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Senior sister.

792
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
I am hungry.

793
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Why are you still like a child?

794
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Sir.

795
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
What's wrong?

796
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I am hungry.

797
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Lan Zhan.

798
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Wen Ning.

799
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
You are here at the right time.

800
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Wei Ying.

801
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
What's wrong?

802
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Is there a master in this lotus pond?

803
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Of course not.

804
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,500
I heard that there is a master in this lotus pond.

805
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Hanguang Jun.

806
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
You are so familiar.

807
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
I don't know.

808
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Okay.

809
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Wen Ning.

810
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Let's go.

811
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I am sorry.

812
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
I am sorry.

813
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I am sorry.

814
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
The golden arrow is a message.

815
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
What's wrong?

816
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
What did you say?

817
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Jin Guangyao is coming to Yunmeng.

818
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Why is he not in Lanling's golden arrow?

819
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Why is he coming to Yunmeng?

820
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
I am not sure.

821
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
You are the master.

822
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
I am not sure.

823
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Are you worried that Jin Guangyao will be in trouble?

824
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
But Jin Guangyao's behavior

825
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
is really impossible to predict.

826
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Yunmeng.

827
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Yunping City.

828
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I know.

829
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Lan Zhan.

830
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
I know.

831
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
What do you know?

832
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I know where Jin Guangyao is going.

833
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Where?

834
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Yunping City.

835
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Yunping City.

836
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
That's right.

837
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Lan Zhan.

838
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Do you remember?

839
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
I told you before.

840
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
In the secret room of Fangfei Palace,

841
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,500
we put the head of Chi Fengsun together.

842
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
In addition to the case of the explosion,

843
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
there is also a room and a ground.

844
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,500
And this place is in Yunping City.

845
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
What is this place?

846
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I don't know.

847
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
But I remember the address.

848
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Lanling City is a big city.

849
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
If this place

850
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
is not the place where Jin Guangyao is the most important,

851
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,500
it is absolutely impossible to put the head of Chi Fengsun together.

852
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
So I believe that

853
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
if Jin Guangyao comes to Yunmeng,

854
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,500
then he must have gone to Yunping City.

855
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Wen Ning.

856
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Yunping City.

857
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Miss.

858
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Excuse me.

859
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Is this Yunping City?

860
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
This is Yunping City.

861
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Thank you.

862
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
It's okay.

863
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Lan Zhan.

864
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
We are here.

865
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Let's go to the city first.

866
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Let's go and see.

867
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Master.

868
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
Master.

869
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Master.

870
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Hey, don't bully him.

871
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Master.

872
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Lan Zhan.

873
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
You still keep it?

874
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,500
You can't hide it.

875
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Master.

876
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
What?

877
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,500
Look, there are many butterflies.

878
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Butterflies?

879
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Hurry up.

880
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
There are many butterflies.

881
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
There are so many butterflies.

882
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
There are so many butterflies.

883
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,500
Master.

884
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Master.

885
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Master.

886
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Master.
