1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,200
I, a black cat

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I just got off theane.

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I just got off theane.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I just got off theane.

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,320
That's my AJ Pic

16
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
I never thought he got drunk

17
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
How Niantian could let them go

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,640
Yeah, really

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,000
It's impüal

20
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,720
If we let them go

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
It's too boring

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,120
Young master does not agree

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,240
White's look is so old

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,640
Alright, put it down

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,160
Let's go

26
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,480
The ceremony still would be away from you.

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,000
Sulia, go and rest.

28
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,320
I will be done here.

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Go.

30
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,120
It's only one hour left.

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,160
You can't come early.

32
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
I'll just stay here and stay.

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Mother.

34
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
I'll stay with him for a while.

35
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
No.

36
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll get you some food.

37
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll be right back.

38
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Mother.

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Shen.

40
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Shen.

41
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Shen.

42
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Shen.

43
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Wei Wuxian.

44
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Someone.

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Someone.

46
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Wei Wuxian has left.

47
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Someone.

48
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Wei Wuxian.

49
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Get him.

50
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Get him.

51
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Get him.

52
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Thank you.

53
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Thank you.

54
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
It's...

55
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Thank you.

56
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Get up.

57
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Get up.

58
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Wuxian.

61
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Get up.

63
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Get up.

64
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Get up.

67
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Get up.

68
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I can only...

69
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Get up.

70
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
The Golden Clan has a saying.

71
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
The Four Masters will hold a ceremony in the night sky.

72
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
The Wen clan will be in the dark for three days.

73
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
The guard will be back to the capital.

74
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
The day will come.

75
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
General Gui is so cruel.

76
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
He said he was drunk.

77
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
He was suddenly crazy.

78
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
He opened the gate at the Golden Bell Tower.

79
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Thank God I wasn't there that day.

80
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Wei Wuxian is really a dog.

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Wei Ying is so true.

82
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
She can't control her.

83
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
She can't control her.

84
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
She can't even train her dog.

85
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
She can't train her dog properly.

86
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
She will be in trouble one day.

87
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I think it's not far from here.

88
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Lan Lin is so unlucky.

89
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
It's not like it's not possible.

90
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
On the Qiong Qi Road,

91
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
the thirty-some people who killed them

92
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
were all from their family.

93
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
They were only here to fight for peace.

94
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Luckily, General Gui was finally destroyed.

95
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Otherwise, I didn't expect that

96
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
he would be out all day.

97
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
He couldn't sleep well.

98
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,160
That's how he should be.

99
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
General Gui and his sister

100
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
were already burned to ashes.

101
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I think Wuxian should know that.

102
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
The other family members have been released.

103
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
The actual meeting tonight

104
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
is to discuss the counter-measures

105
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
of Wei Wuxian.

106
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
It's so cruel.

107
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
If he is sitting on the rock

108
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
with Wei Wuxian as his witness,

109
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
it's fine.

110
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
If he dares to come out and escape,

111
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
as long as he comes out,

112
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
he will be...

113
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
What's the matter?

114
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
How do you know this?

115
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
If there is nothing else,

116
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
please come down with me at ease.

117
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Don't worry, Hessen.

118
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I will fall into the world.

119
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:27,760
Hold on tight,

120
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Master the return of peace,

121
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Help!

122
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Help!

123
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Why didn't you say anything?

124
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
How are you going to protect me?

125
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Meiyang, if you really have the ability,

126
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
go to the Shanshan Assembly

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
and have a talk with the people.

128
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
You can't bully us

129
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
and have no ability to fight back.

130
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
What ability do you have?

131
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Don't kill me!

132
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Fight back?

133
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,760
I will surely honor you

134
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,760
when the first day is gone.

135
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
What kind of hatred do you have with me?

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
You can't even tolerate me.

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,760
But there is one thing you are right about.

138
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,760
There is a head of the family and a head of the master.

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,760
I really shouldn't waste my time with you.

140
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
I will not let you go.

141
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,760
I will not let you go.

142
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
I will not let you go.

143
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,760
I will not let you go.

144
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I will not let you go.

145
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,760
I will not let you go.

146
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,760
I will not let you go.

147
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,760
I will not let you go.

148
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,760
I will not let you go.

149
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,760
I will not let you go.

150
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,760
I will not let you go.

151
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I will not let you go.

152
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I will not let you go.

153
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,760
I will not let you go.

154
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I will not let you go.

155
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I will not let you go.

156
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
I will not let you go.

157
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I will not let you go.

158
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I will not let you go.

159
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I will not let you go.

160
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
I will not let you go.

161
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
I will not let you go.

162
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,760
I will not let you go.

163
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I will not let you go.

164
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I will not let you go.

165
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I will not let you go.

166
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,760
I will not let you go.

167
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,760
I will not let you go.

168
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,760
I will not let you go.

169
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I will not let you go.

170
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I will not let you go.

171
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I will not let you go.

172
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I will not let you go.

173
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,760
I will not let you go.

174
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
I will not let you go.

175
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I will not let you go.

176
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,760
You're not going to go any further.

177
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Don't you have to stand here?

178
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Yes.

179
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Thank you, sir.

180
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,760
The soul of the soul, Yuan Anxi.

181
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,760
The soul of the soul, Yuan Anxi.

182
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
The soul of the soul, Yuan Anxi.

183
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Wen Qing, Wen Ning.

184
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,760
The soul of the soul, Yu Nian.

185
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Fen Hui is here.

186
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Good! Good! Good!

187
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Good! Good! Good!

188
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Good! Good! Good!

189
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Good! Good! Well done!

190
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:37,760

191
00:15:37,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I know that you are hungry. They are hungry that we cannot run away, they said... Yeah, that's right. They are safe here only for holding a shootout. We will take a break, okay? I'm afraid they will be so hungry that we won't be able to stop running. We will find some prominent 10альala ihre from both rivers, and we will shoot them down too. Let me see if it ever getszy... All right, we will drink some hot water there. But we can't reach them, not to harm them.

192
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,880
This night...

193
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,800
In this Wenshe Fishing Fishing Company,

194
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,240
both of the villagers are the owners,

195
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,320
and tomorrow...

196
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,480
the AWKW's were

197
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,120
thebeliever!

198
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,480
Ha ha ha ha.

199
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,800
Wei Yongqian.

200
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,660
Wei Ying.

201
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,460
How dare you!

202
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,320
You would all be here!

203
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Why can't I appear here?

204
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Don't forget that I have 3,000 people in the battle of the day.

205
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
I have even selected 5,000 people.

206
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Besides, I appeared here because I want to save you.

207
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Tomorrow, you will have to go to the gate and kill me.

208
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
You are so arrogant!

209
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I am arrogant!

210
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Chief Nie, I have always been arrogant.

211
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Chief Qin, I have something to ask you.

212
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,320
As long as the two of you go to the Golden Bell Tower to apologize,

213
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
who will be the one to take over this matter?

214
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,320
But you said you wanted to kill me and Wen Shi.

215
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,320
And you are so arrogant. Who is it?

216
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
One horse, one horse.

217
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Wei Ying, Qiong Qi is going to kill me.

218
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,320
You killed more than 100 disciples in Lan Ling.

219
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
This is one horse.

220
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
You sent Wen Ning and Xing Xiong.

221
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
This is another horse.

222
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,320
Chief Qin, who is Qiong Qi going to kill?

223
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Who is the one to kill?

224
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Who is the one to kill?

225
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Who is the one to kill?

226
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Who is the one to take over the Golden Bell Tower?

227
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
And you said that

228
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
how did I act in the Golden Bell Tower

229
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,320
and send Wen Ning to the Golden Bell Tower?

230
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Wei Yongxian, even if the Golden Bell Tower is designed to kill you first,

231
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,320
you shouldn't have done such a big crime.

232
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
You killed so many people.

233
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
I understand.

234
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,320
If you want to kill me, you can not risk your life.

235
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
But I want to protect myself.

236
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
I have to risk my life.

237
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I can't hurt this person.

238
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
I can't hurt that person.

239
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
I have died.

240
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
You can attack me.

241
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
But I can't fight back.

242
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Right?

243
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
You are so arrogant.

244
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
You can attack me.

245
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
But I can't fight back.

246
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Right?

247
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Attack?

248
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,320
That Qiong Qi and Dao San Shi are all human beings.

249
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
It's innocent.

250
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
If you want to attack, why do you want to hurt them?

251
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
It's innocent to mess up the 11 Wen family.

252
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Why do you want to connect them?

253
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Wen Shi gave you a great favor.

254
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,320
You want to punish him?

255
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
You are so mean.

256
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Do you think you are a hero and a hero to the world?

257
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Do you think you are a hero to the world?

258
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Ren Qian Di,

259
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,320
you are not the one who has ruined the entire country.

260
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I have a question.

261
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
What kind of evidence do you have?

262
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
It means, I am the one who is the evil族.

263
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Then what evidence?

264
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
It means you are not the one who is the evil族.

265
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
What evidence?

266
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
It means you are not the evil族.

267
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
It's not you who made the statement!

268
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Then I'll ask again.

269
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Why didn't you make the statement?

270
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
You didn't prove it, didn't you?

271
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
You're the evil tribe, right?

272
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Me?

273
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,080
How could I be like you?

274
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,320
You're a fool, a fool, a fool!

275
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
You're the most suspicious!

276
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
You think we don't know?

277
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
You and Jin Zixun have been together for more than a year!

278
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Who is the one who hid the truth?

279
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
You're right.

280
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
I knew him a year ago.

281
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
But if I wanted to kill him,

282
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I could have killed him a year ago.

283
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
How could I leave him to this day?

284
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
His character...

285
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
I can't say it's been a year.

286
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I forgot it for three days.

287
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

288
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm a great man today.

289
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,240
I've never seen a evil man like you

290
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,840
who is shameless and rude.

291
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
You killed more than 30 people.

292
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,280
You even humiliated the Prime Minister.

293
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Do you have any sympathy and pity for me?

294
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Wenjing, you disappointed me!

295
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Now you'reiler, I always have such respect for you!

296
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
You said that you should be the silver mill staff!

297
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,120
It turns out that you're a great man now!

298
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,960
I'll kill you since then!

299
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
You said you admired me?

300
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Then why did I not see you when you admired me?

301
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
You jumped out of the cliff when I was shouting and shouting.

302
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Your eye is too blinded.

303
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
You said you and I were not good at each other.

304
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Your bad influence is not on the sky.

305
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
What is the effect on me?

306
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Your gift and your eye are so blinded.

307
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,640
How can you be so proud to take it out?

308
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
You are right.

309
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,640
You are right.

310
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
You are right.

311
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Brother!

312
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Brother!

313
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Brother!

314
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Brother!

315
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Brother!

316
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Wei Ying, you are so cruel!

317
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
What do you mean by cruel?

318
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
He dares to attack me?

319
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640
You should know what is the consequence of this?

320
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,640
You have already tried to fool me.

321
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,640
You should not expect me to be so generous.

322
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
You should not be so angry with him.

323
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I will not let him leave here alive today.

324
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Brother!

325
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
Brother!

326
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Brother!

327
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Brother!

328
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Brother!

329
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Brother!

330
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Master!

331
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
They attacked us!

332
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,640
It seems that the master still remembers us.

333
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Master!

334
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Master!

335
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Master!

336
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Master!

337
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Master!

338
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Wang Ji!

339
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,640
Lan Zhan, you are here.

340
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,640
You should have known that Qing Xin Yin did not use me.

341
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Lan Zhan, I knew that we would have to kill each other one day.

342
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Master!

343
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Master!

344
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Master!

345
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Master!

346
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Master!

347
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Master!

348
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Master!

349
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Master!

350
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Master!

351
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Master!

352
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Master!

353
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Master!

354
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Master!

355
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Master!

356
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Master!

357
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Master!

358
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Master!

359
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Master!

360
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Master!

361
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640

362
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640

363
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Master!

364
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Master!

365
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Master!

366
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Master!

367
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Master!

368
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640

373
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,640
The nightingale is around here.

374
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,660
Do you see everything?

375
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,760
You know everything, right?

376
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Master, do you see nothing?

377
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,740
Master, our dearest Bi Ma nomination was completed.

378
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,740
Tony, will you give a speech?

379
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:17,740

Lan Zhan

382
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,980
Do you think I still have other ways to go?

383
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
Shijie.

384
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980

00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
I'm here to save my mother.

398
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
I'm going to kill her.

399
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
Wei Wuxian.

432
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Let her go.

433
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Get out.

434
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Get out.

435
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
Don't touch her.

437
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980

Stop.

447
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
I said you can control it.

448
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
Didn't you say it's okay?

449
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
I didn't.

450
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
I didn't know.

451
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,980
I didn't want to hurt you.

452
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
Why can't I control it?

453
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
I can't control it.

454
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,980
It's okay.

455
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,980
It's just a dream.

456
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,980
I don't know why I can't control it.

457
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
Why can't I control it?

458
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Ah Xian.

459
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980

My thanks.

464
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,980
Why did you run away so fast?

465
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
I can't even see you.

466
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Let me see you again.

467
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,980
Let me tell you a story.

468
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
I want to tell you.

469
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,980

472
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,980
Wuxian.

473
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
I want to kill Wei Wuxian.

474
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
I want to avenge my brother.

475
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
I didn't want to kill him.

476
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
Sister.

477
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,980
Wuxian.

478
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,980
You killed him.

479
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
It's not my fault.

480
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
Wuxian.

481
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
Wuxian.

482
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Wuxian.

483
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,980
Wuxian.

484
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
Wuxian.

485
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,980
Wuxian.
