00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Episode 1

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Look at you.

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're so good at singing and dancing.

4
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't have any strength.

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How can you take the time to sing?

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You have to practice hard.

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Especially your master.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's the master of culture,

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the master of the martial arts,

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you know?

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Jiang Cheng, you're here.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's take a look.

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm here to send you a bow.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please go to Baicheng Mountain

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to attend the ceremony.

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're so good at

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
sending bow to the emperor.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're so good at the ceremony.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It seems that

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
our Yunmeng's family is really good.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is what my mother meant.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She really hopes that Miss Jiang

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
can go to Baicheng Mountain

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to attend the ceremony.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
unevenly and quickly.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
As long as you're here.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll wear all the ties.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sure you don't need to

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
show that you're wow.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll come back and pass

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
on the скins.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay?

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's such a pity in nature.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Look,

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the telephone debt,

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,240
and tiniets in our hmm.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Sect Leader

38
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,480
Brother Jhin, how are you

39
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,780
We areICK

40
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,040
Brother Jin.

41
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,780
Did you listened to it?

42
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Please.

43
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,060
What are you looking at?

44
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
Is it nice?

45
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,260
What's up?

46
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
You still have something to do?

47
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
By the way, young master,

48
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,740
I came here to ask you for a favor.

49
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,940
On the day of the war,

50
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,740
I went to find the Yin Iron for you and Mr. Lan.

51
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,020
I also tied up the Xueyang Mount to the Buking Mountain.

52
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,060
Now, three pieces of broken pieces have been destroyed.

53
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,620
Only one piece left.

54
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Mr. Wei, where are you?

55
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,020
I don't know why you came to ask me this.

56
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,300
I asked you to answer the question.

57
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Why did you ask so much?

58
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,340
Young master Qin is so close to you.

59
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,540
You...

60
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
Young master,

61
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I have a favor to ask you.

62
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Please.

63
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
Young master Wei,

64
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
I have a favor to ask you.

65
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Please.

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
And,

67
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
on the day of the war,

68
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
the Yin Tiger Manor has attacked many of our men.

69
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I also hope that

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
on the Buking Mountain,

71
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
Mr. Wei can take out the Yin Tiger Manor

72
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
and give the injured men a lesson.

73
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
Mr. Wei,

74
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
I have a favor to ask you.

75
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Please.

76
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Please.

77
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
Please.

78
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Please.

79
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Please.

80
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Please.

81
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Please.

82
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Please.

83
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
Please.

84
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Please.

85
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Please.

86
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
Please.

87
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Please.

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Please.

89
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Please.

90
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Please.

91
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Please.

92
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Please.

93
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,260
Please.

94
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Please.

95
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Please.

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Please.

97
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Please.

98
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
Please.

99
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
Please.

100
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Please.

101
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
Please.

102
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
Please.

103
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Please.

104
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Please.

105
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Please.

106
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Please.

107
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Please.

108
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
I think everybody knows the rules.

109
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
Let me repeat it.

110
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,260
This board is a key to entering the mountain.

111
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,260
The visitors of the mountain must set up a set of rules

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
to get the right entrance.

113
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
The sword has seven powers.

114
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
The seven channels are different.

115
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,260
The arrow is closer to the red heart.

116
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
The channels are more convenient.

117
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,260
But this year, we have designed a special part for everyone.

118
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
I wish you all the best.

119
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Let's go.

120
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
Hurry up.

121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Hurry up.

122
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,260
Let's go.

123
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
Someone is blocking the board.

124
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,260
The arrow board will be more difficult to set up.

125
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,260
This is more challenging for everyone.

126
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
What's this?

127
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

128
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

129
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

130
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

131
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

132
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

133
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

134
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

135
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

136
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
The arrow board is a key to entering the mountain.

137
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Let's go.

138
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Let's go.

139
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Who else is not convinced?

140
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
Just come and challenge.

141
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,260
I want to see who else is better than me.

142
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Who else?

143
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
Anzhai, help me.

144
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
What is it?

145
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
I want to see you.

146
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
Anzhai

147
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Anzhai

148
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Anzhai

149
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Good!

150
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Good!

151
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
Good!

152
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Good!

153
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Good!

154
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Good!

155
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Good!

156
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Good!

157
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,260
This opening ring is just for everyone to be warm and happy.

158
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,260
Of course, everyone is supposed to be in the field.

159
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,260
How about this?

160
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,260
Why don't we cancel this ceremony this time?

161
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Please go directly to the field.

162
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
It was just an opening ring.

163
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
It's just for these useless things.

164
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
You were just blinded.

165
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
You are really capable.

166
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,260
You are blinded by your whole practice.

167
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,260
We will see each other on the mountain later.

168
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
We will win.

169
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Good!

170
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Go!

171
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,260
Go!

172
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,260
Go!

173
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
Go!

174
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Go!

175
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Go!

176
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
Go!

177
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Master!

178
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Master!

179
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Tell me, what is it?

180
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Just now, all the gold and silver were controlled by an arrow.

181
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
It was used to trap us in the net.

182
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,260
How could this be?

183
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
I told you not to do anything.

184
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
I will kill you.

185
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
I will kill you.

186
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
It's a set way.

187
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,260
I hope you don't do it because of your own fault.

188
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,260
And I will affect the people around you who really care about you.

189
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Master!

190
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
Lan Zhan,

191
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,260
I heard that you have been practicing your housework in the Cloud Recesses.

192
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
It's been a hard time.

193
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
I am good at playing the piano.

194
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,260
I can show you if it works.

195
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
Lan Wangji,

196
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
who am I?

197
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Can you not care about me?

198
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,260
Who do you think I am?

199
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,260
I used to treat you as my life's miracle.

200
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,260
Now I know.

201
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
I am a little worried about you.

202
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
I am not worried about you.

203
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
I am worried about you.

204
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
I am worried about you.

205
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,260
I am worried about you.

206
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
I am worried about you.

207
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,260
I am worried about you.

208
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,260
I am worried about you.

209
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
I am worried about you.

210
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,260
I am worried about you.

211
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
I am worried about you.

212
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I am worried about you.

213
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
I am worried about you.

214
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,260
I am worried about you.

215
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,260
I am worried about you.

216
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,260
I knew that Mrs. Jin would let you and that flower-dry man

217
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,260
meet alone.

218
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
This place is not safe.

219
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
This is the old place that Liang Ren-shef left.

220
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
What?

221
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
It's a monster that came from the south.

222
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
It's just that when you meet someone,

223
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
it will suddenly come out.

224
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
Then I will compare it with you.

225
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
If it's longer than you,

226
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
you will be swallowed by it.

227
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
It looks like a monster.

228
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
It's just that when you meet someone,

229
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
you will suddenly come out.

230
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
Then I will compare it with you.

231
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,260
If it's longer than you,

232
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,260
you will be swallowed by it.

233
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
It looks scary.

234
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
There is nothing wrong with it.

235
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Liang Ren-shef has a skin on his face.

236
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
It should be convenient.

237
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
It's hard for ordinary people to deal with it.

238
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
But this time,

239
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
all the hunting and hunting of the Bajia

240
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
is not going well.

241
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
We can't hurt the people in Nanling.

242
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,260
It's best not to hurt people.

243
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
Not hurt people?

244
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
What does it mean not to hurt people?

245
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
If you come to our private hunting and hunting of Nanling,

246
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,260
you can see many hunting that you have never seen before.

247
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
I have time next month.

248
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
I can take you there.

249
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Thank you for your kindness.

250
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
But...

251
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,260
there is no need to bother.

252
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Why?

253
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,260
You don't like hunting?

254
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,260
Then why did you agree to come here this time?

255
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
I...

256
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
I...

257
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
I...

258
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
You don't like hunting?

259
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Or you don't like being with me?

260
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
No.

261
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
No.

262
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
I...

263
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Don't be afraid.

264
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
You are not sorry.

266
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
Whatever you think,

267
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
I didn't invite you here this time anyway.

268
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I don't want to go.

269
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Shameless.

270
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
I'm afraid

271
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,260
that if I let the world know her true face,

272
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
I will never come back to her again.

273
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Sorry.

274
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Stop.

275
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
I...

276
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
Lu Wuxian.

277
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
Why are you here again?

278
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
I want to ask you.

279
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
Why are you here again?

280
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Are you crazy?

281
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
What do you mean by that?

282
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
I'm just hitting you.

283
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Why do you want to catch my sister?

284
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
I don't want to catch her.

285
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Do you want her to run around alone in the mountains?

286
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Lord Han Guang?

287
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
What's going on?

288
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Zi Xuan.

289
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,260
Did that Wei Zi

290
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
find you in trouble again?

291
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
Don't bother.

292
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Stop.

293
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
What?

294
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
You still want to fight?

295
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Wei Zi.

296
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
What do you mean?

297
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
You found Zi Xuan in trouble twice.

298
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Who are you?

299
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
You don't know who I am.

300
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
Why should I know who you are?

301
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
You...

302
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Mother.

303
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Wuxian.

304
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Why are you here?

305
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
You are too kind.

306
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Who said I came to see you?

307
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Han Li.

308
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Why do you look like this?

309
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Thank you, madam.

310
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,260
I'm fine.

311
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Are you going to be like this again?

312
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
No.

313
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
Zi Xuan.

314
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,260
Are you going to die?

315
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
How did you promise me

316
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
before you left?

317
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
I...

318
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I didn't care

319
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
what Madam Jin promised me before I left.

320
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
But from today on,

321
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
she and my senior sister

322
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
are on the same side

323
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
on the road to the heaven.

324
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Wei Wuxian.

325
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm your elder brother.

326
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,260
I'm your elder brother.

327
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Are you saying

328
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
that I'm too arrogant?

329
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm not against Madam Jin.

330
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
But you have been

331
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
so evil and arrogant

332
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
twice in your life.

333
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
If I can still bear

334
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
the loss of my life,

335
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
I'll go to the world.

336
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
What's wrong with being arrogant?

337
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
What's wrong with you?

338
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Today is a great day

339
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
for the Bai family.

340
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
You're very good at it.

341
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
You won the third city's prize

342
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
by yourself.

343
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Isn't that very good?

344
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
The third city's prize?

345
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
Lord Han Guang,

346
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
you still don't know

347
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
that we've been in the hunting field

348
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
for a long time.

349
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
We've found that

350
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
there's no hunting at all

351
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
in the hunting field.

352
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Yes.

353
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
We asked the face of

354
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
the official hunter

355
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
and we found out

356
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
that after half an hour

357
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,260
after the hunting,

358
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
a single enemy was sent

359
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
from the mountain.

360
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Then almost all the hunting

361
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,260
went on and on

362
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
and went to the camp

363
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,260
of the Yunmeng River

364
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
and went to the internet.

365
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Wei Wuxian.

366
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
You didn't care about others

367
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
but yourself.

368
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Don't you

369
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
have enough ambition?

370
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Isn't this what you

371
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
said in the capital?

372
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
You're good at hunting

373
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
and you're good at everything.

374
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Why are you not convinced now?

375
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
You're just a devil.

376
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
You're not really good

377
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
at your own business.

378
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
You're just a two-headed man.

379
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
How can you be so good at this?

380
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I didn't do anything

381
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,260
to make you jealous.

382
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Why don't you?

383
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Why don't you

384
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
blow two flute strings

385
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
and see

386
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
if there's anything

387
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
to leave with you?

388
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,260
You're a devil.

389
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
You're worse than a devil.

390
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
How much?

391
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
Fine.

392
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
Since I don't know

393
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
what real power is,

394
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
please take it out

395
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
and win me over.

396
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Let me see.

397
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
But

398
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
it's not your fault

399
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,260
that you didn't do anything wrong.

400
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Mr. Wei

401
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,260
has broken the rules

402
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
twice.

403
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Last time,

404
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
the flower industry

405
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
and the hunting and hunting

406
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,260
were not in line.

407
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
Such a big place

408
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
doesn't even

409
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
have a half-point margin.

410
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Where did you

411
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
put

412
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
those people

413
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
who are like you

414
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
to me?

415
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
Lan Zhan,

416
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
I forgot to say thank you.

417
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,260
I just blocked one.

418
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Thank you.

419
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Thank you.

420
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
The teaching of the Yunmeng Jiang family

421
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
is just like that.

422
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
How dare you

423
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
give me a devil's knife?

424
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
Zi Xin.

425
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,260
The teaching of the devil's knife?

426
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Wei Yun.

427
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
Didn't you want to know

428
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
why I don't deserve to see you?

429
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
It's okay to tell you.

430
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Because I, Wei Wuxian,

431
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
don't deserve to see you.

432
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,260
But with the devil's knife in your mouth,

433
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,260
you can also

434
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,260
make up for it

435
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
and let everyone

436
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
forget about me.

437
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,260
Wei Wuxian.

438
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,260
You are just a son of a prostitute.

439
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Don't be too crazy.

440
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Wei Yun,

441
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
I'm here.

442
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Wei Yun,

443
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
I'm here.

444
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Ah Xi.

445
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Ah Xi.

446
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Stand behind me.

447
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Shi Jin.

448
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Ah Li.

449
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,260
Don't be angry.

450
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,260
They will deal with their own matters.

451
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,260
Mr. Jin.

452
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I heard what you said.

453
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Shi Ah Xian

454
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
took the three-story

455
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
hunting ground

456
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
by himself.

457
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
He is not a good person.

458
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
He is too arrogant.

459
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,260
I...

460
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
I never heard

461
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
about such a thing.

462
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
I never heard

463
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
about such a thing.

464
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I think

465
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
it's really a problem

466
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
for everyone.

467
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
I'll take her

468
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
to apologize to everyone.

469
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Shi Jin.

470
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
Miss Jiang

471
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
is really smart

472
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
and has a great sense of humor.

473
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
What your junior did

474
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
was really big.

475
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
It really

476
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
caused a lot of trouble.

477
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
But

478
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
it seems that

479
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Miss Jiang

480
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
and the Chief Jiang

481
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
are not

482
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
to blame.

483
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
After all,

484
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Yun Meng Jiang Shi

485
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
and Lan Ling Jin Shi

486
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
were originally

487
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
in the same family.

488
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
However,

489
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
I have never participated in the hunting ground.

490
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
But I do know

491
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
that the ancient gold

492
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
has been used for hunting.

493
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
There has never been

494
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
a rule that

495
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
it is not allowed to hunt alone.

496
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
You just said

497
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
that Xian doesn't follow the rules.

498
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
What is the rule

499
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
that he doesn't follow?

500
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Miss Jiang

501
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
you are wrong about this.

502
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Although some rules

503
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
are not written out,

504
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
everyone knows

505
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
clearly

506
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
and

507
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
well.

508
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
And they are well respected.

509
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
That's right.

510
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
There are many hunting ground

511
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
in the hunting ground.

512
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260
How many people have participated in the hunting ground?

513
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Five thousand people.

514
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
They were originally

515
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
in the same family.

516
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
He

517
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
took away so many hunting ground

518
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
alone.

519
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
What should we do?

520
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
It's not his fault

521
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
that others can't hunt.

522
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,260
The hunting ground is only about strength.

523
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Xian uses the method

524
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
although it is different from others.

525
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,260
But it is also the ability

526
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
he trained himself.

527
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
It can't be

528
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,260
because of the hunting ground

529
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,260
that the others don't like.

530
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
It means that he is a evil.

531
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,260
Besides,

532
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,260
it's a threat.

533
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Why did you say that?

534
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
Xian is my brother

535
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
in the Jiang clan.

536
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Since I was little,

537
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,260
I grew up with my brother.

538
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
I was a good friend.

539
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,260
You asked for my son

540
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
from the family.

541
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,260
I said I couldn't accept it.

542
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
So...

543
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
I also hope that

544
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Mr. Jin Zixun

545
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
can apologize

546
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
to my Wei Wuxian

547
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,260
in the Jiang clan.

548
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Hanlin,

549
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
it's a small matter.

550
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Don't be angry.

551
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Mrs. Jin,

552
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Xian is my brother.

553
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
He is just a person

554
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
who is not a small matter

555
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,260
because he is a person

556
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
who is just a person.

557
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Zixun,

558
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
did you hear that?

559
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Uncle.

560
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Xiong Cheng.

561
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Don't you remember?

562
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Why are you here?

563
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
Everyone,

564
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
what happened here?

565
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
What happened?

566
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
You are still laughing.

567
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
How can you still laugh?

568
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Look at the mess you made.

569
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,260
You are useless.

570
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
Mother,

571
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,260
what happened?

572
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
What did you say?

573
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
What's wrong?

574
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Can't you see?

575
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
You know how to check the color of the eyes.

576
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,260
The whole Mount Baifeng is gone.

577
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
One-third of the hunting ground

578
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
is gone.

579
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
You let us have more than 5,000 people.

580
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
What else are you hunting?

581
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,260
The Lianfang Sect has started to

582
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,260
expand the hunting ground

583
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
and the area.

584
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,260
Please don't be so anxious.

585
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,260
This hunting is a mess.

586
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Forget it.

587
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
I'm going out.

588
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,060
Zixun,

589
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
I've made arrangements.

590
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,260
I'll wait for half an hour.

591
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Mr. Jin.

592
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
Mr. Jin,

593
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
you don't have to.

594
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
This hunting

595
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
is not fair.

596
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,260
What else do I have to do?

597
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
I'll pay for it.

598
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Mr. Jin.

599
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Mr. Jin.

600
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
Mrs. Jin,

601
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
I've caused you trouble this time.

602
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
Li,

603
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
what trouble do you have to tell me?

604
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
That guy made you angry.

605
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
If you're not happy,

606
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
I'll do it for you.

607
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
No need.

608
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
Mrs. Jin,

609
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
I'll go back first.

610
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Don't.

611
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Come back to the hunting ground with me.

612
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
I'll send you off.

613
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Zixun.

614
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
No, no need to trouble me.

615
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
I...

616
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
I'll let Wei Wuxian send me off.

617
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Li,

618
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
you and Wei Wuxian

619
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,260
are always alone.

620
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Isn't that good?

621
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
A-Xian is my brother.

622
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Li,

623
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
your mother is my good friend.

624
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Don't blame her for being drunk.

625
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Wei Wuxian and you

626
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,260
are no longer kids.

627
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
When we're alone,

628
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,260
we'll be told lies.

629
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Besides,

630
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
that guy is too angry.

631
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
He might do something wrong.

632
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
I suggest you

633
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
stay away from him.

634
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
Mrs. Jin,

635
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
A-Xian is my brother.

636
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
No matter when,

637
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
I won't leave him.

638
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Li,

639
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
are you still mad at that guy?

640
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
If you're mad at him,

641
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
I'll...

642
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I'll go and teach him a lesson, okay?

643
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
No need to trouble me.

644
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
Mrs. Jin,

645
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
don't force him.

646
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
No, no, no.

647
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Mrs. Jin.

648
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
I'm sorry.

649
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
I'm sorry.

650
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
I'm sorry.

651
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,260
It's okay.

652
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
We'll stop here.

653
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jin.

654
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Li,

655
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,260
Zi Xuan,

656
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
go after her.

657
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Miss Jiang,

658
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
wait.

659
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
It's not what you think.

660
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
It's not what you think.

661
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
You...

662
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
No.

663
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
It's not what my mother means.

664
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
It's not forceful.

665
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
It's not forceful at all.

666
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
It's me.

667
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
I wanted you to come.

668
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
I...

669
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Zi Xuan.

670
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
Zi Xuan.

671
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
You fool.

672
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
What are you running for?

673
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
Young Master.

674
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Young Master.

675
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,260
Young Master.

676
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
Li,

677
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
sit down.

678
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
I'll go back to the Golden Tide.

679
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I'll be there in a while.

680
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
I'll go to the White Flower Pavilion.

681
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
I'll go to the White Flower Pavilion.

682
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
I'll go to the White Flower Pavilion.

683
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
I'll go to the White Flower Pavilion.

684
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I'll let that boy

685
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
apologize to you.

686
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Sit down.

687
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
Miss Jiang.

688
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
It's okay.

689
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Thank you.

690
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
Okay.

691
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
Okay.

692
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Since that's the case,

693
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,260
I'll be there to thank you.

694
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
Wei Wuxian.

695
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
Jiang Cheng,

696
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
you missed a good show just now.

697
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
What show?

698
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,260
Nothing.

699
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
I'm leaving.

700
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
Wei Wuxian,

701
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
where are you going?

702
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
There's still the White Flower Pavilion

703
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
after the hunting.

704
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
Come with me.

705
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
I want to go to Lanzheng.

706
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
You can go by yourself.

707
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Lan Zhan.

708
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,260
I'm leaving.

709
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,260
What a mess.

710
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
It's not your fault.

711
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
Chief Lan,

712
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,260
I saw Jian Mang

713
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
so I came here.

714
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
What happened just now?

715
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
It's better to go to the White Flower Pavilion

716
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
and see you

717
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
in person.

718
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Yes.

719
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
We're not strangers.

720
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Chief Jiang

721
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
told us to take a step forward.

722
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Chief Jiang,

723
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Mr. Wei of the Guizong

724
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
is really a character.

725
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
This time,

726
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
the White Flower Pavilion is a good place.

727
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Almost all the temples

728
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
have been taken

729
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
by the elite of the Yunmeng Army.

730
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Many of the repairs

731
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,260
will be done by him.

732
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,260
Yes.

733
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
What can we do?

734
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Who told us

735
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
that Wei Wuxian is not here?

736
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Wei Wuxian is not here.

737
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Wei Wuxian is not here.

738
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
Wei Wuxian is not here.

739
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Wei Wuxian is not here.

740
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Wei Wuxian is not a good thing.

741
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
I don't have so many people

742
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
at home.

743
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm always busy.

744
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Did you hear that?

745
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
Wei Wuxian's baby,

746
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
the Silver Tiger Pavilion,

747
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
was made by Silver Iron.

748
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
Really?

749
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
It's the one

750
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,260
that has been missing all the time?

751
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Last time,

752
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
I heard from the Head of the Flaming Manor.

753
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Although I just suspect it,

754
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
but think about it.

755
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
If it wasn't for the Silver Iron,

756
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
why would it be so coincidental?

757
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
The Silver Iron

758
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
was missing for a year.

759
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
Wei Wuxian

760
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
took out the Silver Tiger Pavilion.

761
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
I guess

762
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
it must have been

763
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
taken by Wei Wuxian.

764
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
You're right.

765
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Wei Wuxian is too arrogant.

766
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Anyway,

767
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
I won't go

768
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
as long as

769
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Jiang's family is involved.

770
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Jiang's family?

771
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
You don't see it, right?

772
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
To be honest,

773
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
it's because of Wei Wuxian.

774
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
At that time,

775
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
Wei Wuxian was not

776
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,260
a member of the Flaming Manor.

777
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
Only in the future

778
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,260
can we make such a big deal of money.

779
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Forget it.

780
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Let's go.

781
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Let's go.

782
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Let's go.

783
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,260
Hurry up.

784
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
You're so stupid.

785
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,260
I'm sorry.

786
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,260
Wang Jin.

787
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,260
You've been

788
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
worried about me.

789
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
But

790
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
what's on your mind?

791
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
Cheng Cheng.

792
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I...

793
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
I want to take someone

794
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
to the place where I can't see.

795
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Take someone

796
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,260
to the place where I can't see?

797
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Take him back

798
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
and hide him.

799
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,260
Hide him?

800
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,260
I don't know.

801
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,260
I don't know.

802
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
Hide him?

803
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,260
I'm afraid

804
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,260
he doesn't want to.

805
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
I'm afraid

806
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
I'm afraid

807
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
I'm afraid

808
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,260
I'm afraid
