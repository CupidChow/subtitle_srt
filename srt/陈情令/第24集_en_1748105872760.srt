The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000

The fifth one is the second one.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The second one is the main one.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The third one is the main one.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How did you forget about the olvwood root?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Your soul is getting hampered.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your soul is getting hampered.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Your soul is getting hampered.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Nobody can blame a master like me for being rebellious.

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
We are sorry to disappointed you.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Please forgive us.

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,740
Wake up!

40
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,620
Princess Jin, it's about marriage.

41
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,500
I think you should ask my senior sister

42
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,260
not directly about Jiang Cheng.

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,500
Am I right, Jiang Cheng?

44
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,780
Wei Wuxian,

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,300
I'm talking to Chief Jiang.

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,300
Do you have the right to talk?

47
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,620
Sure.

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,620
Then you should ask Jiang Cheng.

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,620
Brother Zongzhu,

50
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,900
your sister lost in the royal harem this time.

51
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:34,420
It's an era of

52
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,420
amsa in問我是看过你的

53
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,420
囑 haven的

54
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,220
depends

55
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,100
on my difference in acting with you.

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,100
And you know

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,060
That's right.

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,580
I have to ask

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,380
Miss Jiang about this.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,380
Senior sister.

61
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,620
Thank you for your kindness,

62
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,260
and you have my heart.

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,260
Jiang's family has just been through a lot.

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,740
As a daughter of Jiang's family,

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,340
I should take the big role.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,300
I will meet Lian Huawu

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,020
in Yunmeng.

68
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,780
At this moment,

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,820
I really can't discuss the wedding.

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
Princess Jin,

71
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,900
sorry.

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,900
Then how is variant?

73
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,180
I would die for him.

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,580
Darn it.

75
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,820
My revision news!

76
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:17,460
The

77
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:29,660
God-beheading

78
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,660
quite

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Actually, not only the Jiang family,

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
but also the Jingwen family,

81
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,660
all the families have their own problems.

82
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
At this moment,

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
it is the time for the hundred-faceted generation

84
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
to be extremely talented.

85
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
That's reasonable.

86
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
I must report it.

87
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,660
Father, your effort is not a waste.

88
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,660
You are on credit for the strategy.

89
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,660
Considerablenaire,

90
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,160
I request you to instance the didntines' granite Merry-Hell.

91
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,320
I will do my best to take on the Diamond Deityrum.

92
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,740
The Diamond Deityrum?

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,180
The Diamond Deityrum?

94
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,280
I need to know a few things.

95
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,220
A Solomon's증 позволays no one to be in such a previs・・・

96
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,340

97
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,500
to bring out the positions and adventures possible on you.

98
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,840
Wow, Mallr achievements are great!

99
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,440
Yeah.

100
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,620
That's right!

101
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,160
You are invited again

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,640
to check it out for yourself.

103
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Thank you, Princess Jin!

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Princess Jin is very good!

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes, Princess Jin.

106
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Princess Jin.

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Yes, Princess Jin.

108
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Come on.

109
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Thank you, Princess Jin.

110
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Come.

111
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Please.

112
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Princess Jin.

113
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Father.

114
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Father.

115
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
All of you, leave.

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Yes.

117
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
You did a good job.

118
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Thank you.

119
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
I dare not.

120
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I can share my father's burden.

121
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
It's my duty.

122
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Have you found out the cause of the silver iron?

123
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I haven't found out yet.

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I can't.

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I can't.

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I can't.

127
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
But...

128
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
But what?

129
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
When I was in the night sky,

130
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Wen Ruohan told me

131
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
that the last silver iron

132
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
was on Xueyang.

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
If I remember correctly,

134
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
you were a father in the Nye family.

135
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Did you meet with him?

136
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
I did.

137
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
But whether it was Chang's or Xueyang's,

138
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I didn't find out the cause.

139
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
But...

140
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Make it clear.

141
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Yes.

142
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
There is another possibility.

143
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Someone was on Xueyang's body.

144
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
I don't know if it was him.

145
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Someone was on Xueyang's body.

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
He took away the silver iron.

147
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Do you remember who was with Xueyang?

148
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I was Childe Wei.

149
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Wei Ying? Wei Wuxian?

150
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Wei Wuxian.

151
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Wei Wuxian.

152
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Father.

153
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
But Childe Wei was only responsible for taking care of Xueyang.

154
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
He also had a good relationship with Mr. Lan.

155
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
I think he wouldn't do such a thing.

156
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Moreover,

157
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
the silver tiger's talisman is very similar,

158
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
but it may not be related to the silver iron.

159
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Wei Wuxian.

160
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Where are they now?

161
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Mr. Wei just told the chief of Jiang.

162
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Wei Ying.

164
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
The silver iron is in the spirit.

165
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Four sides are in the spirit.

166
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
There are four silver iron in the world.

167
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Three of them

168
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
fell into the hands of the Wen family.

169
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
There is one more.

170
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
It disappeared with Xueyang's disappearance.

171
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,640
But it disappeared.

172
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Wei Wuxian

173
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
took the silver tiger talisman back.

174
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Ayao.

175
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
You just came back.

176
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Go to the Golden Forest Platform

177
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
and greet your mother.

178
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Yes.

179
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Wei Ying.

180
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Don't worry, father.

181
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
I'll send someone to watch over him.

182
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Wei Ying.

183
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Wei Ying.

184
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Wei Ying.

185
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Wei Ying.

186
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Wei Ying.

187
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Wei Ying.

188
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Wei Ying.

189
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Wei Ying.

190
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Wei Ying.

191
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Wei Ying.

192
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Wei Ying.

193
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Wei Ying.

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Wei Ying.

195
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Wei Ying.

196
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Wei Ying.

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Wei Ying.

198
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Wei Ying.

199
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Wei Ying.

200
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Wei Ying.

201
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Wei Ying.

202
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Wei Ying.

203
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Wei Ying.

204
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Wei Ying.

205
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Wei Ying.

206
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Wei Ying.

207
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Wei Ying.

208
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Wei Ying.

209
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Wei Ying.

210
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Wei Ying.

211
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Wei Ying.

212
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
The worker

213
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
has sent the silver tiger talisman.

214
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
I

215
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
will take it.

216
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I will wait for the right time.

217
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I will send it.

218
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Wei Ying.

219
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Wei Ying.

220
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Wei Ying.

221
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Wei Ying.

222
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Brother.

223
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
I heard that

224
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Han Guangjun has come back

225
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
and went to the Library of the Library

226
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
and took away many of the books.

227
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
He only has a day and night to read.

228
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
So he came to see it.

229
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Brother.

230
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I want to go to the Library of the Library's library.

231
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Why?

232
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
To study the Qin tribe.

233
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Ze Wujun.

234
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Han Guangjun.

235
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Sir, please come over.

236
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's go.

237
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
The Chuyuan?

238
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Yes.

239
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Although I didn't

240
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
go to Qishan with you,

241
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
I was still

242
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
worried about the last battle.

243
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I heard about Wei Ying.

244
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
The Fu Dynasty

245
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
is in a mess.

246
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Now the sea and land are in a mess.

247
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
It's easy to get rid of the evil blood.

248
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Plus,

249
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
the Wen clan's method of cultivation

250
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
is too much.

251
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
If we don't resolve it soon,

252
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm afraid

253
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
we will be killed.

254
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
What Uncle said is...

255
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Uncle.

256
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Wang Ji.

257
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
This time,

258
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
you don't have to go with me.

259
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
I have other tasks to do for you.

260
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I left the library that day.

261
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
I was in a hurry.

262
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
I couldn't avoid losing and losing.

263
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Now, the most important thing is

264
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
to re-create the library.

265
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
To re-create the family.

266
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Without the rules,

267
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
we won't be Fang Yuan.

268
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Jiaxun is the foundation of our Lan clan.

269
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,640
I hope you can remember my words.

270
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Uncle.

271
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
I want to go to the city.

272
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Uncle.

273
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Do you want to read more

274
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
the book of the library?

275
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Uncle.

276
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
I want to go to the city.

277
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Why do you need to go to the city?

278
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Wang Ji.

279
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Don't you know

280
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
why I don't allow you to go to the city with Xi Chen?

281
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
I can't.

282
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
I can't.

283
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
I can't.

284
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
I can't.

285
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
I can't go.

286
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I just want to go.

287
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I can't.

288
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
You were just here,

289
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
why haven't you came back before I do.

290
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian, Yu Zi Yuan Zhi Zi.

291
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,640
From today on, I am the head of the Jiang family, Yun Meng.

292
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Jiang family, Jia Xun, I know I can't be called as a son.

293
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
As long as I have a son in Jiang Cheng,

294
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
I will be able to live a life of peace and happiness.

295
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,640
I will be able to live a life of peace and happiness.

296
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,640
I will be able to live a life of peace and happiness.

297
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
As long as I have a son in Jiang Cheng,

298
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
I will be able to live a life of peace and happiness.

299
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,640
I will not let Jiang family suffer this.

300
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

301
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

302
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

303
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

304
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

305
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

306
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

307
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

308
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

309
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I am Jiang Cheng, Jiang Feng Mian.

310
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Long live the の.

311
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Are you undying?

312
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,640
In a pinch.

313
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm going to use my hand to catch you.

314
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Go!

315
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Go!

316
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
I'm going to use my hand to catch you.

317
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm going to use my hand to catch you.

318
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Go!

319
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Go!

320
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Go!

321
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
You can't even catch me.

322
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Why are you still practicing?

323
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Master!

324
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Master, the evil sect sent people to deliver the bow.

325
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Go!

326
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Two!

327
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Go!

328
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Three!

329
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Go!

330
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Four!

331
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Go!

332
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
I don't have time now.

333
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Go and find Wei Wuxian.

334
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Senior, he's not in the lotus room.

335
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
He's not here again?

336
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Three!

337
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Go!

338
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
He's not going to the city again, is he?

339
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Four!

340
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Cheng.

341
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Sister.

342
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
One!

343
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
I'll go over there later.

344
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Go and check it out.

345
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Don't take the class.

346
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Yes.

347
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Three!

348
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Go!

349
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
The lotus room is still the same.

350
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
But everything is different.

351
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Maybe...

352
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
One!

353
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
He's not used to it.

354
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
He's not used to it?

355
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
I'm not used to it?

356
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
But he's used to it at home.

357
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
He even said he wanted to help my family.

358
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
I don't think he's that kind of person.

359
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Cheng.

360
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Four!

361
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Go!

362
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
One!

363
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Use your strength.

364
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Go!

365
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Raise your hands higher.

366
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Two!

367
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
Go!

368
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Three!

369
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Go!

370
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Zewu Jun.

371
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
What a coincidence.

372
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
It turns out that it's Master Wei.

373
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Why is Zewu Jun here?

374
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
He's here to dream.

375
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
If you're not in a hurry,

376
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
come and have a drink.

377
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I forgot.

378
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
You can't drink in the Lan family.

379
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
It's okay.

380
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Zewu Jun.

381
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
It's been a long time.

382
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Compared to Lan Zhan,

383
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
it's just a place on the same earth.

384
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Could it be...

385
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Could it be that Zewu Jun is the same as me?

386
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
You're drinking all the time

387
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
in the Cloud Recesses.

388
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Zewu Jun.

389
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Wei Ying.

390
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Wei Ying.

391
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Wei Ying.

392
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Wei Ying.

393
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Wei Ying.

394
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Wei Ying is wrong.

395
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Actually, I used the gold pill to draw the wine.

396
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
It's actually not a drink.

397
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
You're really good at it.

398
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
But Zewu Jun.

399
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Lan Zhan is usually

400
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
the most interested

401
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
in the housework.

402
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
Why didn't he come?

403
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
He was left at home.

404
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
He's now ready to return home.

405
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Zewu Jun.

406
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
It's just a place on the same earth.

407
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
So many houses.

408
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
It's just like a prison.

409
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
It's been three years.

410
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Forget it.

411
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
I've been busy lately.

412
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
I'll go to the Cloud Recesses with you

413
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
and see it.

414
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
I think it's the house

415
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
that he used to hide in the library.

416
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Now,

417
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
I'm going to see it.

418
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
I'm going to see it.

419
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm going to see it.

420
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Now,

421
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm going to see it.

422
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
It's more interesting.

423
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
If you come to Gusu,

424
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
you can listen to

425
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
the old songs of Wangji's new school.

426
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
It's all about the spirit.

427
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
What does Zewu Jun mean?

428
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Wangji has been enjoying himself in the capital recently.

429
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I wonder if you

430
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
know the meaning of Wangji.

431
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Zewu Jun came to the Cloud Recesses

432
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
to persuade me.

433
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,640
He came to treat others as a guest.

434
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Zewu Jun.

435
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
I wonder if your family in Lan family

436
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
is so fond of the fairy tale.

437
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Wangji is my younger brother.

439
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I know his feelings very well.

440
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
I have to tell you

441
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
that you are not listening to me.

442
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
There are rules and regulations.

443
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
If there is only one person in the world,

444
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
you can do whatever you want.

445
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
But unfortunately,

446
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
everyone in the world

447
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
is talking about it.

448
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
I hope you don't

449
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
care about yourself

450
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
and affect the people around you.

451
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
If you believe that I have forgotten,

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Gusu and Lan family

453
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
can help you to meet again.

454
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
I believe it.

455
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
But I don't want to.

456
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Master Wei.

457
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
The path is in vain.

458
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
The tiger is in a difficult position.

459
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Once you lose your mind,

460
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
you will...

461
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
I just want to try.

462
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Maybe,

463
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm just a genius.

464
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
I'm sorry.

465
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Jiang Cheng, you haven't slept yet?

466
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
It's good that I brought you some wine.

467
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm sorry.

468
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,640
What are you doing all day?

469
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,640
How many times do you have to wipe your sword?

470
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
How long has it been?

471
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
It's been in the room.

472
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
It's enough to wipe it once a month.

473
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
I don't deserve to see you.

474
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I'm busy with work.

475
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
I'm always in the hotel.

476
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I don't know.

477
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
I thought you drank too much

478
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
and had a lot of fun.

479
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
You were in a daze.

480
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Jiang Cheng, don't be so angry.

481
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Go away.

482
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
What's wrong?

483
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,640
You drank too much and lost your energy.

484
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Look at yourself now.

485
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
You even said you would help me to make a living.

486
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Don't come over.

487
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
What do you mean?

488
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Are you going to do it?

489
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm tired.

490
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
I'm going to wake him up tomorrow.

491
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm going to sleep.

492
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Sister.

493
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
Xian, come over here.

494
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Did you have a fight with Cheng again?

495
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
I'm used to it.

496
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
It's okay.

497
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
It'll be fine in a few days.

498
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Don't worry.

499
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Xian.

500
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Are you...

501
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Don't you want to stay in the Lotus House?

502
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Sister, what are you talking about?

503
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
The Lotus House is my home.

504
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm not staying here.

505
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Where are you going?

506
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
I didn't mean that.

507
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
I'm just afraid...

508
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Sister,

509
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
if Uncle Jiang hadn't picked me up,

510
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
I'm afraid I'd still be on the street.

511
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
No matter what happens,

512
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
I won't leave the Lotus House,

513
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
nor will I leave you and Jiang Cheng.

514
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Sister,

515
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
I know

516
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I've been too reckless these days.

517
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
I'll change.

518
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I won't change again.

519
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Don't be angry.

520
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Silly girl.

521
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Why would I be angry with you?

522
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
But you...

523
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
You don't remember

524
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
what happened when you were little, right?

525
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
I do.

526
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
But I remember what you told me.

527
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Don't talk.

528
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Go, go, go.

529
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
Go.

530
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
You little brat.

531
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Brother Wang.

532
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Brother Wang.

533
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Brother Wang.

534
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Wei Ying?

535
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
Wei Ying.

536
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Can you go home with me?

537
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
You were born

538
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
with a smile on your face.

539
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
A smile.

540
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
No matter what you feel sad,

541
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
you won't let go of your heart.

542
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
No matter what you put on yourself,

543
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
you'll still be happy.

544
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
It's just that you have this kind of temper.

545
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Only then can you bear

546
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Cheng's temper.

547
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Sister,

548
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
I don't have any good temper.

549
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
It's not because of you.

550
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
If it's not because of you,

551
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
I guess I've been beaten to death

552
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
by Jiang Cheng hundreds of times.

553
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
You.

554
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Don't look at Cheng's mother.

555
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Actually,

556
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
she cares about you.

557
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
She's worried about you.

558
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Now,

559
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
my parents have passed away.

560
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
In this world,

561
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
only the three of us

562
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
are the closest people.

563
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Sister.

564
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm hungry.

565
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Why are you still like a child?

566
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Thank you.

567
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
You're three years old.

568
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
By the way, sister.

569
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
I've been wanting to ask you

570
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
a question.

571
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Go ahead.

572
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Why

573
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
do you like someone else?

574
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I mean,

575
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
the kind of person I like.

576
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Why did you ask me this?

577
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Do you like someone else?

578
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
No, sister.

579
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
I don't like someone else.

580
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
At least,

581
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
don't like someone else.

582
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Isn't it just

583
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
to give yourself a gun

584
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
and shoot a gun?

585
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
You're three years old.

586
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
You're one year old.

587
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Fine.

588
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
I said three years old.

589
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
I'm three years old.

590
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I'm hungry.

591
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
There's a kitchen.

592
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Go ahead.

593
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I don't know

594
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
if one year old

595
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
can make a living.

596
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
If not,

597
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
I'll be enough.

598
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
You're not like this.

599
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
You're not like this.

600
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Hey,

601
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
how old are you?

602
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
You're still in the house.

603
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Are you still in the house?

604
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm not in the house.

605
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Now, I'm the one

606
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
who's got all the things.

607
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
I can do whatever I want.

608
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Can you handle it?

609
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
What?

610
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Sister just told me

611
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
that she made me

612
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
lotus root and ribs soup.

613
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Where's the soup?

614
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
I finished it.

615
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Now, I only have the lotus root.

616
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Where do you want it?

617
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
You'd better spit it out for me.

618
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Spit it out?

619
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
If you want me to spit it out,

620
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
you can eat it.

621
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Fine.

622
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
I'll spit it out.

623
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Come on.

624
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Okay, you two.

625
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
How old are you?

626
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
You're so old.

627
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
You're still making some ribs soup.

628
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
I'll just make one more.

629
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Cheng,

630
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
do you still look like a family member?

631
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
By the way,

632
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
do you remember

633
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
the time when you said

634
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
that you'll be a family member

635
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
and you'll be able to serve me?

636
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Just like your father

637
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
serving my father.

638
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Of course, I remember

639
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
that we had the same dream

640
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
when we were twins.

641
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Don't drag me down.

642
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
I never dragged you down.

643
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Okay, I'll make you some soup.

644
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
By the way,

645
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
after a month,

646
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
it's the Baifeng Mountain Festival.

647
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
This is the first time

648
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
that the Sun's Sun is at the top.

649
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
You can be my friend

650
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
when you arrive in Lanzhou.

651
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Especially,

652
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
it's a little bit of a trouble

653
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
for Jin Zixuan.

654
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
No matter what,

655
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
he's a good son of Jin Guangshan.

656
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
He'll be the heir

657
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
of the Lanling Jin clan

658
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
and the future master.

659
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
If you two fight,

660
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
what about me?

661
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Am I going to help you

662
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
beat him up

663
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
or punish you?

664
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
There's been

665
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
more of a Jin Guangyao lately.

666
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
I didn't know

667
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
how to deal with him.

668
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
But I think

669
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
he has more

670
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
smooth eyes than that of Huakong Que.

671
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
What's the point of smooth eyes?

672
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
No matter how smooth he is,

673
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
no matter how powerful he is,

674
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
he can only be

675
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
a family member who comes and goes.

676
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
He's just a member of the Lanling Jin clan.

677
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
He's just a member of the Lanling Jin clan.

678
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
How can he be compared to Jin Zixuan?

679
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Jiang Cheng,

680
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
let me ask you.

681
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Last time,

682
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
in the late night,

683
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
what did you think?

684
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Do you really want

685
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
to be his sister?

686
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
I don't think so.

687
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
You don't think so?

688
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
When he was in the Holy Land,

689
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
did you do something

690
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
that you didn't know?

691
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Now, you tell me

692
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
that you don't think so?

693
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
He probably regretted it.

694
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
How could he regret it?

695
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Do you really want to forgive him?

696
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Besides,

697
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
look at his father's bad character.

698
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
He's so cunning.

699
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
He might have learned

700
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
how to be a woman

701
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
in the South Sea after he was born.

702
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
If you can bear to

703
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
follow him,

704
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
he will...

705
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
But

706
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
it's not up to us

707
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
whether to forgive him or not.

708
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
Who told you to like him?

709
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I really like him.

710
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
I like him because

711
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
he's not good.

712
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
I really like him.

713
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
I like him because

714
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
he's not good.

715
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
It's strange.

716
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
I locked it in the morning.

717
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
No one.

718
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
No one?

719
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
No one?

720
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I didn't lock it in the morning?

721
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Si Zheng,

722
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
don't tell Han Guang Jun.

723
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
No one.

724
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
No one.

725
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
No one.

726
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Maybe it's not hard

727
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
to go back to the past.

728
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
I'm not afraid of the future.

729
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
I'm afraid of the future.

730
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I'm afraid of the future.

731
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
I'm afraid of the future.

732
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I'm afraid of the future.

733
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
I'm afraid of the future.

734
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I'm afraid of the future.

735
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I'm afraid of the future.

736
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
I'm afraid of the future.

737
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
I'm afraid of the future.

738
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
I'm afraid of the future.

739
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
I'm afraid of the future.

740
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
I'm afraid of the future.

741
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
I'm afraid of the future.

742
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
I'm afraid of the future.
