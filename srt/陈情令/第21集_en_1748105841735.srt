Sit

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
down.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're so thin.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Sister.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're thin, too.

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000

Sister.

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No matter how far I've gone,

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and me,

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
will never be separated.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Will never be separated.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then don't ever see each other again.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay?

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I won't ever.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wei Xiu.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wei Xiu.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Wei Xiu.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wei Xiu.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Wei Xiu.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I heard they said you're back.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's really you.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're really...

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Nie Xiu.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Long time no see.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Wei Xiu.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you know that you've been missing for months?

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Everyone is looking for you.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Especially Mr. Lan and Jiang.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They're all...

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Enough.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're done talking.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not done talking to Wei Xiu.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Listen.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's have dinner.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Xian.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm going to prepare the dishes.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Have a good rest.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I just came back.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't be too tired.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to the banquet tonight.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just you wait.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
alnya.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How come Vine谷 Sir ...

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How come Vine谷 Sir ...

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How come wine in my eyes?

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How come wine in my eyes?

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How come wine in my eyes?

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,040
pie

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,420
Is it done?

120
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,800
Your Majesty Please don't do this

121
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,520
Get out!

122
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,200
Get out of here!

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
What is this?

124
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
What is this?

125
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,360
I want to see how you can set up this world!

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Master Jiang,

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Master Wei has returned safely.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
He is the best of my men.

129
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Come, everyone.

130
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Let's toast to Master Wei.

131
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Cheers, Master Wei.

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Cheers, Master Wei.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Wei Wuxian.

134
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Come.

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll drink it.

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I'll drink it.

137
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Cheers.

138
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Cheers.

139
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Master Wei,

140
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
why don't you have a meeting today?

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
You don't want to have a meeting, do you?

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
As a disciple of the family,

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
it's not easy to be a good match.

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I know you are not very good at it.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
But it's a little bit difficult

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
to be a good match.

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I've heard that you are good at swordplay.

148
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I wanted to compete with you today.

149
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
But I didn't expect that you don't even match your sword.

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I really don't want to be a good match.

151
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Wei Wuxian.

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Wei Wuxian.

153
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Tell us how you killed Wenchao.

154
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
It's not easy to be a good match.

155
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I'll do it myself.

156
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Well...

157
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
What does he mean?

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I heard

159
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
that Wenchao was killed

160
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
by the torture of the people.

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm afraid that even his real father

162
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
can't recognize him.

163
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Yes, I heard that.

164
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
He was killed by the torture of the people.

165
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Mr. Wei has made a strange magic.

166
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
He even stole the stone from the Buddha.

167
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Maybe he made some tricks.

168
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
A-Xian.

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Where is Mr. Lan?

170
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't know.

171
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Are you not

172
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
a good match

173
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
for the people?

174
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm not.

175
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm just a good match for you.

176
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
You are a good match for the people.

177
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm not a good match for you.

178
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I just want to be with him.

179
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Really?

180
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Everyone.

181
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Now,

182
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
the four of us

183
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
are working together.

184
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
We will kill Wenchao

185
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
and kill him.

186
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
We will kill him.

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
That's right.

188
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Come on.

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
What's going on?

190
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
What's going on?

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
What's going on?

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
What's going on?

193
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
This...

194
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Oh!

195
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
That hairpin is calling God!

196
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
End of the game.

197
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Fine.

198
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Leave it in thessa

199
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,300
and recover yourself.

200
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Almost forgot to bring a family picture

201
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,300
If I

202
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,580
Why propose

203
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,280
You left early

204
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,000
I am worried about you

205
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,560
Why did you massage my face

206
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
What do you think

207
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
It's because of Lan Wangji.

208
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Since that time he has been avoiding you.

209
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Why are you here to find him and make him feel free?

210
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Maybe I'm bored.

211
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Wei Wuxian, I've found it for you.

212
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Why don't you match it today?

213
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
He said he doesn't want to.

214
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
In the future, you can't be with him in this big business.

215
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Let's catch the one who doesn't have a home in the county.

216
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Let's go and get some rest.

217
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Jiang Cheng, you don't know me.

218
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm not good at doing things that make me want to.

219
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
I don't deserve to be with you.

220
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Besides, I don't want to be dragged by those who don't know me.

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,320
My advice is to be careful.

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
So, don't bother me.

223
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
I'll just leave you alone.

224
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,320
You used to like to do the swordwork, right?

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I used to be a kid.

226
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
I can only be a kid forever.

227
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,320
A-Xie, I didn't close the door.

228
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
A-Xie, what's wrong?

229
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Senior sister, I'm fine.

230
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I've never seen you get the bamboo flute.

231
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Senior sister.

232
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Senior sister.

233
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Are you okay? He didn't hurt you, right?

234
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm fine.

235
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,320
So, he's recognized you as the master?

236
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Of course, he's right.

237
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Then he's your medical spirit.

238
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
It's like my mother's purple palace.

239
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
A-Xie, what's his name?

240
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I haven't thought about it yet.

241
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Since he's a medical spirit, why can't he have a name?

242
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
You can't fool him.

243
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Can't he be as casual as your sword?

244
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm not sure.

245
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Can't he be as casual as your sword?

246
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Then call him Chen Qing.

247
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Chen Qing?

248
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Chen Qing.

249
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Master, some things can't be used.

250
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
The river has been used.

251
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,320
The water in the rain has been colored and the book has been colored.

252
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
The pillow is colored.

253
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
It's not colored.

254
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Master, the spirit is a weapon.

262
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
The spirit is a weapon.

263
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
The spirit is a single-minded man.

264
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
It can be used by the mountains and seas.

265
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
It's also a weapon.

266
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Why can't it be used?

267
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,320
A-Xie, I saw you didn't eat anything today.

268
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Have some soup.

269
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
What's wrong, Senior?

270
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
A-Xie.

271
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
You're sick.

272
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Where have you been these three months?

273
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Senior, you're too green.

274
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Wake up.

275
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I saw you grow up.

276
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
How can you hide it from me?

277
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
I saw you grow up.

278
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,320
But it's good to be back.

279
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
The three of us are the most important.

280
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
As for the rest,

281
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
we'll talk about it when you want to.

282
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Okay?

283
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
Okay, okay.

284
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
I won't talk about it.

285
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
You just came back.

286
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
You need to rest.

287
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
I...

288
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
I'll go and send it to A-Ching.

289
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Senior,

290
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
you're so kind.

291
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
You gave A-Ching so much soup.

292
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Senior.

293
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
This soup

294
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
is so good.

295
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Thank you for coming back.

296
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
It's so good.

297
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
A-Xie.

298
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
A-Xie.

299
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
A-Xie.

300
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
A-Xie.

301
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
A-Xie.

302
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
A-Xie.

303
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
A-Xie.

304
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Did you see the Wu County?

305
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
No.

306
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
What's wrong?

307
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Isn't she in her room?

308
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,120
in the room?

309
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
Today, Zou Jun came back.

310
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,640
The commandant ordered the people to go to the business.

311
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,840
Now, the people are all here.

312
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,880
He's the only one who's not here.

313
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
This is not dangerous.

314
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
He'll find me when he comes back.

315
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,960
All right.

316
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,120
You're all family members.

317
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,240
You're still so anxious.

318
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
Well, you go to the meeting first.

319
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,160
I'll take people to find them.

320
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,560
After all, he just came back.

321
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,320
Don't push him too hard.

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Maybe he just went out to relax.

323
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,640
It's this time.

324
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
How can he relax?

325
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,600
It's okay to be at home.

326
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
Don't you think it's funny?

327
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,600
Sister, you're so bad.

328
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,320
All right.

329
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,160
Go now.

330
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Go now.

331
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,720
I'll go find him.

332
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Although we're not in the military,

333
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
we're not in the military.

334
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
We're not in the military,

335
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
but Wei Wuxian is a little too arrogant.

336
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Wei Wuxian is a little too arrogant.

337
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
The people think he killed Wen Chao.

338
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
The people think he killed Wen Chao.

339
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
That's why they've been waiting for him for so long.

340
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Mr. Chi,

341
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
he killed Wen Chao.

342
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,560
But you killed Wen Xu.

343
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Even if Wei Wuxian has the power,

344
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
he can't let so many people

345
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
wait for him.

346
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
You bastard.

347
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Everyone,

348
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Wei Wuxian just arrived at Qingheng.

349
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
He was seriously injured.

350
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Injured?

351
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Why didn't I see him get injured?

352
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Chief Jiang,

353
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,560
you're the family member of Jiang's clan.

354
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Wei Ying is your subordinate.

355
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Since you asked her to come to the meeting,

356
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
does she still have a reason to not come?

357
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
I wonder if she

358
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
is hiding something from you

359
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
to do something else.

360
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Could it be

361
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,560
that she's been doing those dirty tricks again?

362
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
This is our Jiang clan's business.

363
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
It has nothing to do with you.

364
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Enough.

365
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Don't mind this.

366
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Now that Wen Ruohan and his son are dead,

367
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
they're like two walls.

368
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
It's the perfect time

369
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
for us to break the good old days.

370
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
The government is here.

371
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
We need to work together.

372
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
As you said,

373
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Chief Jiang,

374
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
if you can't attend today,

375
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
please tell me

376
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
what you want to do today.

377
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Enough.

378
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Let's continue.

379
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Hurry up.

380
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Hurry up.

381
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Hurry up.

382
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Wait.

383
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Hurry up.

384
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Don't move.

385
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Hurry up.

386
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Go.

387
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Don't move.

388
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Hurry up.

389
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Stay here.

390
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Go.

391
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Hurry up.

392
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Stay there.

393
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Hurry up.

394
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Go.

395
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Go.

396
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Go.

397
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Go.

398
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Go.

399
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Hurry up.

400
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Hurry up.

401
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Hurry up.

402
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
What did I do?

403
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Stop.

404
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Go.

405
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Stay there.

406
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Hurry up.

407
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Stop.

408
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Don't move.

409
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Stop.

410
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Stay there.

411
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Go.

412
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
What's going on?

413
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
It's nothing.

414
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Don't be afraid.

415
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Let's follow them.

416
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Don't hurt Tang Wang.

417
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
This is your home.

418
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Miss Qin,

419
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
where are they taking us?

420
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
I don't know.

421
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
It's just a place

422
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
where the guards are.

423
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
I don't know if you're there.

424
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Oh, no.

425
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
If it weren't for Master Wen

426
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
who let the Five-day-Lady go,

427
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
you and Mr. Ning

428
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
wouldn't have been

429
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
in the same boat.

430
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
No.

431
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Don't say that.

432
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Just keep your eyes on A-ning.

433
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Go.

434
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Hurry up.

435
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Hurry up.

436
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Hurry up.

437
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Don't move.

438
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Stay there.

439
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Hurry up.

440
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Go.

441
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Go.

442
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Come on.

443
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Granny.

444
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Granny.

445
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Are you all right, Granny?

446
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Hurry up.

447
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Get up.

448
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Granny.

449
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,560
Come on,

450
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
stand up.

451
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Step back.

452
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Put up your stands.

453
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Hello?

454
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Do you need anything?

455
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
You might need some help.

456
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Come on.

457
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Stop.

458
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:32,880
We need you to

459
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,360
do right now.

460
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,220
I said help.

461
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Hurry up!

462
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Hurry up!

463
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
Get up!

464
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Get up!

465
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,220
What was that?

466
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Ghost!

467
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Ghost!

468
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Ghost!

469
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Hurry up!

470
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
Follow me!

471
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
Hurry up!

472
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Go!

473
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Be careful!

474
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
Hurry up!

475
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
Go!

476
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Get out of here!

477
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Stop!

478
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,220
Hurry up!

479
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
Go!

480
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Go!

481
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
Hurry up!

482
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Ah Xian, what's wrong?

483
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Nothing.

484
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
Senior Sister, why are you here?

485
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Ze Wu Jun is back.

486
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
The Chifeng Sect is in a hurry to see you.

487
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Cheng Cheng is in a hurry to see you.

488
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
Ah Xian.

489
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
Just now...

490
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,220
What's going on?

491
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
The wind was too strong just now.

492
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,220
It was very windy.

493
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,220
It was very windy.

494
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Did something happen?

495
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
Did something happen?

496
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Since there's nothing wrong,

497
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
let's go back.

498
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,220
Ah Xian, what's wrong?

499
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
Nothing.

500
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Let's go, Senior Sister.

501
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
As you all said,

502
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
the cold and cold is already gone.

503
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
No one is able to lead the army to the base.

504
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Now, there's only one army left.

505
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
We'll wait for the army to enter the long-term.

506
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
We must destroy the Wens.

507
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
Although it is so,

508
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,220
don't worry about it.

509
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
The cold and cold is the biggest threat.

510
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
It's not the second time.

511
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,220
It's the Yin Iron and its shield.

512
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Ze Wu Jun is right.

513
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,220
The reason why the cold and cold are so strong

514
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
is because it has a shield.

515
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,220
It can control other people.

516
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
It can control the shield and fight against people.

517
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
That's why we're discussing

518
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
what we're going to do today.

519
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,220
How to deal with the Yin Iron in the hands of the cold and cold.

520
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Brother Wei.

521
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Wei Wuxian.

522
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
Wei Wuxian.

523
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
Wei Wuxian.

524
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Wei Wuxian.

525
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
Wei Wuxian.

526
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Wei Wuxian.

527
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
Wei Wuxian.

528
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,220
Wei Wuxian.

529
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Wei Wuxian.

530
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
With you coming,

531
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
I'll be a good person.

532
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Wei Wuxian.

533
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
I'll take care of the other forces.

534
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
You could go with me.

535
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
I'll go.

536
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
This way.

537
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,340
Let's talk more clearly.

538
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,420
Lord Zewu,

539
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,940
Wei Ying didn't hide it.

540
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,340
I'll share it with you after the moon.

541
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,980
Childe Wei,

542
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
why don't you cooperate with me?

543
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,220
I don't want to cooperate.

544
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,700
Is Wei Wuxian

545
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,420
intentionally trying to trick us?

546
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,020
Why is there a special power in the Yin Iron?

547
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,420
Is it my own special power?

548
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,820
Wang Ji,

549
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,780
why are you so sure

550
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,540
that you can find the Yin Iron

551
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,780
in the Moon?

552
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,660
I don't know.

553
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,900
You must have

554
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,300
Was it your fault

555
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,220
you tried so hard

556
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,820
to convert him into a slaves?

557
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,980
Wang Ji,

558
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,780
I have something to ask you.

559
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,140
Has the distant death

560
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,940
been involved with the Yin Iron?

561
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,420
No, brother, he will not be like this.

562
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,420
But the matter of the forest is indeed a little bit of a waste.

563
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,420
Did you find any meaning when you arrived at the forest?

564
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,420
Brother, is there a certain law in the world?

565
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,420
I once thought that the more I tried to hide the book of the forest,

566
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,420
the more I could understand the world.

567
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,420
But then I found that even if I had to expose the world,

568
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,420
there were too many things in the world that I could not understand.

569
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,420
The law of the world is not certain.

570
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,420
It is not that the world is not divided by the black and white.

571
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
If we cannot set the standard of the black and white,

572
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
how can we set the heart of a person?

573
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,420
A person is a person.

574
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,420
But in my case, it is not that the world is black and white.

575
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,420
If we are a person, it is not that the black and white are not.

576
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
It is that we are with the heart.

577
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420
Brother.

578
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:51,420
Wangji, if you are worried about Childe Wei, then no.

579
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Talk well.

580
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
What are you talking about?

581
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,420
You and Lan Wangji are going to be in the same boat.

582
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Lan Zhan is not going to talk to me.

583
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
It is not that I don't want to talk to him.

584
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
It seems that he used to like to talk to you.

585
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Jiang Cheng, didn't you not like him before?

586
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
How can you talk to him now?

587
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
What are you talking about?

588
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,420
Now we are in the same boat.

589
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
The four families are in the same boat.

590
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
No need to be in a small boat.

591
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
It is not a big deal.

592
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Besides, in the past, in the forest,

593
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,420
you also collected those dirty things.

594
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,420
It is a good thing to see.

595
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
You can't waste it.

596
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,420
What are you doing?

597
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,420
You really have a family now.

598
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
Second Young Master.

599
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Miss Jian.

600
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,420
Are you here to see Xian?

601
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,420
Second Young Master.

602
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,420
Second Young Master.

603
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,420
I have something to ask you.

604
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,420
This is a loss.

605
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,420
It is more painful.

606
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,420
What should we do?

607
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
The right path is still in the way.

608
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,420
The magic spell can only be used.

609
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
It can't be used as a rest.

610
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
Lan Zhan.

611
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
What are you talking about with my senior sister?

612
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
Wei Ying.

613
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
I remember that I said that

614
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,420
you should not interfere with the Jiang family.

615
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Xian.

616
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
Second Young Master, he is...

617
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,420
Xian, what's wrong?

618
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,420
I was worried about you.

619
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,420
So I asked you why you were so angry.

620
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
What's the big deal?

621
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Senior sister.

622
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,420
Lan Zhan.

623
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,420
Did he tell you about the matter of Yiling's investigation?

624
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
He didn't say anything.

625
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Lan Zhan.

626
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Lan Zhan, listen to me.

627
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Lan Zhan.

628
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Lan Zhan.

629
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
It's been months.

630
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
You have grown up again.

631
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
You have lost your sense of taste.

632
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Whatever.

633
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Lan Zhan.

634
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
Lan Zhan.

635
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
Lan Zhan.

636
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,420
Lan Zhan.
