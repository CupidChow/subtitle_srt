Musques are stick to the skin during travel.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000

Musits are free.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Follow me.

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't do anything.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
It's just that Wen Ning is a big boss.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I mean,

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
Wen Ning can't always follow me like this.

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
After all, she's not my servant.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Besides,

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
this matter is over.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She really can't follow me anymore.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She always follows me like this.

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
As a friend,

55
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I should always find her a good friend.

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Han Guang Jun, what do you think?

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
At least,

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
she has a few friends.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Lan Zhan,

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think your family is pretty good.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't be mad.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't be mad.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't be mad.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Alright, little friend.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't be mad.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wen Ning,

67
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,000
it's not convenient for you to go up the street.

68
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,000
You just

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
stay in the inn and have a rest.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,500
I'll go and visit Lan Zhan.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,500
But...

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Don't worry.

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
I won't be in trouble.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Lan Zhan, wait for me.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Wait for me.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's time to go out.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come and have a look.

78
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
It's time to go out.

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Come, have a look.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The place where the light is shining

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is actually a temple.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The temple is a temple

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that is built on the ground

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and is the only one in the temple.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The temple is a temple

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that is built on the ground

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and is the only one in the temple.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The temple is a temple

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that is built on the ground

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and is the only one in the temple.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The temple is a temple

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that is built on the ground

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and is the only one in the temple.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The temple is a temple

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and is the only one in the temple.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
AuntUN.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I open the door.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can hear a police coming at

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tokyo High School.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I open the door,

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
the lights and light club.

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
The ballad button opens.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,600
The Fuck?

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Leave the light.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What happen when

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
there's a ghost meeters

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
covered in Berlin?

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's no one at the school tonight.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a disaster.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because it's too late.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you for the medicine.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Or my old man's illness won't be so good.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't come back tomorrow.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What's wrong?

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Tomorrow is the third day of the illness.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master, I heard that you're going to be in the fourth day tomorrow.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did something happen in the fourth day?

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Master, there's no big deal in the fourth day.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's just that the center of the four states has been in the past.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's time to rest.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I see.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
By the way, master,

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the temple and the temple are all built on the mountain.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The temple in the city is rare.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
People in the city are always busy.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's not necessary to make a temple like this to pray for the temple.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
To find the inner peace.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But the people in the city are not afraid to disturb the temple.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Master, you're not a big deal.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How can you be disturbed by others?

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're right.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is the temple only for the temple?

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Master, you're really a good person.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're not even blessed.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're just a little Buddha.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Master, you're really a good person.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000

You're really a good person.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're really a good person.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're really a good person.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're really a good person.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're really a good person.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000

What's the matter?

186
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Did you wake up the whole group?

187
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Xingzi.

188
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Xingzi.

189
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Zou Wujun.

190
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Zou Wujun.

191
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Zou Wujun.

192
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Xingzi.

193
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
I'll kill you if you call me again.

194
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Where are you going?

195
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Why is Xing Lin here?

196
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Why didn't I stop him?

197
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,820
Why are you waiting for me here?

198
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Xingzi.

199
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Is anyone here?

200
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Hey, is anyone here?

201
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Is anyone here?

202
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
Open the door.

203
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Don't hurt him.

204
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Is anyone here?

205
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Xingzi.

206
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Why are you holding me back?

207
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Zou Wujun.

208
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Hurry and leave with him.

209
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I beg you.

210
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Xingzi, run.

211
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Xingzi.

212
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I advise you not to blow the whistle.

213
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
The flute is not a big deal.

214
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
If you lose your fingers or tongue,

215
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
it's so sad.

216
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
You are right.

217
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Please.

218
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Lord Han.

219
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
You'd better not act rashly.

220
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
Wangji.

221
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Brother.

222
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Brother.

223
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
I'm ashamed.

224
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
I was deceived by others.

225
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I was caught and lost in the forest.

226
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Even if Shuo Yu and Liebing are with me,

227
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
I can't help it.

228
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Why are you ashamed?

229
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
It's just a good show

230
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
for Lord Lianfang.

231
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Childe Wei.

232
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
I really underestimated you.

233
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
I haven't asked you yet.

234
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Childe Wei will know this place.

235
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
But you and Lord Han

236
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
have been together for a long time.

237
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
You are here.

238
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,820
Lord Lianfang.

239
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
You forgot that you were in the secret room

240
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
in the Fangfei Hall.

241
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
You put the head of Lord Chi Feng together.

242
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Don't you remember?

243
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
That's my book.

244
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
I should separate it.

245
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
We can't turn the book around

246
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
to your palm now, right?

247
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
But Lord Lianfang.

248
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Can you satisfy my curiosity?

249
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
What is your treasure

250
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
in the secret room?

251
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
The price of the curiosity is not low.

252
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Childe Wei, are you sure you want to try it?

253
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
You are so stupid.

254
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
You can't do that.

255
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Uncle Xiao.

256
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Hello.

257
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
A-Lin.

258
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
What's wrong with you?

259
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Why did you come here at night?

260
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
You can't do that.

261
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
The Black-Haired Spirit Box is very fierce.

262
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
He is so aggressive.

263
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
I don't like it.

264
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
He ran away.

265
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
He went after her and killed her.

266
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
The spirit box is very smart.

267
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
It's not good for him to attract people.

268
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Yes.

269
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Uncle Xiao.

270
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
You gave me the letter.

271
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
You really want to kill him?

272
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
A-Lin.

273
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Why did you come here?

274
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Chief Jin.

275
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
A-Lin is a child.

276
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I know.

277
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
And she is your nephew.

278
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Brother.

279
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
What are you thinking?

280
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Of course I know that Jin Ling is a child.

281
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
She is also my nephew.

282
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Do you think I will do anything to her?

283
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Kill her?

284
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
A-Lin.

285
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
You heard it.

286
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
If you run away or fight,

287
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
maybe I will do something terrible to you.

288
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
You can do it yourself.

289
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Haven't you dug it yet?

290
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
Let the people inside move.

291
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Yes.

292
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
What is he drawing?

293
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
The knife.

294
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
The seal.

295
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
The thing that was stabbed.

296
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Almost.

297
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Almost.

298
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
I can see the good thing that I saw that year.

299
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
You guys.

300
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
A Yiling old group.

301
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
A righteous and honest.

302
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
You have a lot of power.

303
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
But in the end, you still have to be like this.

304
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Don't you want to be like this today?

305
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Han Guangjun.

306
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
You still don't let Bi Chen go.

307
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Do you really want to kill Childe Wei?

308
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Lan Zhan.

309
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Don't listen to him.

310
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
I never blamed you.

311
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Lan Zhan.

312
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
You go first.

313
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
Go find someone.

314
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
It's so urgent.

315
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Then next,

316
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,820
please take Bi Chen back to the bridge.

317
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Lan Zhan, don't.

318
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Jin Guangyao.

319
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Don't be so stubborn.

320
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
That's called being stubborn.

321
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
I will do it.

322
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
That's called being stubborn.

323
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
Then next,

324
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,820
I will have to do it myself by Han Guangjun.

325
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
To seal my own spirit.

326
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
What is it called?

327
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Lan Zhan.

328
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
Zewu Ju.

329
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
It's raining.

330
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
Go inside and seal it.

331
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Don't worry.

332
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
As long as you listen to me,

333
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
I won't do anything to you.

334
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
I will do it.

335
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Lan Zhan.

336
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
Actually, you don't have to do it.

337
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
That year,

338
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
in short,

339
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,820
you didn't owe me anything.

340
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
I didn't owe you anything.

341
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
I didn't owe you anything.

342
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
I didn't owe you anything.

343
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Lan Zhan.

344
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Lan Zhan.

345
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Lan Zhan.

346
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Lan Zhan.

347
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
Lan Zhan.

348
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Lan Zhan.

349
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Why did you do that?

350
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I didn't owe you anything.

351
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Then why did you do that?

352
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
That's what you should do.

353
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
Lan Zhan.

354
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Lan Zhan.

355
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
Who is it?

356
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Master, it's me.

357
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
Come in.

358
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
What's going on?

359
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
I met him in the woods.

360
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
It seems that the Yin-Nang is useful.

361
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
So I fell asleep.

362
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
You hurt him.

363
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,820
I didn't hurt him.

364
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
He fainted.

365
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,820
Min Shan.

366
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Don't be so heavy.

367
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,820
He doesn't fall down.

368
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
He doesn't fall down.

369
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
He doesn't fall down either.

370
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Yes.

371
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Why did you take down Huai Sang?

372
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
I have a lot of family members.

373
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
I can make others more impatient.

374
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
But please don't worry.

375
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
You know

376
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
how I treat Huai Sang.

377
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
When the time comes,

378
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
I will definitely

379
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
let you go.

380
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Should I believe you?

381
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
Just do as you wish.

382
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
Believe it or not.

383
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,820
I have no other way.

384
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,820
Lord Han.

385
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,820
The Yiling Clan.

386
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,820
I didn't expect

387
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
we would meet again so soon.

388
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
And the situation

389
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
has completely changed.

390
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
How is it?

391
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
How is the taste?

392
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
It's not changed.

393
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
You guys escaped

394
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
in the mess.

395
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
You guys escaped

396
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
because of the situation.

397
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I don't know

398
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
what to do.

399
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
You guys escaped.

400
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
And now

401
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
you are so anxious

402
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
to dig out the mess.

403
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
Are you also

404
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
going to escape?

405
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
It's already this time.

406
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
Lord Han has

407
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
a strong will to take me down.

408
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,820
I want to see

409
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
when you are ready.

410
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Lord Su.

411
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
When you were in my school

412
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,820
in the school in Gusulan,

413
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
we didn't treat you badly.

414
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Why did you

415
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
treat Wang Ji so badly?

416
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
I didn't treat

417
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
the Lan Er,

418
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,820
who was a genius.

419
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
I just couldn't

420
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
see how

421
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
he was

422
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
so cool.

423
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
When did he

424
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
say he was cool?

425
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,820
If I remember correctly,

426
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
in Gusulan's family,

427
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,820
there is a story

428
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
called

429
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,820
the family of Gusulan.

430
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
You remember it

431
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
when you are over.

432
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
Why are you

433
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
talking about Gusulan's family?

434
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
You think I want to escape?

435
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
I am...

436
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
I am not punished.

437
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Shame on you.

438
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
You...

439
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,820
Lord Su.

440
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,820
I have never

441
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
been so cold-hearted

442
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,820
since I was a kid.

443
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
That's why you think so.

444
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
If it's true,

445
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Lan Zhan is so wronged.

446
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
He is obviously

447
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
cold-hearted

448
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,820
to everyone.

449
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Lord Su.

450
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
You should be really happy.

451
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,820
You were not

452
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
studying in Yunmeng Jiang.

453
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Why?

454
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
Or else you would have

455
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
been so angry with me.

456
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
And I used to

457
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
think

458
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
I am a genius.

459
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
And I don't just

460
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
think so.

461
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,820
I also said it.

462
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Shut up!

463
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Lord Su.

464
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
I advise you not to do it.

465
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Lord Lianfang

466
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
is still a good person

467
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
to Lord Zewu.

468
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,820
If you hurt Lord Han Guang,

469
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
you will be happy

470
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
and not happy.

471
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
I really can't think of it.

472
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
The legend says

473
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
that the Lord Lianfang

474
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
is a good person

475
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
to Lord Zewu.

476
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Lord Lianfang

477
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
is a good person

478
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
to Lord Han Guang.

479
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,820
I am really sorry

480
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,820
for my mistake.

481
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
I am sorry.

482
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
The legend says that

483
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
the Lord Lianfang

484
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
who is so brave

485
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,820
will be scared to death.

486
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
It's easy to say.

487
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
But I am not scared to death.

488
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I just don't want to die.

489
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
It's a joke

490
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
to hear the words.

491
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Are there differences

492
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
between being scared to death

493
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
and not to die?

494
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Of course there are differences.

495
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
I have a life,

496
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
I don't ask for the brotherhood.

497
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
I have a life,

498
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
I don't want to die.

499
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
I don't ask for the brotherhood.

500
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,820
I am not afraid to die.

501
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Do you understand?

502
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
It's a good thing that you are brave.

503
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Good.

504
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Since you are not afraid to die,

505
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
I will support you.

506
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
Who?

507
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
Who?

508
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
Uncle.

509
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,820
Uncle.

510
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
You know to call me now?

511
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
You ran away before.

512
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Lan Zhan.

513
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
Xingzi.

514
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
Xingzi, bite him.

515
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Xingzi, bite him.

516
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
Xingzi, bite him.

517
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
Xingzi, bite him.

518
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Xingzi, now.

519
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Now, bite him.

520
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Master Jiang, be careful.

521
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Master Jiang, what should we do?

522
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,820
Master Jiang, I am so proud of you.

523
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
How did you find this place?

524
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Did Ling run everywhere?

525
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
You followed him to find this place.

526
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Xingzi must have brought you a way.

527
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
It was me who sent you.

528
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,820
But you didn't give me any face.

529
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Really?

530
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Xueyang and them are on the same way?

531
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Master Jiang,

532
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
what's wrong with you?

533
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
From the moment you got up,

534
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
your eyes were always shining.

535
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
You didn't dare to look that way.

536
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
Is there something there?

537
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,820
You should at least be a fairy.

538
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
You can't be so stupid.

539
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
You are still hiding?

540
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,820
There is nothing there.

541
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
That's your senior.

542
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,820
Are you really following Ling to find this place?

543
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
What else?

544
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,820
Who else can I find?

545
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Master Jiang, don't answer him.

546
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
He is so cunning.

547
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,820
As soon as he starts talking to him,

548
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,820
he will be transferred to the police.

549
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
He is so emotional.

550
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,820
Brother,

551
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
you really know me.

552
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
Master Wei,

553
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
did you see that?

554
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Your junior is not here to find you.

555
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
He doesn't even want to see you.

556
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Master Qin,

557
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,820
you are so strange.

558
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Master Jiang is not like this to me.

559
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
How could you remind me of that?

560
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,820
Master Jiang,

561
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
look,

562
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,820
it's not easy to be your senior.

563
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Master Qin,

564
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,820
it's not even easier to be your senior.

565
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
Master Jiang,

566
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,820
I heard that you were in the Lotus Manor

567
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,820
and had a big trouble.

568
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,820
You used the sword of the Yi-Ling Clan

569
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
to run around.

570
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,820
I called someone to fight.

571
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
My sword?

572
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,820
Did I just have a warm-up?

573
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
No,

574
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,820
I didn't see him today.

575
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,820
But how could he get the hand of Jiang Che?

576
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,820
Why would he want someone else to fight?

577
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
Did he fight for himself?

578
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,820
Wei Ying, calm down.

579
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,820
I heard that no one can pull out that sword.

580
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,820
But you pulled it out yourself.

581
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,820
This is strange.

582
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
I had hidden this sword

583
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
16 years ago.

584
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,820
It was sealed.

585
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
Other people

586
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,820
in the Yi-Ling Clan

587
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,820
can't pull it out.

588
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Shut up!

589
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,820
So I remember again.

590
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,820
Master Wei was so proud of himself.

591
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
He didn't even use the sword.

592
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
He always found different excuses.

593
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
I always thought it was strange.

594
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
What do you think?

595
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
What do you want to say?

596
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Master Jiang,

597
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,820
you are really amazing.

598
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,820
The youngest master

599
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,820
has the power to rebuild the Jiang clan.

600
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,820
I am very impressed.

601
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
But I remember that you were

602
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
much more than

603
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Master Wei.

604
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Could you please teach me

605
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,820
how you were attacked

606
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
by the Japanese?

607
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
Did you

608
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
eat some gold pills?

609
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
What?

610
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Be careful, uncle!

611
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Be careful!

612
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
Be careful!

613
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Uncle!

614
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
Be careful!

615
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,820
Take care of him.

616
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,820
Get out of the way!

617
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
Be careful!

618
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
Xingzi, run!

619
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
They are going to kill you!

620
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Master,

621
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
what?

622
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
Didn't you kill him?

623
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
I didn't.

624
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
I didn't kill him.

625
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
I didn't do anything.

626
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
Someone is trying to kill me.

627
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
I can't run away.

628
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
If I don't kill them,

629
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
I will run away.

630
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,820
I can run away as fast as I can.

631
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Master, I am here.

632
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,820
I can't run away.

633
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,820
Get out of the way!

634
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Yes, sir.

635
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
Be careful!

636
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Uncle,

637
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,820
thanks to the time you were holding me,

638
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
you were killed.

639
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
Shut up.

640
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
You know

641
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,820
when did Wen Ning say that?

642
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
When you don't wake up.

643
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
We just left Lotus House like this.

644
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
She is too much.

645
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,820
I will keep an eye on her.

646
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,820
Let her not say anything.

647
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,820
Nothing.
