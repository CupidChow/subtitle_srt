00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 03

3
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,320
=Jinzhenhe Tavern

4
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,440
Waiter, what happened?

5
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,880
How can you suddenly run out of room?

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,470
Sir.

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,040
This is not our intention at all.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,920
Today

9
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,880
here suddenly came an influential Childe.

10
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,600
He booked the whole tavern

11
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,320
and drove everyone out, except his people.

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,240
Sir, I'm sorry but I assume

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,920
it's better to find another tavern.

14
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,640
Waiter!

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Oh, Misses.

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
According to your order

17
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,760
all rooms have been tidied.

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,600
And we have also sent other guests away.

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
Please take these perfume bags.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
And put them in our Childe Jin's room.

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,680
With chopped herbs inside

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,160
they can keep mosquitoes at bay.

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Mianmian, how considerate you are!

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
No wonder our Childe favors you.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,640
Stop that.

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,240
You shall be careful of this matter

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
taking the renown of our Childe into account.

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Please rest assured. I fully understand.

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,560
Let's go

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
to see our Childe's room.

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
Please go this way, Misses.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,920
I see. They are the Jin clan of Lanling.

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,760
They must be here for the lecture too

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,640
and taking a rest in Caiyi town.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,360
Brother,

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
such a few people of Jin clan

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
occupy the whole tavern

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
and want to drive us away despite the sequence.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,760
But there is no vacant tavern left in the town.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
We have no choice.

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,000
Lady Mianmian!

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,640
May I have one of your perfume bags?

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,200
Who are you?

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
Who gave you the right to call me Mianmian?

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,600
It's her.

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,960
She may call you Mianmian.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,280
Why can't I?

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,120
Who on earth are you?

49
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,360
Don't call me like that!

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
All right.

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,360
What about you telling me your true name?

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
Then I won't call you Mianmain.

53
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Why should I tell you as you ask?

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
You should say your own name

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,480
before asking somebody else's name.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,760
That's easy.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
I'll say, keep it in mind.

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
My name is Yuandao.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Yuandao...

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,880
Mianmian

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,360
I can't remember which clan's childe bears this name.

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
But judging from his look and demeanor

63
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
he's not like a nobody.

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,880
You...

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,840
You teased  me!

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,240
What happened?

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,440
Think about the poetry.

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
What's next to "green, green,the riverside grass"

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Green, green, the riverside grass

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,800
Long, long, missing that far road.
(also can be seen as "Mianmian misses Yuandao" )

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,760
Don't speak that out!

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
Who misses you?

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
How shameless.

74
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,360
Say, Lady Mainmian, you come from Jin clan of Lanling, right?

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,320
People say girls from Jin clan are all pretty as fairies.

76
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
Now that I have seen one

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,320
I can't agree more.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,960
Glib-tongued.

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,200
I am Wei Ying from Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,200
My courtesy name is Wuxian.

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
We're going to the Lan clan of Gusu for the lecture

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
and taking a rest in Caiyi town.

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,640
As fellow cultivators,

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,960
Lady Mianmian won't bear to see us sleep out on the streets.

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
So, Mr. Yuandao

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,640
you do have a decent name.

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,160
However...

88
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
as for the rooms...

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,600
Mianmian,

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
our Childe won't bring so many people here anyway.

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
These rooms are vacant for nothing.

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,280
Not to mention they arrived earlier.

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,200
Such being the case,

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
Childe Wei, you and your party may stay.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,560
And I won't bother our Childe with this matter.

96
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Ladies, much obliged.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
Only a frivolous playboy like you

98
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,600
can take the rooms back from those girls.

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
Senior Sister,

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,080
listen to what he said!

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,600
Jiang Cheng,

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,680
I'll generouly take that

103
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,960
as your envy and jealousy of me.

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
How about you two fighting it out here and now?

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,920
But, senior sister,

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
who is the Childe Jin Mianmian mentioned?

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Who else could it be?

108
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,600
Approximate age as us

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,760
and a Jin clan.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
If it's not the youngest Childe, Jin Zixuan

111
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,040
who else could it be?

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
I just wonder if such Childe Jin

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
is still fancy like he was

114
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,490
when he was a child.

115
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,400
Lady and gentlemen,

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm terribly sorry but

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,720
there aren't enough rooms.

118
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Please empty these rooms as well.

119
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,360
Childe Jin.

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,520
This is the best tavern in the Caiyi town?

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
Yes, Childe.

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,920
Still no comparison to Jinlintai even as the best.

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,080
As for the chair,

124
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,080
we Jin clan make them out of black sandalwood.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,000
As for the teacup,

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
we adopt only peacock green glaze porcelain.

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,930
The tea is stale.

128
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,640
= Jin Zixuan from Jin clan of Lanling =
The tea is stale.

129
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,530
= Jin Zixuan from Jin clan of Lanling =

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's go check the rooms.

131
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,480
This way, Childe.

132
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Jiang clan of Yunmeng, pleased to see you.

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I suppose junior Childe Jin

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,760
is also going to Lan clan of Gusu as an auditor, right?

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,600
Watch your manner!

136
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,760
Our childe is Childe Jin

137
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
not junior Childe Jin.

138
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,400
Childe Jiang is also passing by this place?

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
Yes, we need to take a rest here.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,920
Unfortunately

141
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,800
every room in this tavern has been booked

142
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,600
by us Jin clan of Lanling

143
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,030
You guys better go elsewhere.

144
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,030
Hey,

145
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,840
but we arrived earlier.

146
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,030
You are earlier, so what?

147
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,080
You should go complain to the owner.

148
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,240
Anyway, we have booked the whole tavern.

149
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,160
Our Childe would rather not

150
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,280
have association with some random folks.

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,960
As for the lecture of Lan clan

152
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,680
only a few quotas available for each clan.

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,560
Junior Childe Jin, you brought out a grand display

154
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
with so many people.

155
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,200
What's your purpose?

156
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,600
We're Childe Jin's servants. What's wrong?

157
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,000
So it's real that the Jin clan is ostentatious.

158
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,160
But I heard

159
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,960
the Lan clan is strict and puritanical.

160
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,000
Junior Childe Jin

161
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,120
takes so many retinues.

162
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm really afraid

163
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
that you couldn't stand that kind of suffering.

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Xian.

165
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Senior Sister.

166
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,160
I'm just providing

167
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,920
a friendly suggestion.

168
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,920
How dare you insult our Childe!

169
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Where is the manner of Jiang clan?

170
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,720
What insult?

171
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,800
Name it.

172
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,880
And

173
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,920
you can confront me

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,320
but don't involve Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

175
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,560
Xian, Cheng.

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
Go pack up.

177
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,200
We'll find another place.

178
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Goodbye, Childe Jin.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,560
Childe.

180
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,120
Your room is the next one.

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
Forgive me, Miss Jiang.

182
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm mistaken about the room

183
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,440
No offence.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,440
You are too modest to say that.

185
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,480
Isn't the whole tavern yours?

186
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,680
It's said that the etiquette of Jin clan is of high reputation.

187
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,225
Now I can say just so so.

188
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,840
This Jin Zixuan,

189
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
how arrogant he is!

190
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah.

191
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,480
He is flaunting just like a peacock.

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,400
It's a pity that

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,840
I couldn't even touch the pot of  Emperor's Smile.

194
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,240
Look at our situation.

195
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,440
You're still thinking about liquor?

196
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Can't you see the look on senior sister'face?

197
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,400
I just don't know what Uncle Jiang was thinking.

198
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
Why did he arrange marriage

199
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
between senior sister and that peacock?

200
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,160
According to Lan clan's principles

201
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,520
everyone coming for the lecture

202
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,520
is not allowed in without an invitation.

203
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
Oh, buddy,

204
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,200
I've told you a thousand times.

205
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,520
We accidentally got our invitations lost.

206
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,120
We never intended to lose it.

207
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,080
What's more.

208
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,200
All of us are standing here.

209
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
What can we lie to you?

210
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,400
Sir,

211
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,360
without an invitation,

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,040
I can't identify you people.

213
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,480
Look, sun is about to set.

214
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,320
You can't just watch us sleeping out on the streets,

215
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,000
can you?

216
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,400
How about this.

217
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
Please go fetch your clan leader.

218
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
He had seen our senior sister.

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,600
At sight of her

220
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,480
he will know we're talking honestly.

221
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,840
Well then, please wait here for a moment

222
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,120
until we change shifts when it's 17:45.

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
17:45?

224
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560
The sun has already set then.

225
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,440
Xian.

226
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
Behave yourself.

227
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,480
But senior sister...

228
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
As father instructed

229
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
no matter when

230
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,320
we can't forget our manners.

231
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
Let's leave the gate and plan for the next step.

232
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,630
= Lan Zhan, courtesy name is Wangji =

233
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,720
Second Childe, welcome back.

234
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
Who are looking for trouble?

235
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,720
This Second Childe of Lan

236
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,480
must be Lan Wangji, one of the twin jades of Lan,

237
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,600
and the younger brother of their clan leader Lan Xichen.

238
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,880
He must be our key to get in.

239
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,600
What happened?

240
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,440
Just carry him inside.

241
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,400
How can he end up like this?

242
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,280
End?

243
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
He's not dead if I say.

244
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,800
He's more like cursed by some wicked sorcery.

245
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
Wicked sorcery?

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Second Childe Lan

247
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I am Jiang Cheng from Jiang clan of Yunmeng,

248
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,680
son of our clan leader Jiang Fengmian.

249
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,240
This is my sister,  Jiang Yanli.

250
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:01,355
My senior brother, Wei Ying, also called Wei Wuxian.

251
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,280
Second Childe Lan, we've heard much about you.

252
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,720
My honor.

253
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,760
Second Childe Lan,

254
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,160
we accidentally got our invitation lost.

255
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
It's getting late and inconvenient to sleep outside.

256
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
Please make a merciful exception for us.

257
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
No invitation, no entry.

258
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,200
Second Childe Lan,

259
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,760
we come all the way from Yunmeng.

260
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,480
Despite the exhausting travel

261
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
we finally made it before sunset

262
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,040
to the Cloud Recesses.

263
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
You just turn us down for an invitation.

264
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,370
Don't you think it's a little rigid?

265
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,080
No invitation, no entry.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Second Childe Lan,

267
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
it was an accident.

268
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,680
We never intended to lose it.

269
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,880
Please make an exception.

270
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,960
Find it and come back.

271
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,080
Second Childe Lan,

272
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,960
sun is about to set,

273
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,040
while we are more than 20 miles away from Caiyi town.

274
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,600
You ask us to find it now.

275
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
What an imposition!

276
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,880
Second Childe Lan,

277
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
in the worst case we can...

278
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,280
Second Childe has put silencing charm on you.

279
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,840
No one can relieve it except the Lan.

280
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
And it dispels automatically

281
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,200
after a stick of incense time.

282
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,400
How inflexible the Second Childe Lan is.

283
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Yeah.

284
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,200
So much fuss about the Cloud Recesses.

285
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,160
Yunmeng is much better.

286
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,200
Tell me about it.

287
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,080
I'd rather not be here.

288
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,800
Sis,

289
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,320
don't you worry.

290
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,520
He just went back to the tavern for the invitation.

291
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,760
Everything will be fine.

292
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I just worry...

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,350
Sis,

294
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,920
Jin Zixuan

295
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,280
is typical of his kind.

296
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,880
Don't worry too much.

297
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,040
I do not.

298
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,040
I just worry that Childe Jin will embarrass Xian

299
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
for his character.

300
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,040
As long as he stay fine with others,

301
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,480
nobody will embarrass him.

302
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
It's hard to say he is not having fun with some Mianmian

303
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,520
or some Yuandao now.

304
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,160
Cheng,

305
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,240
you know that Xian always takes it seriously,

306
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,720
when it's important.

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Second Childe Lan.

308
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,160
Senior Sister!

309
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,160
Cheng!

310
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
Where is everybody?

311
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,620
No wonder nobody's here.

312
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,440
Wards are used to be broken.

313
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,920
What a coincidence! We meet again.

314
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,040
Se...Second Childe Lan. You come out at this late night.

315
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,360
Are you coming to admire the moon?

316
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Second Childe Lan,

317
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,000
I come for my senior sister.

318
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,280
Oh right.

319
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,720
I found that invitation.

320
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Right here.

321
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,320
I'll show you.

322
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,760
Breaking  through wards.

323
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,200
A violation of Lan clan principles.

324
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
Who comes at night should not be allowed in till 7:00.

325
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,040
Two violations of Lan clan principles.

326
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,160
Unauthorized carrying of liquor.

327
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,160
Three violations of Lan clan principles.

328
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,920
Second Childe Lan,

329
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,960
I...

330
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,400
am new here in your Lan clan of Gusu

331
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,840
and not familiar with many rules.

332
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,280
But I swear

333
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
such things won't happen again.

334
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,120
What's more. I was just in a hurry

335
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,920
to find my senior sister and Cheng.

336
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,360
How about this.

337
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,080
You just let me in for a glimpse.

338
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,240
Just one glimpse.

339
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Well then.

340
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,280
The Emperor's Smile.

341
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,640
I spare you one pot.

342
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,360
Forget about these, deal?

343
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,920
Attempt to bribe law enforcer.

344
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Doubly guilty.

345
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,040
Second Childe Lan.

346
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,120
Are you seriously so inflexible?

347
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,520
When we were at the gate

348
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
you put silencing charm on me of no reason.

349
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:29,205
You are somehow responsible for that case, right?

350
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,640
I didn't expect that fuddy-duddy had real skill.

351
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm occupied today.

352
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,720
Excuse me.

353
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,920
Lan Zhan!

354
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Pay for my Emperor's Smile!

355
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,560
Turn around.

356
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,080
What's this?

357
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,160
Lan clan of Gusu principles.

358
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,440
This much?

359
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,440
Put it down.

360
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,760
Since you came for the lecture,

361
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
let's count how many principles you have violated tonight.

362
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,480
Well,

363
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,640
I'm so fortunate that

364
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,360
I haven't been born in stiff and horrible Lan clan of Gusu.

365
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,920
Liquor is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses.

366
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,400
Well, I can stay outside

367
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,680
and sit here to drink.

368
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,240
This won't count, right?

369
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,480
Recalcitrant.

370
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,280
The female cultivators in every clan

371
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,440
is all admiring the famous Second Childe Lan.

372
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,760
What a pity.

373
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,040
Pity?

374
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
What a pity that they don't know

375
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
the person they are admiring

376
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,640
is a relentless unreasonable

377
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,280
and rigid guy.

378
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,080
But it doesn't matter.

379
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
When I go back to Yunmeng,

380
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
I'm going to...

381
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,920
Let's go.

382
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,360
Uncle

383
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,240
= Lan Huan, courtesy name is Xichen =

384
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,280
This man's death looks strange.
= Lan Huan, courtesy name is Xichen =

385
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,560
This man's death looks strange.

386
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,025
Nothing like this happened before.

387
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:01,480
Nothing like this happened before.
= Lan Qiren =

388
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,400
= Lan Qiren =

389
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,365
It looks like he was cursed by some wicked sorcery.
= Lan Qiren =

390
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,400
It looks like he was cursed by some wicked sorcery.

391
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,880
Wangji only brought one corpse back?

392
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,240
Clans around Gusu have reported lately.

393
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,840
They say there are cultivators going missing recently.

394
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
So I sent Wangji to investigate that.

395
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,120
This man is...

396
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,480
one of our disciples from outside families.

397
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Wicked sorcery.

398
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,480
Uncle.

399
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Who is making noises?

400
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,400
Big brother.

401
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,400
Childe Wei.

402
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,760
The Cloud Recesses is not like the Lotus Cove.

403
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,800
There are many rules indeed.

404
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,240
You are new here.

405
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,600
I can't blame the innocent.

406
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,760
But under no circumstance

407
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,600
can I defame our principles.

408
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,760
So the punishment

409
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,320
is inevitable.

410
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,720
As for how,

411
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,240
Wangji, it's up to you.

412
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,040
Transcribe the principles, 300 times.

413
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,280
Wangji,

414
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,800
just dispel the silencing charm on Childe Wei.

415
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,160
You fuddy-duddy!

416
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,480
Zewu Jun,

417
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,360
listen to me.

418
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
What Lan Zhan said is totally wrong.

419
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,640
He is such a dumb

420
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,880
if one word is enough he won't say two words.

421
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,680
Let me speak.

422
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,600
The truth is

423
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,040
my party and I arrived at dusk

424
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,480
at the gate of the Cloud Recesses

425
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,560
only to find our invitation was lost.

426
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,320
But actually it's not us to blame.

427
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,560
It's all that peacock Jin Zixuan's fault.

428
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,040
Anyway, we made it to the gate

429
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,040
and wasn't able to get in.

430
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,200
We had no choice.

431
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,760
So I went back for the invitation alone.

432
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,720
And the Emperor's Smile from Gusu is so well-known.

433
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,240
It's resonable that I bought two pots, is it?

434
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,000
However I couldn't even have one sip

435
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,240
before Lan Zhan broke one of them.

436
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,440
Before I could get my liquor compensated

437
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,680
you know what

438
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,280
he put silencing charm on me.

439
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,480
Childe Wei,

440
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,000
anyhow

441
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,200
you have violated our principles first.

442
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,600
So you can't blame Wangji for that.

443
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,080
What's more.

444
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,240
Lady and Childe Jiang have got in

445
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,200
all thanks to Wangji who just explained to me.

446
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,920
Brother.

447
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,640
My senior sister, they got in?

448
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
He let them in?

449
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,240
So you aren't that grim.

450
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,160
Hey, Lan Zhan, you serious?

451
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,560
I am sorry, OK?

452
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,640
Well, Childe Wei.

453
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,420
Since it was a misunderstanding

454
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,760
please go back and have a rest.

455
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,440
Zewu Jun,

456
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,680
is he dead?

457
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,880
Why covered with a white cloth?

458
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,400
What did you say?

459
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,600
am I wrong?

460
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,520
But when I was at the gate this afternoon

461
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
he was still alive.

462
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,520
The things I just told you

463
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,280
do you get them all?

464
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,400
= Wen Qing from Wen clan of Qishan =

465
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,320
Yes, Your Excellency.
= Wen Qing from Wen clan of Qishan =

466
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,850
= Wen Qing from Wen clan of Qishan =

467
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,840
I understand.

468
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll send Wen Chao with you.

469
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,520
He'll take you to the Cloud Recesses.

470
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,520
Everything after that

471
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,920
is up to you.

472
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Remember.

473
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
The shard of Yin Iron looks exactly the same as

474
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,240
the one in Dafan Mountain.

475
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,880
You could recognize it.

476
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,120
Find it and bring it here.

477
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,480
Your Excellency, I...

478
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,680
Speak.

479
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,880
Ning is frail and feeble since childhood.

480
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,680
May I take him with me?

481
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,080
You worry that he would be treated

482
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,680
unfairly in the Nevernight?

483
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,040
How dare I.

484
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,120
Whatever,

485
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,800
do what you want.

486
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,800
Ning Wen has a special constitution.

487
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,120
Maybe he could help you

488
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
when you do the investigation.

489
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,120
Thank you, Your Excellency.

490
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
Departure is tomorrow.

491
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,440
Off you go.

492
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,520
Understood.

493
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,720
You see.

494
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,160
He looks dead

495
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,640
and feels like a dead.

496
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,800
But he's still affected by the fluctuation of spiritual power.

497
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,360
He can't count as a true dead.

498
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,560
Nothing more than...

499
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,960
Than what?

500
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,800
It's hard to say.

501
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,400
But he seems to have lost the spiritual cognition.

502
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,040
Spirit snatch.

503
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,200
A puppet.

504
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,160
Yes.

505
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,800
He's like a puppet.

506
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,720
A manipulable puppet.

507
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,120
Wangji.

508
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,480
Big brother.

509
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,520
Wangji.

510
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,920
What's the matter?

511
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,760
About that puppet

512
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,000
brother and uncle seem preoccupied.

513
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,710
I just had a conversation with uncle.

514
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,280
Specific reason remains unknown but

515
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,320
we can preliminarily infer that

516
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,040
it should be caused by someone's trials of wicked sorcery.

517
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,760
If it is true

518
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,190
the culprit must be ambitious.

519
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
Cultivators going missing

520
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,150
may be just a start.

521
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,960
What's your plan, big brother?

522
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,880
For now we could only inspect around.

523
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,040
But what if...

524
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,920
Big brother.

525
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,080
Never mind.

526
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,720
Maybe I just think too much.

527
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,680
Wangji,

528
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,440
look into the missing case again.

529
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,600
But remember,

530
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
don't be reckless.

531
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,000
I know, please rest assured.

532
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,040
I am always assured of you.

533
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,360
Ever since our father's death

534
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,120
you are becoming more and more prudent.

535
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,120
I sometimes wonder

536
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,780
whether I have been too strict with you.

537
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
Brother has taken a lot of duties,

538
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,920
I'm just helping spare the burden.

539
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
It's good for you to be with me during the lecture.

540
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,920
Many disciples from different clans are at the same age as you.

541
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,080
It's time for you to make some friends.

542
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,040
I actually feel good about that Childe Wei.

543
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,560
Though he sometimes

544
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,080
does some excessive things.

545
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,160
He is smart

546
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,320
and has a lively and cheerful character.

547
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,640
Wangji

548
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
doesn't he have some real skills?

549
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
You two tied against each other?

550
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,170
= Xue Yang =

551
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,160
Xue Yang

552
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:08,960
= Wen Ruohan from Wen clan of Qishan =

553
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,360
What are you laughing at?
= Wen Ruohan from Wen clan of Qishan =

554
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,865
= Wen Ruohan from Wen clan of Qishan =

555
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:12,605
Your Excellency.

556
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,800
I'm just laughing because that

557
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,560
all these puppets are just a trial.

558
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,640
Yin Iron can do much more than this.

559
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,800
Is it?

560
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,280
If Your Excellency don't trust me

561
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
don't trust the power of Yin Iron

562
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,480
why did you bother to

563
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,360
snatch so many cultivators

564
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,880
to test this shard of Yin Iron?

565
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,920
Xue Yang,

566
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,360
you dare talk to me like that.

567
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,160
What a daredevil.

568
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,840
I don't fear death.

569
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,160
I fear boredom.

570
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,280
You help me find other three shards of Yin Iron

571
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,800
and subdue all other clans.

572
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,960
Then you can call your life worthwhile.

573
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,590
Please don't forget, Your Excellency.

574
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,760
I don't have the slightest interest in dominating others.

575
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,120
My request has been given

576
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,280
the first time I came to the Nevernight to see you.

577
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,720
I hope Your Excellency don't forget it.

578
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,360
Don't worry.

579
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,600
Once I've collected all four shards of Yin Iron

580
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,280
your wish will definitely be fulfilled.

581
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,800
Thank you in advance, Your Excellency.

582
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,320
Xue Yang.

583
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,720
West of Dafan, East of Gusu, North of Yueyang.

584
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,120
where is the last shard of Yin Iron?

585
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
Don't forget the promise between us, Your Excellency.

586
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,280
When Your Excellency ask me

587
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,880
to go to Chang clan of Yueyang for that shard of Yin Iron

588
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,280
I will tell you the last part then.
