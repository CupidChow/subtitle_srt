1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 24

3
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,310
- Yeah, it's a good thing. - Good thing indeed.

4
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,270
- Yeah. - Just grant it, Clan Leader Jiang.

5
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,110
Sister seems still attached to that peacock.

6
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,320
But the engagement was already called off.

7
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,520
Granting it now

8
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,030
will make it look like that Jiang clan are playing up to others.

9
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,830
Clan Leader Jin,

10
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,440
we appreciate your kindness.

11
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Clan Leader Jin.

12
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,320
Marriage is a life-long matter.

13
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,550
I assume that you should ask my senior sister first,

14
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,320
rather than ask Jiang Cheng directly.

15
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,520
Do you agree, Jiang Cheng?

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Wei Wuxian,

17
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,390
my uncle is talking to Clan Leader Jiang.

18
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,320
How dare you interrupt them!

19
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,750
Well.

20
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,630
You can ask Jiang Cheng yourself.

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Clan Leader Jin,

22
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,960
this indeed shouldn't be decided between two clans.

23
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
When my father was still alive,

24
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,160
he had the same thought.

25
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,000
Anyway we should leave the decision to my sister.

26
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,110
It shouldn't be

27
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,000
meddled by others.

28
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,670
You are right.

29
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,270
As for this,

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,110
we should listen to lady Jiang's opinion.

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Senior sister.

32
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,270
I'm much grateful for your kindness,

33
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,000
Clan Leader Jiang.

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,440
But Jiang clan has just gone through a havoc.

35
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,880
As a disciple of Jiang clan,

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,510
I should think more about the whole clan,

37
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,160
and ought to return to Yunmeng and rebuild Lotus Cove.

38
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,920
For now,

39
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,040
it's not a good timing for me to get married.

40
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,070
Clan Leader Jin,

41
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,160
please excuse me.

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,440
This is...

43
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,950
Father.

44
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,320
Dear friends,

45
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,670
Jiang's ancestors and the departed Clan Leader Jiang

46
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,550
would be satisfied for having such an excellent daughter.

47
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,270
Actually, not only Jiang clan,

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,320
all major clans suffered a loss

49
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,110
because of the campaign against Wen clan.

50
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,160
At the moment,

51
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,160
everything needs to be revived and talents are in shortage.

52
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,230
Sounds rather sensible.

53
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,110
- I agree. - He's quite right.

54
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,000
His words make sense.

55
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,920
Recently, father has been troubled by this.

56
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Fortunately, a viable scheme came into being.

57
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,270
Please forgive my impudence.

58
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,790
But on behalf of my father,

59
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,760
I want to invite everyone to Jinlintai this fall.

60
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,440
Jin clan will do our best to hold again

61
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,230
the Phoenix Mountain Crowd Hunt.

62
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,230
Phoenix Mountain Crowd Hunt?

63
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,230
Not anyone can afford

64
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,550
to hold the crowd hunt.

65
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah,

66
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,670
it's so generous

67
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,270
for Jin clan to address all clans' urgent need now.

68
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,670
What a charitable deed!

69
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,480
I totally agree.

70
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,070
That's right.

71
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,760
So dear friends, please make sure your participation then.

72
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,070
Thanks, Clan Leader Jin.

73
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,350
So kind is Clan Leader Jin.

74
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,790
To Clan Leader Jin!

75
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,830
- OK. - Cheers.

76
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,390
- To Clan Leader Jin! - Right.

77
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,070
Cheers.

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,920
Please.

79
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,550
Let's drink.

80
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,110
Nice liquor.

81
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,720
Toast to you.

82
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,600
Thanks.

83
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,440
Father.

84
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,480
All left?

85
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,950
Yes.

86
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,270
Well done!

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,830
Thank you for your hard working.

88
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,760
My pleasure.

89
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,440
Sharing father's worries

90
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,510
is part of my duty.

91
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,110
Have you gotten a lead on Yin Iron?

92
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
Not yet.

93
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,880
Please forgive my incapacity.

94
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,880
However...

95
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,550
What?

96
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,710
When I was in Nevernight,

97
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,590
Wen Ruohan told me that

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,520
the last shard of Yin Iron is on Xue Yang's hands.

99
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,760
If my memory doesn't go wrong,

100
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,910
you had met Xue Yang

101
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
when you were still assisting Nie clan?

102
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,670
Yes.

103
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,230
But Yin Iron hadn't been be found

104
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,960
either in Chang clan or on Xue Yang.

105
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,110
Nevertheless...

106
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,400
Make it straightforward.

107
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,710
Yes, father.

108
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,910
There is another possibility

109
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,320
that someone had taken the shard of Yin Iron

110
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,150
from Xue Yang at that time.

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,470
Do you remember

112
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,590
who had spent some time with Xue Yang alone?

113
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,840
Besides me,

114
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,910
it's only Childe Wei.

115
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,440
Wei Ying?

116
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,790
Wei Wuxian?

117
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
Wei Wuxian...

118
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,470
Wei Wuxian...

119
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,000
Father.

120
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,230
Since Childe Wei was merely

121
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,110
watching over Xue Yang at that time,

122
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,790
and he has an intimate relationship with Second Childe Lan,

123
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,230
I suppose he wouldn't have done such a thing.

124
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,470
Moreover,

125
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,550
Stygian Tiger Amulet though resembles Yin Iron,

126
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,280
they two aren't necessarily related.

127
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
Wei Wuxian.

128
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,760
Where are he and his fellows?

129
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,150
Childe Wei and Clan Leader Jiang had left just now.

130
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,910
Yin Iron is intelligent and powerful,

131
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,520
so people in the world should repress it.

132
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,590
There are four shards of Yin Iron in the world.

133
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,350
Three of them

134
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,080
fell into Wen's hands.

135
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
The last one

136
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,440
is missing along with Xue Yang's missing.

137
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
What a coincidence

138
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,550
that Xue Yang disappeared

139
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,470
while Wei Wuxian came back with a Stygian Tiger Amulet.

140
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,110
Yao,

141
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,440
since you has just came back,

142
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,710
go to Jinlintai and pay a visit to Host Madam.

143
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,790
Understood.

144
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,790
As for Wei Ying...

145
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,840
Please rest assured, father.

146
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,350
I'll send someone to spy on him.

147
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
Archer

148
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,230
shall grab the bow and pull the string to shoot,

149
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,670
shall relax the shoulders and tighten the arm,

150
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,230
and shall wait for the right time.

151
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,150
It's the way not to miss even one arrow.

152
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,200
Big brother.

153
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,790
According to the disciples,

154
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,880
Hanguang Jun went to the Library Pavilion

155
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,470
the moment he came back,

156
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,320
took away many music scores

157
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,200
and focused on playing night and day.

158
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,080
So I came to check if it's true.

159
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,150
Big brother.

160
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,080
I want to enter the forbidden chamber of Library Pavilion.

161
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,400
For what?

162
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,520
Study music scores.

163
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,880
Zewu Jun, Hanguang Jun.

164
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,560
Master Lan asked you to go there.

165
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,190
Let's go.

166
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,710
Cleanse resent?

167
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes.

168
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,000
I wasn't there

169
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,040
when you made your fierce attack on Qishan.

170
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,430
But to a certain extent, I know how tragic

171
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,400
the last battle was.

172
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,800
I've also heard about Wei Ying.

173
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,400
When nest falls,

174
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,280
no egg will survive.

175
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,230
Now there are corpses all over the place.

176
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,800
It will easily beget the evil.

177
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,830
Plus

178
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,640
Wen clan was leading such a wicked cultivation.

179
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,640
If it isn't cleansed in time,

180
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,800
there will be unimaginable outcome.

181
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,800
Yes, uncle.

182
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
Uncle.

183
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,470
Wangji.

184
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,470
You don't need to accompany Xichen this time.

185
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,070
You have another assignment.

186
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,950
That day

187
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,350
Xichen left with our collected books.

188
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,880
It's hard to avoid missing or damaging some in a rush.

189
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Now mending collected books

190
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,710
and disciplines of Lan

191
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
is of first priority.

192
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,110
There is no order without rules.

193
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,230
Disciplines are the foundation of us Lan clan.

194
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,400
I hope you won't forget that.

195
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,310
Uncle.

196
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,880
I want to enter the forbidden chamber.

197
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,430
Have you finished all books in Library Pavilion?

198
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,430
Uncle,

199
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,280
I want to enter the forbidden chamber.

200
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,830
If not,

201
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,590
no need to enter there.

202
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,190
Wangji,

203
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,950
do you know

204
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,710
why I don't let you leave with Xichen?

205
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,190
Leave now.

206
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,400
I, Jiang Cheng,

207
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,760
as the son of Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan,

208
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,470
from now on

209
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,160
officially succeed as Clan Leader of Jiang clan.

210
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,040
The discipline of Jiang clan

211
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,470
is to try something impossible to be done.

212
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,070
As long as I still get my breath,

213
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,520
I'll devote to the core value of our clan.

214
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,880
I won't allow another disaster happening to Jiang clan again.

215
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,880
Clan Leader Jiang.

216
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
= Chapter of Conduct =

217
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,540
= Eradicate the evil, set up laws, and then goodness is everlasting. =

218
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,160
One!

219
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,160
A bit higher.

220
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,230
Two!

221
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,430
Three!

222
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,310
Use your wrist.

223
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
You're using your arm.

224
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,280
Four!

225
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,070
This is your strength?

226
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,590
How can you practice sword if you can't hold it steadily?

227
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,800
Clan Leader.

228
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,560
Clan Leader, this is the entrance letter from the clan of Ezhou.

229
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,190
Two!

230
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,160
= A letter asking for entrance =

231
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,950
Three!
= A letter asking for entrance =

232
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,560
= A letter asking for entrance =

233
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,400
Four!

234
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm not available now.

235
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Go to Wei Wuxian.

236
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,710
Se... Senior brother is

237
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,070
not in Lotus Cove.

238
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Once again?

239
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,880
He went to the town again?

240
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,110
Four!

241
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,350
Cheng.

242
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,070
Sister.

243
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,920
One!

244
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,400
I'll be there in a moment.

245
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,520
You go serve the tea.

246
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,640
Don't slight our guests.

247
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,190
Understood.

248
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Three!

249
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,350
Lotus Cove has been rebuilt,

250
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
but everything changed.

251
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,640
Maybe he is

252
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,950
just not used to it.

253
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,070
Not used to it?

254
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,350
Am I used to it?

255
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,880
He's just used to being unruly at home.

256
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,590
So much for helping me revive Jiang clan, huh?

257
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,190
I can't see his efforts or attitude at all.

258
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,800
Cheng.

259
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,710
Four!

260
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,760
- One! - Use your wrist!

261
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,830
Hand higher!

262
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,680
Two!

263
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Three!

264
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,880
Zewu Jun.

265
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,110
What a coincidence!

266
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,520
Childe Wei, pleasant to meet you.

267
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,070
How come Zewu Jun has some spare time to be in Yunmeng?

268
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,560
If not in a rush,

269
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,830
let's have a drink together?

270
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,640
Oh, I forgot.

271
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,230
Lan clan are forbidden to drink.

272
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,070
Not exactly.

273
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,760
Zewu Jun, you really can drink!

274
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,830
Comparing with Lan Zhan,

275
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,350
you're so distinct.

276
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,000
It can't be...

277
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,560
It can't be that Zewu Jun drinks secretly

278
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,640
in Cloud Recesses just like me, right?

279
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,880
Zewu Jun.

280
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,560
That's ill-considered. Sorry.

281
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,950
Actually, I get rid of the alcohol by using golden core.

282
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,230
So this can't be counted as drinking.

283
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,710
Zewu Jun, you are such a capable gentelman.

284
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,400
But Zewu Jun,

285
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,430
cleansing resent should be

286
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,280
the interest of Lan Zhan.

287
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Why didn't he come along?

288
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,710
He is ordered to stay home

289
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,230
and mend our family disciplines.

290
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,950
More than three thousand disciplines.

291
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,110
Zewu Jun,

292
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,430
this is such an unbearable task.

293
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,400
Mending so many disciplines.

294
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,070
Isn't it the same as being imprisoned?

295
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,430
He might be constrained in the mountain for three years!

296
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,920
Well then.

297
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,920
I've been idle recently.

298
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,520
In a couple of days,

299
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,470
I go with you to Cloud Recesses to visit him.

300
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,040
Back then

301
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,710
I was watched over by him to transcribe disciplines in Library Pavilion.

302
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,590
Now I can be in his position.

303
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,950
It seems more fun.

304
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,470
If Childe Wei would come to Gusu,

305
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,400
how about listen to several pieces of music Wangji newly learned.

306
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,520
They all can clear up your mind and help you concentrate.

307
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,430
What's your intention in saying it, Zewu Jun?

308
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,040
Wangji is learning "Absterge" lately.

309
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,110
I wonder if Childe Wei knows his intention?

310
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,680
Zewu Jun deliberately came to Yunmeng to persuade me?

311
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,920
Then you did it under someone's requirement.

312
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,040
Zewu Jun,

313
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,800
are people in Lan clan

314
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,070
so fond of meddling?

315
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,520
Wangji is my brother.

316
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,710
I know his thoughts well.

317
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,710
No matter Childe Wei listen or not,

318
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,760
I have a few words to express.

319
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,880
There are set rules in the world, and goodness is with regulations.

320
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
If Childe Wei

321
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,470
were the only one in the world,

322
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,400
you surely can do whatever at your will.

323
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,070
But unfortunately,

324
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,590
everyone has a tongue in the world.

325
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,110
I hope Childe Wei shall not be so self-centered

326
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,830
that people caring about you are affected by it.

327
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,070
If you trust me and Wangji,

328
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,280
we Lan clan of Gusu can help you pick up your sword arts again.

329
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
I trust you.

330
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,950
But I don't want to pick it up.

331
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,110
Childe Wei.

332
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,310
Wicked tricks harm your temperament. Tiger Amulet is hard to control.

333
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,070
If your mind is completely lost, it will cause...

334
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,880
But I still want to give it a shot.

335
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,590
Maybe

336
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,230
I am the prodigy.

337
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,400
Jiang Cheng, still awake?

338
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,830
Perfect. I brought you liquor.

339
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,430
Piss off.

340
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
For what, you are scrubbing your sword

341
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,640
all day long?

342
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
How many times

343
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,000
shall you scrub your sword for a day?

344
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,190
Where's yours?

345
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,310
How long ago did you scrub it?

346
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,430
Left in my room.

347
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,160
One time a month should do.

348
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,230
Not carrying a sword in public.

349
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,520
Drinking in a tavern all day.

350
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,800
Someone must presume that

351
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,950
Lotus Cove is the inn where you can rest when you've drunk enough.

352
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,400
Don't be so mad, Jiang Cheng.

353
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,350
Go away.

354
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,110
Are you fine?

355
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,470
Too drunk

356
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,520
to manage your spiritual power?

357
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
Look at yourself.

358
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,110
Saying something about reviving Jiang clan with me.

359
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,430
Stay there.

360
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,350
What do you mean?

361
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,110
Want a fight?

362
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm tired.

363
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,880
We can fight tomorrow.

364
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,230
I'll go sleep.

365
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,800
Senior sister.

366
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,310
Xian.

367
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,040
Come here.

368
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,830
Didn't you

369
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,590
quarrel with Cheng again?

370
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,350
I've got used to quarreling with him.

371
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,560
Not a big deal. We'll be fine in two days.

372
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,640
Don't worry.

373
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,470
Xian,

374
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
are you...

375
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,710
are you tired of staying in Lotus Cove?

376
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,520
What are you talking about, senior sister?

377
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,000
Lotus Cove is my home.

378
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,160
If I don't stay here,

379
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,950
where else you think I can go?

380
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,560
I didn't mean that.

381
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,800
I was just afraid...

382
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,950
Senior sister.

383
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,190
If uncle Jiang

384
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,400
hadn't adopted me at that time,

385
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm afraid I'd still be begging along streets.

386
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,920
No matter what happens,

387
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,470
I won't leave Lotus Cove

388
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,710
and definitely won't leave you and Jiang Cheng.

389
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,280
Senior sister,

390
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,590
I know

391
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,800
I've been so reckless recently.

392
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,710
I'll change. I won't do it again.

393
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,350
Please don't be mad with me.

394
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,800
You little fool.

395
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,920
How can I be mad with you?

396
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,230
Don't you

397
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,110
remember that

398
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,230
when we were little?

399
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,710
I don't

400
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,160
but I remember what senior sister has told me.

401
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,920
Go somewhere else.

402
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,640
Away. Away. Away.

403
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,040
Where did this little beggar come from?

404
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,230
Decorated umbrella.

405
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,400
Decorated umbrella.

406
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,880
Wei Ying?

407
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,430
Wei Ying,

408
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,590
how about going back home with uncle?

409
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,310
You're born with a smiling face.

410
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,830
Always smiling.

411
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,040
Never mind too much about any sorrowful things.

412
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,590
No matter how worse a situation you're in,

413
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,040
you can always be happy.

414
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,230
Only with that kind of temperament

415
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
can you stand Cheng's bad temper.

416
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,710
Senior sister,

417
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,800
I don't have a good temper at all.

418
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,710
It's actually because of you.

419
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,560
If not for your sake,

420
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,280
I would have been beaten to death

421
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,670
hundreds of times by Jiang Cheng.

422
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,710
Silly you.

423
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,190
Don't judge from Cheng's look.

424
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,870
In fact,

425
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,760
he cares much about you in his heart.

426
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,630
Now

427
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,360
our parents are gone.

428
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,600
We are the closest three

429
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,630
in the world.

430
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,280
Senior sister,

431
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,670
I'm hungry.

432
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Why still act like a child?

433
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,520
I'm three this year.

434
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,950
Right, senior sister.

435
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,710
I have a question which I've been holding for long.

436
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,230
Then ask.

437
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,870
Why would a person

438
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,630
like another person?

439
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,390
I mean that kind of like.

440
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,320
Why suddenly ask this?

441
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,950
Do you have someone in heart?

442
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,470
No, no, no. Senior sister.

443
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,560
I haven't got one.

444
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,230
At least,

445
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,800
no need to like a person that much.

446
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,470
Isn't that like haltering

447
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,230
your own neck?

448
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,950
Three years old is exaggerating.

449
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
You're about one year old.

450
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,040
No, I'm three!

451
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,670
Three-year-old Xianxian is hungry.

452
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,560
There is soup in the kitchen.

453
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,560
Go have some.

454
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,600
Just don't know whether one-year-old Xianxian

455
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,280
can reach the cooking bench.

456
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,670
If I can't,

457
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,870
I have my senior sister here to hold me up.

458
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,390
You talk nonsense again.

459
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,910
Hey!

460
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,670
Isn't it shameful for a grown-up

461
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,870
to eavesdrop others' talk?

462
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,230
I didn't.

463
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,910
Now I own the whole Lotus Cove,

464
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,040
I can be wherever I want.

465
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
You can't stop me.

466
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,040
Senior sister just told me

467
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,280
she made lotus root and rib soup for me.

468
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,760
Where is that?

469
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,040
Finished up.

470
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,320
Only lotus roots left.

471
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,600
Go fetch it if you want.

472
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,600
You'd better throw it up!

473
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,560
I can throw it up.

474
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,710
But you have to eat it if I do.

475
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,360
OK.

476
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,520
Just do it. Throw it up.

477
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,710
There, there. You two.

478
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,760
How old are you?

479
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,150
Quarreling over some ribs.

480
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,840
I'll make another pot.

481
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,870
Cheng,

482
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,320
didn't you lose your demeanor as clan leader?

483
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,840
Right, do you still remember

484
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,910
you siad that

485
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,360
when I became the clan leader,

486
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,600
you'd assist me with all your heart

487
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,000
just like your father assisting my father.

488
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
Of course I do.

489
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,390
There's Jade Twin in Gusu.

490
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,520
We are the Pride Twin in Yunmeng then.

491
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't drag me down.

492
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,950
When did I?

493
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,230
OK there. I go make you soup.

494
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,630
Right,

495
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,950
in a month,

496
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,470
it'll be the Phoenix Mountain Crowd Hunt.

497
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,520
This is the first crowd hunt

498
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,760
of all clans after Sunshot Campaign.

499
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,430
You'd better behave yourself after we are in Lanling.

500
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Especially stay clear of Jin Zixuan.

501
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,630
He's the only son of Jin Guangshan after all.

502
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,600
Their future successor.

503
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,760
Their future clan leader.

504
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,870
As a clan leader, what should I do

505
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,560
if you two started fighting?

506
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,600
Should I help you fight him?

507
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,840
Or should I punish you?

508
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,870
There came another Jin Guangyao, isn't it?

509
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,320
I didn't contact with him much.

510
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,870
But from my perspective,

511
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,080
he is a much more pleasant person than that peacock.

512
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,360
Pleasant means little.

513
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,390
No matter how pleasant and smart he is,

514
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,040
he could only be a myrmidon in charge of greeting guests.

515
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,800
He won't go any further in his whole life.

516
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,230
He's no comparison with Jin Zixuan.

517
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,870
Jiang Cheng, I ask you.

518
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,630
What were you thinking

519
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,950
when we were in Nevernight?

520
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,040
You really wanted senior sister and he...

521
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,000
Not unacceptable.

522
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,760
Not unacceptable?

523
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,470
Don't you know what

524
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,230
he did during Sunshot Campaign?

525
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,360
You're telling me "not unacceptable" now?

526
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,080
He probably has regretted it.

527
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
Who cares if he regretted or not?

528
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,760
Do you have to forgive when an apology came?

529
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,230
Besides,

530
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,470
look at his father

531
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,910
fooling around with many women.

532
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,080
Maybe he will go after his father

533
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,870
hanging out with women everywhere.

534
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,910
If senior sister were with him,

535
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,710
can you stand that?

536
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,710
How dare him.

537
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,280
But,

538
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,670
the decision whether he is forgiven or not

539
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,280
shouldn't be made by us.

540
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,710
Sister likes him after all.

541
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,560
I just can't understand.

542
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,000
Why senior sister chose to like this pea...

543
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,720
= Library Pavilion =

544
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,390
Strange.

545
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,520
I have locked it up this morning.

546
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,150
No one is there.

547
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,800
Maybe I didn't lock it well?

548
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,000
Sizheng,

549
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,040
please don't report this to Hanguang Jun.

550
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,360
Look at that.

551
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,520
Slowly. Don't rush.

552
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,150
You hit me!

553
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,870
Ha, missed!

554
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,760
Slow down.

555
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,760
Watch out!

556
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,040
It seems not so hard to

557
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,670
go back to old days.
