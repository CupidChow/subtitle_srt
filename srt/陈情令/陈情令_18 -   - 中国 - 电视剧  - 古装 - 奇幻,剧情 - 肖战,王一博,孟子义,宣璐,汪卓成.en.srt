00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 18

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,240
You know Jiang Cheng.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
He's a naturally ambitious person,

5
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
focus too much on gain and loss.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,440
The cultivation is his life.

7
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,400
If he can only be

8
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,480
a mediocre people,

9
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,320
the rest of his life will be ruined.

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,320
And what about you?

11
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,200
Sis.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,760
I can only assure you of fifty percent chance.

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Fifty percent is OK.

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
At least it's half chance to succeed.

15
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,240
Thank goodness. Childe Jiang can be saved.

16
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,800
Thank you.

17
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
No rabbit, but a chicken will do.

18
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,200
Song Lan?!

19
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
What happened to his eyes?

20
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,920
Why is he here?

21
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,880
Let me do it.

22
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,200
You take a rest.

23
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm alright.

24
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,400
Did he wake up?

25
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, he just woke up.

26
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Miss Wen is examining his wounds.

27
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Is he all right?

28
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

29
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,480
But...

30
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,040
Don't worry.

31
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,200
He'll recover in a few days.

32
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,440
Bro Song, have some medicinal concoction first.

33
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,080
Childe Wei.

34
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,440
I didn't expect to meet you here.

35
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
I wanted to ask you, too.

36
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,600
How did you come here?

37
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,160
And who hurt you?

38
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,280
After separating from you people,

39
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,720
I traveled around with Xingchen.

40
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,600
A few months ago,

41
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
I rushed back to Snow White Pavilion

42
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,880
to celebrate my master's birthday.

43
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
Unexpectedly,

44
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
when I got back to Snow White Pavilion...

45
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Master! Master!

46
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,920
Master!

47
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,880
Master!

48
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
Master!

49
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,160
Master!

50
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,240
Master!

51
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
Be careful...

52
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
Who was it?

53
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Xue Yang!

54
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,640
Song Lan, you tell Xiao Xingchen

55
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,160
that this is a big gift for him.

56
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
He slaughtered the Snow White Pavilion

57
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,680
and tortured my master for more than ten days!

58
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,320
He was hidden on the roof,

59
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,840
and waited to attack me

60
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,320
when I felt uneasy.

61
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,600
Xue Yang...

62
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,800
took revenge on Xiao Xingchen by...

63
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,840
And then?

64
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Then I became drowsy...

65
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,520
By the way,

66
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,040
in a trance, I seemed to see Xingchen.

67
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,800
He told me

68
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,680
that he's taking me to see his Master,

69
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,000
Baoshan Wanderer.

70
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,080
She can heal my eyes.

71
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,640
Baoshan Wanderer!

72
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,920
The legendary seclusive cultivator who was said

73
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,520
to be able to revive the dead, give flesh to bones!

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
Exactly.

75
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,790
He took me to Yiling.

76
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,150
After that,

77
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,910
I don't know anything.

78
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Then I met Childe Wei.

79
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,320
What about Baoshan Wanderer?

80
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Is she here?

81
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,520
Let Bro Song rest first.

82
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,840
But...

83
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Baoshan Wanderer is my Grandmaster.

84
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,480
How could I not know where she is?

85
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
You mean she can...

86
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,120
Yeah.

87
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Senior sister, Jiang Cheng can be saved.

88
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,280
You're awake.

89
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,680
Come here. It's time for dinner.

90
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,920
Jiang Cheng.

91
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,520
Do you really want to die?

92
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,520
I can't seek revenge when I'm alive.

93
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Why should I be alive then?

94
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,760
Maybe I'll be able to turn into a ferocious ghost.

95
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,575
You had undergone soul-calming ceremony

96
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:23,325
when you were little.

97
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,325
You won't be able to turn into a ferocious ghost

98
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,450
after you die.

99
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,200
If I can't seek revenge no matter I'm dead or alive,

100
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,840
then what's the difference between the two?

101
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
But

102
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,800
if you don't replenish your strength,

103
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,440
how can we go take back your golden core?

104
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
That's right.

105
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,200
Don't doubt it.

106
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,560
You didn't hear me wrong.

107
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,800
What I said is

108
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
"take back your golden core".

109
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
You know how?

110
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,920
I do.

111
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,880
You should have known

112
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
that my mother, ZangSe Wanderer,

113
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
is the pupil of Baoshan Wanderer, haven't you?

114
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,680
Baoshan Wanderer,

115
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,920
a legendary cultivator who had lived for hundreds of years,

116
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,575
a seclusive master who was said

117
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,500
to be able to revive the dead, give flesh to bones!

118
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,640
You mean...

119
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
You mean...

120
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,320
I mean

121
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,880
that I know how to save you,

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,960
and that I know in the name "Baoshan"
(means embracing mountains)

123
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
which mountain is being embraced.

124
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,160
In another word,

125
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,040
I can take you

126
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
to see Baoshan Wanderer.

127
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,520
But,

128
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,760
but isn't it that you can't remember

129
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
the things when you were little?

130
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,160
It isn't that

131
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,560
I can't remember anything at all.

132
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,950
There are a few memory pieces

133
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,150
which repeated many times

134
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
I still remember them.

135
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,240
I always remember

136
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
the voice of a woman

137
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,480
repeating something to me,

138
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
telling me a thing and a place.

139
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
The voice said that

140
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
if I find myself in an absolutely desperate situation,

141
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
I can go up the mountain

142
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
and ask the immortals

143
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,080
on the mountain for help.

144
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,560
You mean...

145
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,240
Sit first.

146
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,520
- I... - No talk now.

147
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Eat first.

148
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,880
But...

149
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,880
We can talk while eating.

150
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,080
Or else I won't say anything.

151
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
This is for you.

152
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,200
Fill yourself first.

153
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,640
I'll take you there in a few days.

154
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,800
Today!

155
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Tomorrow.

156
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
We have to help senior sister to settle down.

157
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
It's not suitable for her to go with us.

158
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,840
What are you scared of?

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Those immortals aged hundreds years

160
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,720
won't disappear in a sudden.

161
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Besides there are many taboos of meeting them.

162
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,080
I'll have to tell you one by one.

163
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,600
Or else, if you should do

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
something forbidden,

165
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
and anger the Grandmaster,

166
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,520
both of us would be over.

167
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,720
When you go up the mountain,

168
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,360
you can't open your eyes and look around.

169
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,840
You can't memorize the scenery,

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,400
nor look at their faces.

171
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,080
And remember,

172
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,800
no matter what they tell you to do,

173
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,720
you have to do it.

174
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,520
Okay!

175
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,200
And, here's the most important point.

176
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,440
If you're asked who you are,

177
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
you have to say

178
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
that you're the son of Zangse Wanderer.

179
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,880
You can't reveal your true identity!

180
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,040
Okay!

181
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,120
Except for those,

182
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,800
you can tell the truth about other things,

183
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,200
including your injuries,

184
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
and the one who hurt you.

185
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,520
Okay!

186
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,000
This,

187
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,480
except you and me,

188
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
can never be known by a third person.

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,720
Not even senior sister!

190
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,200
Otherwise she'll go with us.

191
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,960
Okay!

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,680
Is it that no matter what I say now

193
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,080
you'll replay "Okay"?

194
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,720
Eat.

195
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,280
Come on!

196
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
Okay!

197
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, how about my sister?

198
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,560
Senior sister is all right now.

199
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,280
Perhaps now she is in back hill,

200
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,920
picking herbs with Wen Ning.

201
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,800
If she doesn't do something,

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,120
she'll feel uneasy.

203
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,400
Tastes terrible!

204
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,400
In terms of bothering others,

205
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,440
she's really as good as Jiang Cheng.

206
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
Actually, I'm here just to tell you

207
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,200
that bro Song's eyes recovered very quickly.

208
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,040
He will soon be able to see things.

209
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,200
Then he can leave soon.

210
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,560
We have violated the rules,

211
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,720
taking in so many people Wen clan wants to catch.

212
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
Doesn't matter with one more.

213
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,840
Yeah, you're right.

214
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,400
By the way,

215
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,880
I have asked bro Song to take my senior sister

216
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,360
away to meet up with Lan Zhan and the Jins.

217
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,800
Wen Qing.

218
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,040
Could you give me some tranquilizing powder?

219
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,240
I want the kind that can

220
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,240
let people sleep for a whole day.

221
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,840
Thanks.

222
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,640
Have you thought about what if Jiang Cheng

223
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,800
knows the truth?

224
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,080
There's no "what if".

225
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,400
He'll never know it.

226
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There's no "what if"?

227
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
You can hide the truth form him for a while.

228
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,440
But can you hide it for the rest of his life?

229
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,160
Wen Qing.

230
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,760
If today it had been Wen Ning who was wounded like that,

231
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,440
I'm sure you would be the same as me.

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,400
You'd make the same choice.

233
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
Senior sister.

234
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
Xian.

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,760
Senior sister.

236
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
Senior sister, I bring...

237
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
Cheng just fell asleep. Don't disturb him.

238
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
He has enough sleep.

239
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,120
Xian.

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,040
I keep it low, okay?

241
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,960
Let's talk over there.

242
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,200
Let's go.

243
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,880
Senior sister.

244
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't think you've slept well these days.

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,320
I specifically asked Wen Qing for some incense powder

246
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
which can clam minds and help sleep.

247
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
You can put it in the incense burner.

248
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,400
Xian.

249
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,480
I haven't seen you all afternoon.

250
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,800
Where have you been?

251
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Have you had your dinner?

252
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,480
Wait a minute.

253
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,760
Senior sister!

254
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,520
This smell is...

255
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,720
surely Lotus Root and Rib soup!

256
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,800
I have left some especially for you.

257
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,880
But compared with the soup made in Yunmeng,

258
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,320
it tastes a little different.

259
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,360
Have a try.

260
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
It smells great!

261
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,720
Senior sister.

262
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,680
Do you remember

263
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,850
the first time

264
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,600
when you made Lotus Root and Rib soup for me?

265
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,120
I do.

266
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
At that time

267
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,040
dad had just led you into our family.

268
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Yeah.

269
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
At that time

270
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
it was the first time I came to Lotus Cove.

271
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
So I was terrified to death,

272
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,920
especially afraid of those Jiang Cheng's puppies.

273
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,040
Senior sister.

274
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
It seems that Jiang Cheng is of great pride

275
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,840
since he was a child.

276
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,600
It ticks me off!

277
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,680
Why?!

278
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,560
Why?!

279
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,080
Why?!

280
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,160
Why did they send all my puppies away?

281
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
Why?!

282
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,240
It ticks me off!

283
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,720
Why?!

284
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Why?!

285
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm angry!

286
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,200
Xian.

287
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,440
You don't have to be afraid.

288
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,840
Cheng is a good boy.

289
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,960
He'll be all right in a few days.

290
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,880
Sorry, uncle Jiang.

291
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,040
I've put you in trouble.

292
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,200
Xian.

293
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,920
In Lotus Cove,

294
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
you don't have to apologize for what you didn't do wrong.

295
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,560
Keep that in mind, okay?

296
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,720
Junior brother! Junior brother!

297
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,640
Let me in!

298
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,960
I need to sleep.

299
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Who is your Junior Brother?!

300
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,080
You give my puppies back!

301
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,880
My Feifei, my Moli, and my Xiaoai!

302
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
How could they?

303
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,120
Just because you're afraid of them?

304
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,360
They are my dogs! It's my house!

305
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,400
It's all mine!

306
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Why can you live here?!

307
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,400
Go away! If I see you again,

308
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,160
I'll let a group of dogs bite you!

309
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,760
I'll go. I'll go.

310
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,880
Don't send the dogs!

311
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,040
Go away!

312
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
Xian!

313
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
Wei Wuxian!

314
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,240
Xian!

315
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
Wei Wuxian!

316
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,080
Why are you on the tree?

317
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Xian, I saw you.

318
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,240
Your shoes have fallen under the tree.

319
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,600
My shoes!

320
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,680
Come down, let's go home.

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,880
No, I won't.

322
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,000
There are dogs.

323
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,480
There is no dog.

324
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
It was Cheng who deceived you.

325
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,240
How long have you been on the tree?

326
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,960
Your hands will get very tired if you go on like this.

327
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,120
Come on.

328
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,480
You just go.

329
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
I won't fall down.

330
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,720
Xian.

331
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,800
Xian.

332
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, it hurts a lot.

333
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,040
My leg is broken!

334
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280
It isn't broken.

335
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
It was just scratched.

336
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,280
- Ouch! - Stay still.

337
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,040
Let me carry you home.

338
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Have the dogs come yet?

339
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,240
Dogs? No.

340
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,840
If they come, I'll drive them away for you.

341
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,520
Oh! It hurts a lot.

342
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,400
Come on.

343
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,360
Your shoes.

344
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,560
Do they not fit you?

345
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,360
No.

346
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,720
They fit me well.

347
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
They're just a little bigger.

348
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,160
This is the first gift Uncle Jiang sent to me.

349
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,080
It's all right. I'll go back and change it for you.

350
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,880
You don't have to.

351
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,520
Xian.

352
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,480
No matter what Cheng said to you just now,

353
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,840
just ignore him.

354
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,840
He is bad-tempered.

355
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,440
And often plays alone at home.

356
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,560
Those little puppies are apples of his eye.

357
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,800
Now they were sent away by my daddy,

358
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,560
so he was very sad.

359
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,560
However, he was happy

360
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,600
with a friend accompanying him.

361
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,960
He just couldn't say it out.

362
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,160
You didn't go back for a long time.

363
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,120
He's so worried about you

364
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,600
that he woke me up anxiously.

365
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,080
So I just came out to find you.

366
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,680
Have you got it?

367
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Who is it?

368
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,240
Sister.

369
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,600
Cheng.

370
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,800
Come here.

371
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,600
Cheng.

372
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,960
It's OK now.

373
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,880
Didn't I ask you to bring some people to find Xian?

374
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's OK.

375
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,000
You have something to say to Xian, don't you?

376
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,560
I'm sorry.

377
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,560
It, it doesn't matter.

378
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Cheng.

379
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,000
Would you take Xian's quilt back first?

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,160
I've already taken it back.

381
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,040
Alright, come on.

382
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
Easy.

383
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,360
You two.

384
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,880
What should I do with you guys?

385
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,200
# Virid pool, old figures, as we were young. #

386
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:32,080
# Time elapsed and dreams seem illusory. #

387
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,320
# Hope to write a letter, console old friends missing me in Yunmeng. #

388
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:50,120
# With mind unsettling, I ask the sky. #

389
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,400
# Looking back, many years have passed without notice. #

390
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,560
# Hope there's no departure, no sorrow. #

391
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,840
# But no one would call me "Xian" anymore. #

392
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Don't worry.

393
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,480
I won't report you to uncle Jiang.

394
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,720
It was me who wanted to climb trees at night.

395
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,960
And then my leg got scratched.

396
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,720
Ok, you can also don't worry about

397
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
dogs in the future.

398
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,720
I'll help you chase them away.

399
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,760
Sister.

400
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,520
That's right.

401
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,440
This is the soup I cooked tonight.

402
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,360
There are still some left.

403
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
Drink it while it's warm.

404
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,480
Lotus Root and Rib soup made by my sister

405
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,440
is the most delicious.

406
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,480
Come and drink.

407
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,160
Come on. Have a drink.

408
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,360
This is yours.

409
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
Drink it.

410
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
I can still remember

411
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,680
that Lotus Root and Rib soup even now.

412
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Xian.

413
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,240
You, me, and Cheng

414
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,560
three of us,

415
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,800
three of us must be together forever.

416
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,960
And never,

417
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
never be parted.

418
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,640
Senior sister.

419
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,520
Senior sister.

420
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,000
Senior sister.

421
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,280
The efficacy of this powder

422
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,280
is enough for bro Song to take her away from Yiling.

423
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,640
Sis.

424
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,680
Wait till I get my golden core back.

425
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,080
I'll pick you up at Lanling right away.

426
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,800
Bro Song.

427
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,360
Even after my sister wakes up,

428
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
she must be sent to Lanling no matter how she reacts.

429
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,320
You can not let her back.

430
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,920
I understand.

431
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,880
When senior sister wakes up,

432
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,760
she will definitely blame me for acting on my own.

433
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm afraid this time

434
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,560
she won't cool down so easily.

435
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
When did she really get angry with you?

436
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,800
Yeah, you're right.

437
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,600
Childe Wei, Childe Jiang.

438
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,040
You don't have to do this.

439
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,960
Bro Song.

440
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,520
My sister's safety

441
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,280
is entrusted to you.

442
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,440
I swear to you on my life.

443
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,440
You can be sure

444
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,800
that as long as I am alive

445
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,560
I'll guarantee Lady Jiang arrive safely at Jin clan of Lanling.

446
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,360
Oh, by the way, Childe Wei,

447
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,400
could you convey a few words for me

448
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,480
If you see Xingchen,

449
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,720
just say...

450
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,960
Never mind.

451
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Childe Wei, Childe Jiang.

452
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,960
I shall say goodbye now.

453
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,920
Miss Wen, Childe Wen.

454
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,600
Farewell.

455
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,640
Let's go.

456
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,920
We're leaving, too.

457
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,720
Miss Wen.

458
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,120
Thank you for your hospitalization and care.

459
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,760
Farewell.

460
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,200
Wen Qing.

461
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,560
Don't blame him.

462
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,080
After all, what happened in Lotus Cove...

463
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,280
You don't have to explain it for him.

464
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,520
If I were him,

465
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,920
I would have behaved worse.

466
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,160
Did you really think it over?

467
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
I never hesitated at it.

468
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,040
Sister.

469
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,190
None of them cherishes his own life.

470
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,400
Down with the Wen clan! Revenge for Jiang clan!

471
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,440
Down with the Wen clan! Revenge for Jiang clan!

472
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,480
Down with the Wen clan! Revenge for Jiang clan!

473
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,080
The massacre of Jiang clan of Yunmeng

474
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,720
eventually became the last straw

475
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,000
to the rebellion against Wen clan among the gentry families.

476
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,720
The allied uprising of three main clans

477
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,560
Kill’em!!!

478
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,240
is historically named as the Sunshot Campaign.

479
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,650
= The Supervisory Office of Qinghe =

480
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,480
Here it is.

481
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,160
Is here really where

482
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,400
Baoshan Wanderer lives?

483
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,640
It's definitely here.

484
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,400
Why should I lie to you?

485
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,280
For letting you be happy for a few days

486
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,960
and then giving you a bigger disappointment?

487
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,360
Alright. From here,

488
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,080
I won't be able to go any further with you.

489
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,040
Okay.

490
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,960
I'll be waiting for you in the town back there.

491
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,960
Got it.

492
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,640
Jiang Cheng,

493
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,760
this is your only chance.

494
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,400
Don't be so impulsive next time!

495
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,320
Jiang Cheng, keep it in mind,

496
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,080
you must never, never open your eyes.

497
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,880
There aren't any beasts on the mountain.

498
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,320
I'd rather you walk slowly.

499
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,800
Even if you fall, you can't pull the cloth down.

500
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,080
You must not be curious.

501
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,800
Remember, just say that you're Wei WuXian.

502
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,840
You know how to answer the questions, don’t you?

503
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,440
Childe, please stop.

504
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,880
E... Excuse me.

505
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,560
Is here where Baoshan Wanderer lives?

506
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,280
Who are you and why you're here?

507
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm the son of Zangse Wanderer,

508
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,600
who was the disciple of Baoshan Wanderer.

509
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,480
I, Wei Ying,

510
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,240
came all the way here to see Baoshan Immortal.

511
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,680
Zangse Wanderer?

512
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,200
She's already out of the mountain

513
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,520
and has nothing to do with Baoshan Immortal.

514
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Childe, please go back.

515
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,640
Wei Ying came here just to see Baoshan Immortal!

516
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,960
Hope Grandmaster can save my life

517
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,440
for my mother's sake.

518
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,440
Save your life?

519
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,440
Why did Childe say that?

520
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,240
After the death of my father and mother,

521
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,560
Wei Ying was adopted by Jiang Fengmian,

522
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,880
the clan leader of Jiang clan of Yunmeng,

523
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,680
and became a disciple of Yunmeng.

524
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,080
Recently,

525
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,400
Wen clan of Qishan caused much trouble.

526
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,040
And many clans have been destroyed,

527
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,880
including Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

528
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,760
Lotus Cove fell into chaos.

529
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,360
Clan Leader Jiang and madam Yu were murdered.

530
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,800
And I...

531
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,960
also became a total wreck,

532
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,720
because my golden core was melted by Cores Crusher, Wen Zhuliu

533
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,280
in the melee.

534
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,440
You said that you are the son of Zangse Wanderer?

535
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,680
Then who is your father?

536
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,600
Wei Changze, Clan Leader Jiang's retainer.

537
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,640
What did your parents

538
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,840
die of?

539
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,480
A... A night hunting more than ten years ago.

540
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,200
Where the Grandmaster lives

541
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,640
is also told by Zangse Wanderer?

542
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,480
Yes, it is.

543
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,480
OK, that's enough.

544
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
Everything is destiny.

545
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,200
You can get up.

546
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,400
Understood.

547
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,640
Hold on to the ribbon and follow me.

548
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,880
Thank you, Immortal!

549
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,120
Thank you, Immortal!

550
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,720
Stop talking, Childe.

551
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,000
And never open your eyes.

552
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,080
Got it.
