For the first one to be released Princes in the暮

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,780
There are five different f chaotic detentions.

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
And few don't lives with Bahputer.

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,300
Is there really some secret between dingseathers

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,800
or memorize of Eun التيai?

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,880
Hey,

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Ji Xiu, I didn't mean it.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,880
You are right.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
You don't ask me anything.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
You don't even have any preparation.

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Ji Xiu, let me tell you a secret.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I just heard that there is something in the back mountain.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,880
I suspect that someone sneaked into the back mountain.

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you think that everything is related to the shooting?

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
What are you doing?

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
What is the meaning of this?

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
It hurts.

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Ji Xiu, I don't know.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
I don't know.

48
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880

I don't know.

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
I don't know.

63
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
I don't know.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I don't know.

65
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
I don't know.

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
I don't know.

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
You are so good.

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
You are so good.

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
You are a good person.

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Brother Wang Ji.

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Brother Lan Wang Ji.

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Brother Lan Zhan.

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Don't look at me like that.

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I called you Wang Ji.

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
You didn't agree to it.

83
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
I can't even call your name.

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,880
If you're not happy, you can call back.

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Put your legs down.

86
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Okay, put them down.

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
By the way, Brother Wang Ji, I want to ask you a question.

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Why do you hate me so much?

89
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Mr. Wang, don't say two words, you're not polite.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm sorry to apologize to you, I was wrong to admit it.

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,880
I shouldn't have forced you that night.

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I shouldn't have drunk or fought with you.

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,880
But I swear, I've never seen your family's house.

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Otherwise, I wouldn't have drunk that angel's smile in front of you.

95
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
I'll take the house back to steal it.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
And let's talk about the reason.

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Who is the first one to do it?

98
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
It's you.

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,880
If you don't do it first, we can have a good talk.

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm the one.

101
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,880
If someone else does it first, I'll be embarrassed.

102
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,880
So this matter can't be all my fault, right?

103
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Mr. Wang, are you listening?

104
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Mr. Wang, look at me.

105
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Say it again.

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,880
No, I'm sorry.

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
You've never regretted it.

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
I have.

109
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,880
You can say whatever you want.

111
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Sister.

112
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Sister, where are you going again?

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Sister, since you came to Gusu, you've been missing people.

114
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Are you really looking for something?

115
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm not looking for anything.

116
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
I'm looking for something.

117
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Are you really looking for something?

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Remember, the silver iron pendant is the same as the one in Da Fan Mountain.

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
You probably won't forget it.

120
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Find it out and bring it back.

121
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Sister, I'm not asking.

122
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Don't be too tired.

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Sister, since you came to the Cloud Recesses,

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,880
have you felt anything?

125
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
No.

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Sister, I have all the medicine you gave me.

127
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
We're in the same generation.

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
I can't take it anymore.

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
I can't take it anymore.

130
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
I can't cure my brother's illness.

131
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
If it weren't for that year...

132
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Sister.

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Stop talking.

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,880
A'Ning, one day in the morning, I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

138
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

139
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

140
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

141
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

142
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

144
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

145
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Have you finished your book?

146
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Yes.

147
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
By the way, I won't be coming tomorrow.

148
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,880
This is for you.

149
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
By the way, I forgot to add something.

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
It's done.

151
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
I'll take you away from Buye Tian.

152
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
You must be bored.

153
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
I knew you'd be bored.

154
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Can you change your word or add two words?

155
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm bored.

156
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,880
You really added two words. Thank you.

157
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Buye.

158
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
I'm here.

159
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Lan Zhan.

160
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Be careful.

161
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
I brought you a sword today.

162
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Do you still want your book?

163
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
I don't know how to fix it.

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
You have to fix it.

165
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Don't tell me you haven't read it.

166
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
I don't believe it.

167
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Go out.

168
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
We've fought.

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
No.

170
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
You don't know how to use it.

171
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
You don't know.

172
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Lan Zhan.

173
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
No.

174
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Lan Zhan.

175
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Lan Zhan.

176
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
You're a real bad guy.

177
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
You're really...

178
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Get out.

179
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
You're a good guy.

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
You're a gentleman.

181
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
You're a good man.

182
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
You know how to use it.

183
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
I don't think so.

184
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm not sure about the rest.

185
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
How dare you call me a bad guy?

186
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Just leave.

187
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
I'll be the last one.

188
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
No need to see me off.

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
He called you a bad guy.

190
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Wenxiu.

191
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
You're so arrogant.

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I heard Lan Wangji call you a bad guy for the first time.

193
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
What did you do?

194
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
It's a pity.

195
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
I broke this sword for him today.

196
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
I want everyone to know

197
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm the first person.

198
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
What's your good deed?

199
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
What's your good deed?

200
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Is it a waste of time?

201
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
You've lost our face.

202
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm sorry for him.

203
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
He didn't accept it.

204
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
He's been so strict with me.

205
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm so mad at him.

206
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
It's just a pity.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I'm not good enough to see

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
my brother's true beauty.

209
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm not that good.

210
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
He's not happy to see her.

211
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
He's just a fool.

212
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
It's a pity.

213
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
I'm not good enough.

214
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
By the way,

215
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
didn't you tell me

216
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm the kind of person who sells my brother?

217
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I've offended Lan Wangji and Lan Qiren.

218
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I'll be dead tomorrow.

219
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
No one will tell you.

220
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Jiang Cheng,

221
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
don't worry about it.

222
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Let's talk about it later.

223
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Besides,

224
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
you've told me so many times.

225
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
You don't care about it anymore, right?

226
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
There will be more of this in the future.

227
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Don't let me know.

228
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Don't let me see it.

229
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Go, go, go.

230
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Shh.

231
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Isn't this the bird that's been bred in Qishan Forest?

232
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Why is it here?

233
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Qishan Forest?

234
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
How do you know it's their bird?

235
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
We, Qinghe,

236
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,880
often see these birds flying around Qishan.

237
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
It's said

238
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Qishan Forest used to be used for monitoring.

239
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Why did the bird fly to the unknown place?

240
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I don't know either.

241
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Are they in the Wenshan,

242
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
the Guantian and the Guantian?

243
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Brother,

244
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
there has been a movement in the back mountain.

245
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
It's not destroyed,

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
but there is a interference.

247
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
But who came out of the back mountain?

248
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Wei Ying.

249
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Brother,

250
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
do you have a knot?

251
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,880
This knot is what the fairy said.

252
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
If it doesn't go,

253
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
the knot won't be destroyed.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
It?

255
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I won't mention it for now.

256
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
Wang Jian.

257
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Chief.

258
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Greetings, Chief.

259
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Second Master.

260
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Mian Li.

261
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
What's the matter?

262
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
I just got a report from Xiangming.

263
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,880
It's said that the water in the Wenshan is in chaos.

264
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
The river is in a mess.

265
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Xiangming is in danger.

266
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Xiangming is in a bad mood.

267
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
I hope that the Blue Division can get out of this.

268
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Water in the Wenshan?

269
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
The people of the Wenshan

270
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
are all in a good mood.

271
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
They are not as bad as the water in the Wenshan.

272
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
How could they get water in the Wenshan?

273
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
I don't know.

274
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Chief,

275
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
do you need me to get water out of the Wenshan?

276
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
You can go back to Xiangming for me.

277
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,880
I will go down the mountain to get water out of the Wenshan tomorrow morning.

278
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Chief, you are tired today.

279
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,880
You are like a little frog in the water.

280
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
I am willing to take care of you.

281
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
It's not that simple.

282
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Get ready.

283
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Yes.

284
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Wang Ji.

285
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Come with me to the mountain tomorrow.

286
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Yes.

287
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Senior sister.

288
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Senior sister.

289
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Miss Wen.

290
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Miss Wen.

291
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Young master Jiang.

292
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Miss Wen.

293
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Why are you here?

294
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Miss Wen.

295
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Why do you have to be so polite to me?

296
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Ah Xin, you are here.

297
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Yes, I am here.

298
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Senior sister, what's wrong?

299
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
The rain has been pouring several days.

300
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I felt dizzy when I went to the western side this morning.

301
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Fortunately, I met Miss Wen.

302
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
She didn't only send me back,

303
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
but also used a few pills for me.

304
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
It's much better now.

305
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Sister, you are sick.

306
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Why don't you tell us?

307
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
The little old man who was in the middle of the war

308
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
has been sick for three days.

309
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Senior sister must have been thinking about me.

310
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Miss Wen.

311
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Thank you for this time.

312
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
You are welcome.

313
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I am a doctor.

314
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
I am a doctor.

315
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
It's my duty to cure people.

316
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Senior sister.

317
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
I heard that Mr. Lan went to Qinghe to attend the Qingtan meeting.

318
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
We don't need to listen to the snow these days.

319
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I also heard that Zeng Wu Jun is going to leave the mountain to get water.

320
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,880
If we leave now, we should be able to get up.

321
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Water?

322
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Yes.

323
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I heard that the water level of the Caiyi Town is very unusual.

324
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Zeng Wu Jun.

325
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Zeng Wu Jun.

326
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Zeng Wu Jun.

327
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Mr. Wei.

328
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Mr. Jiang.

329
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
You...

330
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Zeng Wu Jun.

331
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
I heard that there is a water disaster in Biling Lake.

332
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
And we don't need to listen to the snow these days.

333
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
So we want to practice with Zeng Wu Jun.

334
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Yes. Let's go together.

335
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
No rules.

336
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
No rules?

337
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
We have the same dream.

338
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Jiang Cheng and I are used to playing in the lake.

339
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Water is not for us.

340
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
But we want to guess.

341
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Besides, we don't need to listen to the snow these days.

342
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Yes, Zeng Wu Jun.

343
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
There is a lot of water in the dream.

344
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
We can help.

345
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
No need.

346
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,880
So you two,

347
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
let's go down the mountain together.

348
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Mr. Lan.

349
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I want to see you.

350
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Zeng Wu Jun.

351
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Ms. Wen is a doctor.

352
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Although the water level is small,

353
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
if there is an accident near the village,

354
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
she can still help the doctor.

355
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Then let's go down the mountain together.

356
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Sister.

357
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Wait for me.

358
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Wen Ning.

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Why are you here?

360
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I told you.

361
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Sister.

362
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,880
I heard you are going to the kitchen.

363
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I want to go with you.

364
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Let's go.

365
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Ning.

366
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
This trip may be dangerous.

367
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Why don't you listen to me?

368
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Ms. Wen.

369
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
The land is so beautiful.

370
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
The sword is so strong.

371
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
There should be no problem this time.

372
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Besides,

373
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
I will protect her.

374
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
There shouldn't be any accident.

375
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
It's not a big deal.

376
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
There is no problem.

377
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Mr. Lan.

378
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
My brother is not a good son.

379
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
He only went to the mountain to drink water.

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
He thinks it's fun to travel.

381
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
That's why he came here.

382
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
But don't worry, Mr. Lan.

383
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Ning and I will not go to travel.

384
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Please allow me to go with you.

385
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Ms. Wen is serious.

386
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Let's go together.

387
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Why did you bring them here?

388
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
It's not a small matter.

389
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Don't joke.

390
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
I just saw your figure.

391
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I think I want to let the two gentlemen go together.

392
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
That's why I agreed.

393
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Isn't it?

394
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Please come in.

395
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I think there is no one cleaning your place.

396
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Sir, please be more patient.

397
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
To be honest,

398
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
since the lake started to eat people,

399
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
I have never been to the hotel.

400
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
You two are the first.

401
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,880
So I will do it myself.

402
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Eat people?

403
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Isn't the water broken?

404
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
It's just the grass in the water.

405
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
How can it eat people?

406
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,880
I don't know what's in the lake.

407
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,880
The Biling Lake is a calm place.

408
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
But two months ago,

409
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
there were a group of foreigners.

410
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
They were infected.

411
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,880
It didn't work out at first.

412
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
But later,

413
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
more and more people came.

414
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Many local people were infected.

415
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
It didn't work out these years.

416
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
What about the people on the boat?

417
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
They ate people.

418
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
They were eaten by the people.

419
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,880
But what about the food?

420
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Nothing.

421
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
So how did you do the things in the lake?

422
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Of course, they were eaten.

423
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
After so many people fell,

424
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
they didn't come up.

425
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
They didn't even have a body.

426
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Brother Wang,

427
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
do you think the things in the lake

428
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
are water broken?

429
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
It's not a quality dream.

430
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
But I don't think so.

431
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Look,

432
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,880
if the things in the lake are not water broken,

433
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
what is it?

434
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
How about this?

435
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
We two come to bet.

436
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
We can decide whether it's the same.

437
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
It's boring.

438
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Lan Zhan.

439
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Lan Zhan.

440
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
It's really boring.

441
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Too bad!

442
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Qin Liu is on the chase.

443
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
He can't open the door!

444
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Our traditional poem is

445
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
hma waran shuntu,

446
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,880
,

447
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,880
,

448
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Forget me!

449
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
If one of you wants to talk in such a voice.

450
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,780
Will I lose more Mom over

451
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
?

452
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
But these waterfalls can only be trusted by the people.

453
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Now they dare to eat people.

454
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Lord Zewu, no matter what happened to Xiangming yesterday,

455
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
did anyone see what was going on in the lake?

456
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Those gold monsters are very cunning.

457
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Once they are swallowed by water,

458
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
they will be able to survive.

459
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
No one has ever seen their original life.

460
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Then Lord Zewu,

461
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,880
is there any progress in the shooting ceremony?

462
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Lord Wei, why do you ask this?

463
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,880
The Clouds are not moving from ancient times.

464
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,880
But now, they are being swallowed by the shooting ceremony.

465
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
And there are waterfalls.

466
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Do you think they have any connection?

467
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,880
The shooting ceremony is still underway.

468
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,880
But the shooting ceremony is a mystery.

469
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
I don't think there is any connection.

470
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
But...

471
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Lord Wei, the shooting ceremony is still underway.

472
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Lord Zewu is right.

473
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Let's not stay here any longer.

474
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Lan Zhan, are you with me?

475
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, let me ask you.

476
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Is there any progress in the shooting ceremony?

477
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Not yet.

478
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,880
But how do I feel that your brother is hiding something from us?

479
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,880
You also feel that your brother is hiding something from us?

480
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,880
And I think that this matter is not a small matter.

481
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
How could it be possible?

482
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
The night is falling.

483
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Lan Zhan, how could I not know this rule?

484
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
I haven't had a drink yet. Give me a drink.

485
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
The night is falling.

486
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
The night is falling.

487
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
Be careful.

488
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,880
The place is a mess.

489
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Lord Zewu, these waterfalls are very clever.

490
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,880
If they keep hiding under the boat,

491
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
will we keep looking for them?

492
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
What if we can't find them?

493
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,880
We'll just have to find them.

494
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Lan Zhan, look at me!

495
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Wuliu.

496
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
What is this?

497
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I've never seen this kind of waterfalls.

498
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Could it be that they've been drawn by something?

499
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Lord Wei, how do you know that they're under the boat?

500
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,880
It's simple. It's not right to drink water.

501
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Why not?

502
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,880
The boat that he was on just now only had one person's weight.

503
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,880
But there's still more than two people's weight to drink water.

504
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,880
So, there must be waterfalls under the boat.

505
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
You're indeed experienced.

506
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Lan Zhan, I didn't mean to break your water just now.

507
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,880
But those waterfalls are too clever.

508
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
If I tell them, they'll all run away.

509
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Hey, Mr. Nan'er.

510
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I didn't say anything just now that you stole my wine.

511
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Let's just treat it as a gift to me, okay?

512
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Stay away from me.

513
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
It's coming!

514
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Catch it!

515
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
You still have the right to break it?

516
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
What's the secret of this sword?

517
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Anything.

518
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Anything?

519
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Anything.

520
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
This sword has a spirit.

521
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
It's called the Immortal Guard.

522
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
I didn't ask you to call it anything.

523
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,880
But its name is just any name.

524
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Look at it yourself.

525
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
You don't need to say it. I know.

526
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
You must be wondering why it's called this name.

527
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Is there any special meaning to it?

528
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Actually, there is no special meaning.

529
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
When Uncle Jiang gave me this sword, he asked me what I wanted to call it.

530
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
I thought more than twenty.

531
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
But I didn't have one.

532
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
I just gave it to him.

533
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Now I think that I'm not tired of it.

534
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Nonsense.

535
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
I think it's okay.

536
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
The fog is getting bigger.

537
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Be careful.

538
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
Jiang Cheng, how are you?

539
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Jiang Cheng, where are you?

540
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
I'm fine.

541
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Mr. Jiang.

542
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Miss Wen.

543
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
You're hurt.

544
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Miss Wen, I'm fine.

545
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Miss Wen.

546
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Jiang Cheng, how are you?

547
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm fine.

548
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Fortunately, I'm just skin-raising.

549
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I'll be fine in a few days.

550
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I'll be fine.

551
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
The color of the lake.

552
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
The color of the lake.

553
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Go back now.

554
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,880
The water is the reason why the boat is being covered in the lake.

555
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Hurry up.

556
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
What's going on?

557
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Look, they're going together.

558
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Water source?

559
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
It's the water source!

560
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
They're going together after the water is broken.

561
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
They sent the water source.

562
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
They're going to eat us all.

563
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Mr. Wen, what should we do?

564
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Yu Jin.

565
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
Yu Jin.

566
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Yu Jin.

567
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Yu Jin.

568
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Yu Jin.

569
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Yu Jin.

570
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Lan Zhan.

571
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Lan Zhan, thank you for your time.

572
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,880
But why did you save my brother?

573
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Can't you hold me?

574
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
You're so uncomfortable.

575
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
How about this?

576
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
I'll give you my hand first.

577
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
You hold me.

578
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
I won't let others touch you.

579
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
We're so familiar.

580
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
What are you talking about?

581
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
How can you be like this?

582
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
How can you be like this?

583
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Can you say a few words when someone throws a bow at me?

584
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
Shut up!

585
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
You...

586
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
Anxin.

587
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Wei Wuxian.

588
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
What did you come for?

589
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
I came to visit you.

590
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Wei Wuxian.

591
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
What are you doing here?

592
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
I came to visit you.

593
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
It's okay.

594
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
But what's wrong with her?

595
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Why is she so confused?

596
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Mr Wei,

597
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
you need to rest.

598
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
If you're okay, please go back.

599
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
This is for you.

600
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
This is...

601
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
It's for Wen Ning's body.

602
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Body?

603
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Although I'm not as good as you,

604
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,880
if I were to talk about magic,

605
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I still have a hand.

606
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Wen Ning is a good person.

607
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,880
She won't be able to sleep until she's drunk.

608
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
She won't be able to sleep.

609
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Miss Wen, don't you think it's weird?

610
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Mr Wei, what do you want to say?

611
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Did Wen Ning have some unusual experiences before?

612
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,880
That's why she's so easily broken up.

613
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Miss Wen,

614
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
no matter what you do here,

615
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I hope you can let her take this talisman.

616
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,880
I also hope that this talisman can help her.

617
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Of course, you can choose not to believe me.

618
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,880
If you think this talisman is useless,

619
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
throw it away.

620
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Uncle Wei!

621
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Uncle Wei!

622
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Uncle Wei!

623
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Uncle Wei!

624
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Mr Wei, why don't you give her the talisman?

625
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
No need.

626
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Don't go, Mr Wei.

627
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
The talisman represents the same thoughts.

628
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Uncle Wei!

629
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
The talisman is here!

630
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
The talisman is here!

631
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
The good talisman!

632
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
The talisman is here!

633
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Come and have a look!

634
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Wang Ji, what are you thinking about?

635
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Water Star Moon.

636
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,880
It's not true what Wei Wu said.

637
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
The talisman is a beautiful forest.

638
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Water Star Moon is a warm place.

639
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,880
The blood of the brotherhood is very clear.

640
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
Wang Ji,

641
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
I'm still not clear about this matter.

642
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
I just hope that

643
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,880
things are not as I thought.

644
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,880
But if it's true,

645
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,880
I'm afraid I can't control you.

646
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Lan Zhan!

647
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Eat the skin!

648
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
No need.

649
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Ha!

650
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
What's this?

651
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Jiang Cheng, keep going!

652
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,880
If you want the skin, I'll buy a bottle of it.

653
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
I don't want it.

654
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
The good talisman!

655
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
The talisman is here!
