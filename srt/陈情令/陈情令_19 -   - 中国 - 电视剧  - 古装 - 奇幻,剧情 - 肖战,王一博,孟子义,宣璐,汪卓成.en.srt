The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 19

3
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,170
= Seven days later =

4
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
Jiang Cheng...

5
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,440
What is taking you so long...

6
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
Sir, what would you like?

7
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
What now?

8
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,520
Why can't you get up?

9
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,360
Weren't you an arrogant brat

10
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
back in the Slaughter Xuanwu Cave?

11
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
Try that again.

12
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,920
Try that again!

13
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,320
Li, you two, come over here.

14
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
Slow down.

15
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
- Master... - Come, come, come.

16
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,280
Xian, come here.

17
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
Would you like a lotus nut?

18
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,080
- Look at yourself.  - Would you like?

19
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,440
Cheng, come over here.

20
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Hurry.

21
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
Mom...

22
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Cheng.

23
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Come, come, come.

24
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Let mom take a good look.

25
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
Cheng, have you been practicing lately?

26
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,760
Nice. Nice.

27
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,200
What are you holding?

28
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,080
Here.

29
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Look, isn't Cheng a good boy?

30
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,800
Give me a kiss.

31
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
Sweet boy.

32
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,200
Here.

33
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,520
Let papa test your arm strength.

34
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,520
Terrific.

35
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Cheng,

36
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
you are gonna be the clan leader of Lotus Cove.

37
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,280
No!!

38
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,120
Immortal!

39
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,920
Thank you so much, Immortal!

40
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,480
Thank you so much!

41
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,840
I, Jiang...

42
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,520
Wei Ying

43
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,640
really appreciate your help.

44
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
I can only kowtow to thank you for saving my life.

45
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,400
Just give it up.

46
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,960
Where is Jiang Cheng?

47
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
What?

48
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,680
Don't wanna talk?

49
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
You know you can't save him even if you stay silent.

50
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Right now, Jiang Cheng is merely a waste,

51
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,760
no better than a livestock.

52
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,920
Jiang clan of Yunmeng

53
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
is done for.

54
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
While the old owners are gone,

55
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
you as a dog

56
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,120
would better start wagging your tail to

57
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,920
beg your new master for mercy.

58
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
How about this.

59
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
You caught me in a good mood today.

60
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,400
All you need to do is to lie on your stomach

61
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,120
and crawl three rounds.

62
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,720
Then I'll let you go. Deal?

63
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
Wei-dog,

64
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
what do you mean by the look?

65
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,120
Childe Wen asked you to kneel down,

66
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
do you not understand?

67
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
Sorry about that.

68
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,720
I just heard a dog barking.

69
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,680
I didn't hear human voice,

70
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,440
did you?

71
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,760
Beat him!

72
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
Beat him to death!

73
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,160
Childe Wen,

74
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,160
you promised me before

75
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,640
that we'll chop off one of his arms.

76
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
He still owes us an arm.

77
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,000
No.

78
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
No, no, no.

79
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,800
Chopping off his arm would cause too much bleeding.

80
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
It wouldn't be fun if he dies too soon.

81
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,360
Stop.

82
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,880
I will ask Wen Zhuliu to crush his golden core first.

83
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,440
I want to hear him scream like little bastard Jiang Cheng did!

84
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,160
How wonderful.

85
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,480
Let's crush his core first.

86
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,480
Then chop off his arm.

87
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,480
How nice of you.

88
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,600
Whatever torture techniques you've got,

89
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
bring them on!

90
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
Mark your words.

91
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,080
You are going to die. Why still play a hero?

92
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,400
It is exactly because I am about to die,

93
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
that I am not afraid.

94
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,080
What I'm afraid is that I won't die.

95
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,760
If you have the guts, just torture me.

96
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,080
The crueler the better.

97
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,360
After I die, I'll turn into a ferocious ghost

98
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,080
and haunt the Wen Clan of Qishan day and night,

99
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
cursing you all!

100
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,560
Disciples of the gentry families have received soul-calming ceremony.

101
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
You cannot turn into a ferocious ghost.

102
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,400
Don't listen to his crap.

103
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,640
You cannot be more wrong,

104
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,840
Childe Wen.

105
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
I did not grow up in the Jiang clan since birth.

106
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,160
I am the son of a myrmidon.

107
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,120
I did not have the chance to go through the ceremony.

108
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,360
If I die with resent and become a ferocious ghost to haunt you,

109
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,200
you shall be careful.

110
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
You shut your mouth.

111
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,920
There is no such thing.

112
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,520
People should die and become a skeleton

113
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
buried underground.

114
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,760
Childe Wen,

115
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,640
We've been trying to catch him for so long.

116
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,400
Wasn't it all for punishing him?

117
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,520
Don't tell me you are gonna let him go

118
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
just because of his bullshit.

119
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
Of course not!

120
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,920
Putting on an act to fool me?

121
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
You should think it twice!

122
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Wen Zhuliu.

123
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Wait a second.

124
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Childe Wen,

125
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,280
it took us quite some effort to catch him.

126
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Wouldn't it be a shame

127
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,000
if he dies so easily?

128
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Our fun is just about to begin.

129
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,120
Childe Wei,

130
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,360
back in the Xuanwu Cave, you've really got yourself badly hurt

131
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,080
trying to be a hero rescuing the damsel in distress.

132
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,960
Wei Ying,

133
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,120
you really think you are not afraid of anything,

134
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
and you're brave and glorious, don't you?

135
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,240
I didn't expect

136
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,760
you can really speak human language.

137
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,080
Show off your speech again?

138
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,160
Great.

139
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
I'd like to see just how much longer

140
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
you can keep up your backbone.

141
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,480
Wen Zhuliu,

142
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,000
pick him up.

143
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
Why did these Wens of Qishan

144
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
come to our Yiling again?

145
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,400
Who knows...

146
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,720
I just know this bunch of cultivators

147
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,840
are going to bring civilians suffer again

148
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,320
I heard that even the Yunmeng  was destroyed.

149
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,600
An extreme chaos is looming.

150
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,280
Wei Ying,

151
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,600
do you know where we are?

152
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,160
We are in Yiling.

153
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,440
This place is called Burial Mounds.

154
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,920
You, the Yunmeng people, must have heard its resounding name.

155
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,600
It's a mountain of corpses, an old battleground.

156
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
You can dig up a corpse wherever your shovel points.

157
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,480
Countless nameless corpses

158
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,240
are randomly wrapped up and tossed here.

159
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,960
Look at these dark clouds.

160
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,200
Isn't the hatred strong?

161
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,280
Isn't the resentful energy thick?

162
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,760
Even us, the Wen clan, weren't able to repress it.

163
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,000
So we rounded up this place

164
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,640
and prevent people from going in.

165
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,640
Let me tell you.

166
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
This is still daytime.

167
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,000
Wait till the night,

168
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,000
and you'll get to see a marvelous exhibition of all sorts of things.

169
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,520
When a living person goes in,

170
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,280
there is no returning for

171
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,720
neither the body nor the soul.

172
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
No way can he get out.

173
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,040
Ah, Wei Ying.

174
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,840
Let me see if you can keep smiling till the end.

175
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,440
You are going to be trapped here for eternity!

176
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,920
Get inside.

177
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,800
Ning, Ning.

178
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,960
Sis.

179
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,880
Ning, how are you?

180
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,160
Are you alright?

181
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,520
Sis,

182
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,560
I didn't tell them anything.

183
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,160
Sis, how is Childe Wei?

184
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,480
Did Childe Jiang get

185
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,800
his golden core back?

186
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,760
- Wei Wuxian. - Childe Wei.

187
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
Childe Wei. Childe Wei.

188
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian.

189
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,880
Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian.

190
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,920
Childe Wei.

191
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,400
Childe Wei.

192
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,320
- Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian. - Wei Wuxian.

193
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,400
- Senior brother. - Childe Wei.

194
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
Childe Wei.

195
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Senior brother.

196
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,520
Wei Ying.

197
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
Wei Ying.

198
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,080
Wei Ying.

199
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Wei Wuxian, do you want revenge?

200
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,680
- Don't come closer! - Wei Wuxian, let's be together.

201
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,560
Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian.

202
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,800
Do you wanna stay?

203
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,070
Wei Wuxian.

204
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,480
Stay. Do you wanna stay?

205
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,400
Wei Ying.

206
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,480
Stay, Wei Wuxian.

207
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,920
Do you want revenge? Do you want revenge?

208
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
Let's be together.

209
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,560
- Let's be together. - Wanna revenge?

210
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,160
- Wei Wuxian, stay. - Let's be together.

211
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,440
Wei Wuxian, stay. Do you wanna stay?

212
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,240
Stay, Wei Wuxian.

213
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,720
Do you wanna revenge?

214
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,080
Do you wanna revenge?

215
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,640
Let's be together. Let's be together.

216
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,280
Vengeance is ours.

217
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,160
Wei Wuxian, do you wanna revenge?

218
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,984
= Three Months Later =

219
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,960
Jiang clan of Yunmeng?

220
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,120
Lotus Cove?

221
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,600
The young Childe Wen Chao and I

222
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
devastated them all!

223
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
That poor bastard Jiang Cheng,

224
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,680
his golden core

225
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,680
was crushed by Wen Zhuliu.

226
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,240
Disciple of a gentry family? What a joke.

227
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,440
Pooh!

228
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,480
Piece of junk after all.

229
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Boss. Boss.

230
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,000
What about that one...

231
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,040
What about that arrogant Childe?

232
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,120
What was his name again?

233
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
Hmmm... Wei?

234
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Wei Wuxian.

235
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,880
- Yeah. I remember his name.  - Wei Wuxian.

236
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,680
- Yes. That's it.  - He is it.

237
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,480
Childe? Too big a title for him.

238
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,760
Here, here, here.

239
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
He was just a son of a servant.

240
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
In a Yiling teahouse,

241
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
we bunch of folks beat him up

242
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
like a sandbag.

243
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Too bad you weren't there.

244
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,160
You didn't see

245
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,880
the look on his face when he was thrown down.

246
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,640
Yeah.

247
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,440
Do you think he can climb up again?

248
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,880
Be an arrogant brat again?

249
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,480
In the end, our boss is the best.

250
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,120
Yeah! Yeah!

251
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,040
Here, let's toast for boss.

252
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,560
- Come on. - Come on.

253
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,360
- Cheers! - Bottoms up!

254
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,800
Bottoms up.

255
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,480
In my opinion,

256
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,760
we even exterminated Jiang Clan of Yunmeng.

257
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,800
Merely a son of a myrmidon

258
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,080
is nothing.

259
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,160
Right, right, right.

260
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Come on, drink it up!

261
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,600
Drink! Come on, boss.

262
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,360
Who is it?

263
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
Stop playing tricks.

264
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,120
Who is there?

265
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,360
Would it be Wei Wuxian?

266
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,560
Lan Wangji. It's Lan Wangji.

267
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,200
Somebody! Come and get the rebel!

268
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,640
Catch the Lan clan rebel!

269
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Kneel!

270
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,880
Where is Wei Ying?

271
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,080
Speak!

272
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,080
I will. I'll tell you.

273
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,160
We threw Wei Wuxian into Burial Mounds.

274
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,840
There is nothing left of him. Neither skeleton nor soul.

275
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
What are you howling about in the middle of the night?

276
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I had a nightmare again.

277
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
I dreamed of Wei.

278
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,280
I dreamed of him again.

279
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,040
It's been three months since I threw him into Burial Mounds.

280
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,480
Why are you still having dreams about him?

281
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Just how many times has it been?

282
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,080
I… I don't know...

283
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,880
I don't know. I don't know

284
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
why I keep dreaming of him lately.

285
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
Then stay awake.

286
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
Childe. My Childe.

287
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,280
I have been thinking lately.

288
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,480
Did we make a mistake?

289
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,520
A huge mistake?

290
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,680
We tossed him into Burial Mounds.

291
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,560
Maybe he survived?

292
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Maybe he...

293
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,200
No!

294
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,000
Before him, how many cultivators have our clan

295
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
sent to clean up the Burial Mounds?

296
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,720
Did any one of them come back alive?

297
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,760
Now that he's been thrown inside,

298
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,640
his corpse has probably rotten away already.

299
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,360
Even if he’s dead,

300
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,760
just like he said,

301
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,160
he will come back for us.

302
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,200
He will turn into a ferocious ghost and come back to haunt us.

303
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,320
Don't scare yourself.

304
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
Don't you see I have enough trouble?

305
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,040
What Sunshot Campaign?

306
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,200
All useless.

307
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,480
Want to shoot down the sun?

308
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,320
Dream on.

309
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Childe, those clans

310
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
could only keep smiling for a few more days.

311
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,670
I believe Clan Leader Wen will...

312
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Shut up!

313
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,480
Childe Wen,

314
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,960
Wen Qing... Is she...

315
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
Is Wen Qing still held in Yiling?

316
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,240
What's the matter?

317
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,120
You are even scared of Wen Qing now?

318
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,480
Let me tell you something. Her branch of Wen clan

319
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,160
are nothing but our underlings.

320
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,160
They can't cause much trouble.

321
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,360
Who is it?

322
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,040
Childe.

323
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
What a fuss.

324
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,560
What is the matter?

325
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,640
Childe, we got words from Clan Leader Wen.

326
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,400
I heard you. On my way.

327
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Childe, Childe, Childe.

328
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,880
Please do not leave me here alone.

329
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
I am scared, Childe.

330
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,160
I am terrified.

331
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,960
Childe.

332
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,440
Four major clans

333
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,560
gathered in Lanling.

334
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,160
Sunshot Campaign.

335
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,680
War against... against Wen clan.

336
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,480
Qinghe... Qinghe has fallen...

337
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,280
It has been three months.

338
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
We made a deal

339
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
that we would meet up at the teahouse in Yiling.

340
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,040
But until now he never showed up.

341
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,440
I thought...

342
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,000
He took off himself to find you guys in Lanling.

343
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,360
Could it be...

344
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,520
that he really fell into Burial Mounds?

345
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,520
Second Childe Lan.

346
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,400
Second Childe Lan.

347
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
This sword belongs to Childe Wei.

348
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,320
Wei Ying.

349
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Where are you?

350
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,680
Wen Xu is dead?

351
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,490
It was unexpected.

352
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:04,800
= Jin Zixun from Jin clan of Lanling =
It was unexpected.

353
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:04,960
= Jin Zixun from Jin clan of Lanling =

354
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,460
Red Blade Master was such a valiant.
= Jin Zixun from Jin clan of Lanling =

355
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,600
Red Blade Master was such a valiant.

356
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,880
He chopped of Wen Xu's head

357
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,800
with just one swing.

358
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,840
My cousin.

359
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,120
Why you waste a talisman

360
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
on a crow?

361
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,720
These animals

362
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,640
can't often feed on these things.

363
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,560
Why not let them have a big meal today?

364
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,760
Is there a lack of dead bodies these days?

365
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,000
Give out my orders.

366
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,960
Ask our people to help with collecting bodies.

367
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,200
Come and clean this place up.

368
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,960
Yes, Childe.

369
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,480
Nothing can be seen out in travel,

370
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
but corpses covering the plain.

371
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Lady Jiang, we are here.

372
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,320
Thanks for your kindness

373
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,440
these couple of months, Childe Jin.

374
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,600
Now we have arrived at Qinghe,

375
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,360
I shall say goodbye.

376
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,840
Lady Jiang.

377
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,480
Lady Jiang.

378
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,040
Wei Wuxian has entrusted you to me...

379
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,680
...Lanling.

380
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,680
I should wait for Jiang Cheng to deliver you...

381
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,080
Cheng?

382
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
You have news of Cheng?

383
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,160
Sis.

384
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,280
Cheng.

385
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,520
You are okay now. You have recovered.

386
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,960
Sis.

387
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,480
Second Childe Lan,

388
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,920
Congratulations to your successful revenge.

389
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,120
This is?

390
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
This sword belongs to Wei Wuxian.

391
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,640
Did you...?

392
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,840
Qishan Indoctrination Bureau.

393
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,040
It's burnt.

394
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,920
Excellent.

395
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
I brought hundreds of disciples of Jin clan.

396
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,120
I meant to consult with you people

397
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,400
about the attack to Indoctrination Bureau, and get our carry swords.

398
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,360
You're one step ahead.

399
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,670
Oh, right.

400
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,960
Where is Wei Wuxian?

401
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
He asked me to look after his senior sister.

402
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,120
Now I can finally hand her over.

403
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,710
Where is Xian?

404
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,630
Wei Wuxian,

405
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,480
where is he?

406
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,600
Where is Xian?

407
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,560
The Wens treated people with barbarity,

408
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,230
and got their ways by hook or crook.

409
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,560
They shall face the wrath of God and the resentment of men.

410
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,280
Red Blade Master killed a son of Wen Ruohan

411
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,400
It's like crippling one arm of Wen Ruohan.

412
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,960
It's a comfort for the deceased of Jiang.

413
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,840
Our Jiangs will not rest

414
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,160
until Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu are dead.

415
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,480
That's right.

416
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,160
A life for a life.

417
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,640
All Wens

418
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,840
are gonna be executed by this blade.

419
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,840
Now

420
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,320
Langya and Qinghe Supervisory Offices have fallen.

421
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,560
Zeiwu Jun has led the disciples of Lans

422
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,880
back to Cloud Recesses.

423
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,800
It won't take long for them to reclaim the Gusu.

424
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,080
Then all there left are Yunmeng and Yiling.

425
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,760
Red Blade Master.

426
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,280
I requests for a battle assignment.

427
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,720
Red Blade Master.

428
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,920
Me too.

429
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,840
Which battle field have you two chosen?

430
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,880
Yiling.

431
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,360
Yiling...

432
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,240
Yiling is in the Southwest hinterland

433
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,960
next to Qishan's fortress.

434
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,240
It is impregnable.

435
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,360
Red Blade Master.

436
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,840
Okay. You can go.

437
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,280
Take off tomorrow.

438
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,600
But stay away from the main road,

439
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,320
so that you do not alert our enemy.

440
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,920
Childe Jin,

441
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,280
Red Blade Master, how can I help you?

442
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Meng Yao,

443
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,400
has he been behaving himself at Jin clan?

444
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,840
Meng Yao?

445
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,640
Is he serving at Nie clan?

446
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,000
When did he come to Jin clan?

447
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,280
What?

448
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,160
Since we last met at Lan clan,

449
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,920
I haven't seen Meng Yao again.

450
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,960
And...

451
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,640
my father...

452
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,825
my father would not...

453
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,640
Excuse me.

454
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,040
Sis.

455
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,880
It is so late. Why are you still awake?

456
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
It is not easy for us to see each other.

457
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,400
And you will be gone tomorrow.

458
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,920
I can't sleep even if I try.

459
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,000
Sis,

460
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,960
it's all my fault.

461
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,640
I didn't take good care of you,

462
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,040
making you worrying about us every day.

463
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,080
Cheng, my little brother, has grown up.

464
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
As your sister, there is nothing I can do now,

465
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,360
but worrying about you.

466
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,200
Drink it, before it gets cold.

467
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,880
Sis, it tastes great.

468
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,560
Cheng,

469
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,800
please bring Xian back.

470
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,040
Most definitely.

471
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,640
You say Indoctrination Bureau has fallen?

472
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,160
Indoctrination Bureau is at the foot of Qishan.

473
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,760
How can it fall?

474
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,160
My... My Childe...

475
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,800
It has indeed fallen.

476
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,640
And...

477
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,600
His Excellency has requested your

478
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,880
immediate return to Qishan.

479
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,760
Return to Qishan?

480
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,720
For what?

481
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,640
Didn't His Excellency get another right-hand man?

482
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,440
Isn't that guy much favored?

483
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,120
Summon me back for what?

484
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,360
Ask that guy to get everything right.

485
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,640
What should I do? What do I do? What now?

486
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,720
I cannot die. I cannot die here.

487
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,680
Definitely not.

488
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,640
Not with that unreliable man.

489
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
No. No. No.

490
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,480
Shameless bastard, ugly toad!

491
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,400
I don't wanna waste my time on you now.

492
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,720
You're gonna die sooner or later.

493
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,600
Ghost!

494
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
What the hell...
