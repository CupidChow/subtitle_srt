00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 15

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't You Right Each Other

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,780
Company Commander We've found you with the same name and taste the same as the name of Lake.

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:19,140
Can I know his location이라고 did we mention his name with a complicated Developers's name in a way we can't quite understand.

34
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,940
Oh!

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:33,140
do we need to take care of everyone?

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,140
The wine is not too cold.

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
It's cold and has water.

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Ah Xian, don't drink too much.

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,140
Be careful of falling.

40
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
Ah Jie, don't worry about her.

41
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
It's better to fall down.

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Senior sister, say, if it's only the lotus leaves and lotus seeds,

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,140
would it be enough to make wine?

44
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,140
If it's only the lotus seeds,

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
would it be enough to make wine?

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Wei Wuxian, what are you doing?

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,140
Come and help.

48
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
What is the lotus seed?

49
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,140
I've already thought of the name.

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,140
It's called...

51
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,140
The lotus wine.

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,140
Do you want it?

53
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,140
Childe Wei.

54
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,140
Childe Wei.

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,140
Childe Wei.

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,140
Jiang Cheng.

57
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Where are the others?

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,140
Childe Wei, don't worry.

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,140
I've taken the medicine.

60
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,140
It's safe for now.

61
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,140
Childe Jiang, you just got lost.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,140
But he's lost a few ribs.

63
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,140
He's also been beaten to the edge.

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
To the edge?

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,140
Wen Chao got the edge of Jiang's world.

66
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Childe Jiang should have other wounds.

67
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,140
Oh, right.

68
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Childe Jiang's Purple Palace is here.

69
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Thank you.

70
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,140
Childe Wei,

71
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,140
don't say that.

72
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
I've already asked the Chief Jiang

73
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
and Mrs. Jiang to come out.

74
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
We'll talk later.

75
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,140
We can't stay here for long.

76
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,140
Let's go.

77
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,140
Zi Hu.

78
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Jiang Cheng is hurt like this.

79
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,140
Where are you going?

80
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Childe Wei.

81
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
If you believe me,

82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,140
I can take you to a place to hide.

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,140
Childe Jiang needs to take the medicine now.

84
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
He can't stay here for long.

85
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,140
Where are you going?

86
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
To the Medical Hall.

87
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
To find my sister.

88
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
She can heal Childe Jiang.

89
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Thank you, Wen Tian.

90
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Childe Jiang.

91
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
Childe Jiang.

92
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Childe Jiang.

93
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Childe Jiang.

94
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
Wake up.

95
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Wake up.

96
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
What's going on?

97
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,140
I've been taking the medicine.

98
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Who?

99
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,140
Who dares?

100
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,140
Don't waste your energy.

101
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,140
This is a hundred-day sin.

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,140
After drinking,

103
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
you'll be able to recover in a few days.

104
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,140
You'll be able to recover in a few days.

105
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,140
It must be Wei Hu Xian's pet.

106
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
Right.

107
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Let's see if Jiang Cheng is still here.

108
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
I've been there.

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
Jiang Cheng was saved.

110
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
What?

111
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,140
I set up a lotus root here.

112
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,140
I couldn't even get in.

113
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
How did he get away?

114
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Is he really able to get away?

115
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,140
He's not able to get away?

116
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Call all these useless things up.

117
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
I want to be alone.

118
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,140
Cheng.

119
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Cheng.

120
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
What's wrong?

121
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Cheng.

122
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Cheng, what's wrong?

123
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
Childe Jiang just fainted.

124
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
We took him to the doctor.

125
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
You...

126
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Childe Jiang, don't worry.

127
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Childe Wei saved me.

128
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,140
I can't forget about the past.

129
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
Xian.

130
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Li.

131
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
You should go.

132
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Don't delay.

133
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,140
Xian, what are you doing?

134
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Granny.

135
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,140
You should find a place to hide.

136
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
Don't stay here.

137
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,140
The Clan Leader and the wife are gone.

138
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
You're gone too.

139
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,140
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Granny.

141
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,140
We'll be back.

142
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Please help.

143
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Please help.

144
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
Childe.

145
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Childe Wei.

146
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,140
Wei Ning is worse than me.

147
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
He has a check-up.

148
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
I can't stop him.

149
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
That's my fault.

150
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
No, no, no.

151
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,140
It's my fault.

152
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,140
I'll beat myself up.

153
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm not good.

154
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,140
I'm not good.

155
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
It's all my fault.

156
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Put your hands down.

157
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Old man.

158
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Wen Ning.

159
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
That guy is really brave.

160
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,140
Young master.

161
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,140
Wen Ning.

162
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
She's so kind.

163
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
How dare she ruin your grand plan?

164
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Get out of here.

165
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,140
If Wen Ning really saved that guy,

166
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
that would be great.

167
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Wen Zhu,

168
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,140
you should go with me to the forest tomorrow.

169
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Wen Qing was sent to the forest to check on her.

170
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Will Wen Ning go back after saving her?

171
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
What can Wen Ning do?

172
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
She can only go back to Wen Qing

173
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
if she has such a big problem.

174
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
Young master.

175
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,140
If you find out that Wen Ning did it,

176
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,140
what are you going to do with them?

177
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Kill them all together.

178
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
Young master Wei, we're here.

179
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Where are we?

180
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
Let's go in first.

181
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,140
It's too dark here.

182
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Xian.

183
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
Young master Wen is right.

184
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
Let's go in first.

185
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,140
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,140
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,140
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Let's talk later.

191
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,140
This way.

192
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Wait a minute.

193
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Senior sister.

194
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,140
What is this place?

195
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
This is the forest.

196
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I...

197
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Xian.

198
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,140
What are you doing?

199
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Is this the spy room of the forest?

200
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
What is this place

201
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
that you're standing on?

202
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Why did you bring us here?

203
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
What do you want?

204
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Young master Wei, listen to me.

205
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
This is the spy room.

206
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
But it's also where my sister lives.

207
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,140
I...

208
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
I don't think I should hurt you.

209
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
If I want to hurt you,

210
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
after I entered the Lotus House that night,

211
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
I can go back immediately.

212
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,140
It's not necessary to bring you here.

213
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
Young master Wen is now

214
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
searching everywhere.

215
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,140
I can't run around everywhere.

216
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,140
At least the spy room is safe here.

217
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,140
They won't search the spy room.

218
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Xian.

219
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Young master Wen is right.

220
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Don't do this.

221
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Sorry.

222
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
I...

223
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Don't do this, young master Wei.

224
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Let's go in first.

225
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
After my sister comes here,

226
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
we'll...

227
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Open the door!

228
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Open the door!

229
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
Is there anyone?

230
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Open the door!

231
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
Open the door!

232
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
What's going on?

233
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
Open the door!

234
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Open the door!

235
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,140
Open the door!

236
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Open the door!

237
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Open the door!

238
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Open the door!

239
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
It's nothing.

240
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
My brother is back.

241
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
He's sick again.

242
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
You can leave now.

243
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Yes, Young Master.

244
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Young Master.

245
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
No.

246
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
No.

247
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
No.

248
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
Jing.

249
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Father.

250
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
Father.

251
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Father.

252
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Young Master Wei.

253
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
Father.

254
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,140
What happened to

255
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,140
Mu Xishan?

256
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
It's all over.

257
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
I don't need to mention it.

258
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
Then...

259
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,140
Where's Lianhua?

260
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,140
It's fate.

261
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
It's fate.

262
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
It's fate.

263
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
I see.

264
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
What?

265
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
Are you going to kill me now?

266
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
I'm going to see Jiangcheng.

267
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
I'll keep them here.

268
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
My bones are engaged.

269
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Although we haveون't made the assembly,

270
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
we're stable.

271
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
There's nothing serious.

272
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Anyway, you'll leave it there.

273
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
We won't leave any victims in the shed.

274
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
We can do it a few days.

275
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,280
Fan Mixion

276
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,020
Why?

277
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,120
What happened?

278
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,520
What happened?

279
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
I'll be back.

280
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Jiang Cheng.

281
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,140
You're awake.

282
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Do you know who I am?

283
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Can you hear me?

284
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
Jiang Cheng.

285
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,140
Don't scare me.

286
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,140
Jiang Cheng.

287
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
Jiang Cheng.

288
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Talk to me.

289
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Jiang Cheng.

290
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,140
Talk to me.

291
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Don't look at me.

292
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,140
I'll find a way to kill you.

293
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
I'll kill you.

294
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Jiang Cheng.

295
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Okay, okay.

296
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
I'll be better if you hit me.

297
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Do you feel it?

298
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
What do you feel?

299
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
I mean...

300
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
I used the power of time

301
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
in that fight.

302
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,140
I asked you.

303
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Do you feel it?

304
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Okay.

305
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
How about this?

306
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
You hit me again.

307
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Try again.

308
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
No need to hit me.

309
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
The same result

310
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,140
is the same for many more.

311
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Wei Wuxian.

312
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,140
Do you know why

313
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
you have to be called a flower-dancestress?

314
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Because her hands

315
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,140
can draw people's hearts.

316
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
Can people be egg-free?

317
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
The power of time is weak.

318
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Can a normal

319
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,140
flower-dancestress

320
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
flower-dancestress

321
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
be egg-free?

322
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Be egg-free?

323
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Then I can only be old

324
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
in this life.

325
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
I can't let go of my light anymore, right?

326
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Jiang Cheng.

327
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
Do you know

328
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
that my father and mother

329
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
were egg-free

330
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
and killed

331
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
by her in the fight?

332
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
Do you know that?

333
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
Wen Zhuliao.

334
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
Wen Zhuliao.

335
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
I want revenge.

336
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
I want revenge.

337
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
I want revenge.

338
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
But how can I revenge?

339
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
I can't even

340
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
take the sword.

341
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
I can't even take the sword.

342
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
What revenge can I take?

343
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
Wei Wuxian.

344
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Why did you save me?

345
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,140
What's the use of saving me?

346
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
You let me live in this world

347
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
to see the world as a joke.

348
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
I can't do anything.

349
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
I can't.

350
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
Mr. Jiang.

351
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Let me help you up.

352
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,140
Get out of here!

353
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Get out!

354
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
You don't need to pity me.

355
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
I don't want to see

356
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,140
anyone in the world.

357
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,140
I don't want to see you.

358
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
Get out of here!

359
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,140
Get out!

360
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Get out!

361
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Get out!

362
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
Get out!

363
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Get out!

364
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Get out!

365
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Get out!

366
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
Sister.

367
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Two medicines are missing.

368
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Five seeds and a new plant.

369
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Let's re-enact them.

370
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,140
Sister.

371
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
Mr. Jiang.

372
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
He can't recover.

373
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
What?

374
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Sister.

375
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,140
We are going to get revenge.

376
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
Sister.

377
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Save him.

378
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
We have already got revenge.

379
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
Sister.

380
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
What should we do?

381
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Ning.

382
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Remember.

383
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
What Wen Shi did

384
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
doesn't mean what we did.

385
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
We are just doctors.

386
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
We only save people.

387
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
We don't kill people.

388
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
Understand?

389
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Yes.

390
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
He will be better in a few days.

391
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Send him away.

392
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Where?

393
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Wherever he goes.

394
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Have you been to Yunmeng?

395
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Wen Chao is not a fool.

396
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
He will come here soon.

397
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Sister.

398
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Thank you.

399
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
I want to ask you for a favor.

400
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
What?

401
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
I want medical books.

402
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
I want all the medical books

403
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,140
that I can find.

404
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Wei Wuxian.

405
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
You need to rest.

406
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
I want medical books.

407
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
I want medical books.

408
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,140
I want medical books.

409
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
I want medical books.

410
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,140
I want medical books.

411
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Have some food.

412
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
What you did specially for you

413
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
is to be full.

414
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,140
The skin of the Jiang city is almost healed.

415
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
The scar on the border is also gone.

416
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
I will go to the hospital.

417
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
I will go to the hospital.

418
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
I will go to the hospital.

419
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
I will go to the hospital.

420
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
I will go to the hospital.

421
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
I will go to the hospital.

422
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
I will eat and drink and sleep.

423
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,140
Your sister asked me to go to sleep with Yin Zhen.

424
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
Go and see your sister.

425
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,140
She is worried about you.

426
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Xiang Zhong.

427
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,140
You will definitely recover soon.

428
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,140
hardness

429
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,140
Bo Cheng

430
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
You have to hurry.

431
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Dad said

432
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
theônr village of Jiang,

433
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
couldn't handle a hurricane but because of it.

434
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Don't give up.

435
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Ah Xian and I will find a way.

436
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Sister.

437
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Ah Xian.

438
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Sister.

439
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,140
Sister, you are not well.

440
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,140
Don't be in a good mood.

441
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Go to rest.

442
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,140
Ah Xian.

443
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Come here.

444
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
Sister.

445
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Ah Xian.

446
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,140
Ah Xian.

447
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
You are tired.

448
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
No, I am not tired.

449
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
I still need to read books.

450
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,140
I must remember the way to restart the egg.

451
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
But there are really too few books here.

452
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
If I am not sure about the difference in the cloud,

453
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,140
no, the cloud is not sure about the difference in the sky.

454
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
The old flag is gone.

455
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
Who else can help me?

456
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Lan Zhan.

457
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Lan Zhan will help me.

458
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,140
Sister.

459
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Ah Xian.

460
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
Come here.

461
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Ah Xian.

462
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
You are tired.

463
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
You need to rest.

464
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,140
I don't want Ah Cheng to wake up and you will be under the knife.

465
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Sister.

466
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
Sister.

467
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
Maybe it's all my fault.

468
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
What did you say?

469
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Maybe it's all my fault

470
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
as Mrs. Yu said.

471
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
What did I blame you for?

472
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
Did you kill me?

473
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Did you kill me?

474
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
Did you kill me?

475
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
Did you lose your gold medal?

476
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
I have done everything.

477
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Who is useful to me?

478
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
What can I change?

479
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Ah Xian.

480
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I am gone.

481
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Ah Cheng is sick.

482
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
I only rely on myself now.

483
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
You are my only family.

484
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
I really can't lose you.

485
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Then I am really alone.

486
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
Sister.

487
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
Sister.

488
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Ah Xian.

489
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,140
You promised me

490
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
that we would return to Lotus.

491
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Have you forgotten?

492
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Sister.

493
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Sister.

494
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,140
Sister made it that night.

495
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
She was full of strength.

496
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,140
Sister.

497
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
Sister.

498
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
Sister.

499
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
Sister.

500
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
Sister.

501
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
Sister.

502
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
I found the way to save Jiang Cheng.

503
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Listen to me, Miss Wen.

504
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,140
No.

505
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,140
I said no, you can't.

506
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Think about it.

507
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
This is the only way to save Jiang Cheng.

508
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
Miss Wen, think about it.

509
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
You can't do that.

510
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
But if you don't do that,

511
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,140
we have no other way.

512
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
I can't do that.

513
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
You.

514
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Sister.

515
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
What's wrong?

516
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,140
Do you know?

517
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,140
What's the price for you to do that?

518
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,140
You.

519
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
You just need to help me.

520
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
Leave the rest to me.

521
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,140
Sister.

522
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,140
If it's because of Jiang Cheng's injury,

523
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
you can save him.

524
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
They all have grudges for me.

525
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
After healing,

526
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,140
let them go.

527
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
Wen Chang won't find out.

528
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
You know Jiang Cheng.

529
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,140
He is too strong.

530
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
He is too focused.

531
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
He is his life.

532
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,140
If he can only be a normal person,

533
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
then he is dead.

534
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
What about you?

535
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
Sister.

536
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,140
I only have five percent of the power.

537
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,140
Five percent is fine.

538
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Half and half.

539
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Brother.

540
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Brother.

541
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
Brother.
