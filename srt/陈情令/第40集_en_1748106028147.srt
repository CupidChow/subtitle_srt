1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I thought it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I thought it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought it was a black cat.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I thought it was a black cat.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I thought it was a black cat.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Episode 19

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's really a waste of time.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You guys are so slow.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What did Wei Wuxian do?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He was so close.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why did he talk to you?

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's so strange.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Did he want to give Wei Ying a chance to get rid of her?

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I didn't mean to give her a chance.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I just suggest that you don't follow the conclusion

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
before you know the truth.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That year, he was killed by a evil spirit.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He killed many people.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He killed you and the Tiger's Talisman.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a fact that I can't prove.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Can't he still make a conclusion?

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He killed my father and killed my mother.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will never forget that.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What else can I do?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why did you guys come here to fight?

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's not mention it.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The food is getting cold.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Right.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's the good of fighting?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's just that he's not a good guy.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He said it without hesitation.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hurry up and eat, Miss.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We're all hungry.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We just came out of the city.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a very good deal.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You will have a talk tomorrow.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We can't fight here.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was wrong.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please sit down, Mr. Jin.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you continue to fight,

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you will have to...

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What would you like?

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Xiu.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, you go up.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Siren.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's go.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sir, your wine.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Eat.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's wrong?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I just got the wine.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry, Miss.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I just got the wine.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're welcome.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll go and get it.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll go.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Miss Jiang's son.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Wen Ying.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wen Ying.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I...

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Here you are.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wine?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wine.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Good wine.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Lan Zhan.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't you want to drink with me?

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Brother.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Get out.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Jiang Cheng knows who you are.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How can I know?

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I'm really curious.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How do you recognize me?

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm curious too.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're a good friend.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm curious too.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why are you so close to each other?

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I hope I'm not too close to each other.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Next month,

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we'll go to the Golden Forest.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why are you going there?

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm still missing my phone.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So you think

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mr. Chi Feng's head will be hidden by him?

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If Mr. Chi Feng's head

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is really on the Golden Forest,

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that will prove our speculation.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But Zewu Jun...

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Zewu Jun.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr. Wei is right.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The situation is serious.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Please take him to the Golden Forest.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I can find the evidence,

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll take the public opinion.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Gu Su Lanshi, enter the city.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go.

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Zewu Jun.

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mr. Jiang.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The light show.

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You've never seen the light show

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
at the Golden Forest's youth conference.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How are you interested in it this time?

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm interested in it.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're interested in it?

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm interested in it.

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm interested in it.

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm interested in it.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm interested in it.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Zewu Jun.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I've never seen it outside.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mr. Xian never brought it.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What's going on this time?

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a mess.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I wonder which famous man

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
has been hidden by Jiang Meng?

141
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Zewu Jun.

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Brother.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Brother.

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And Wang Ji also came.

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Brother.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You even know to call me uncle.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh, Mr. Jiang,

150
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
Lin has known it wrong.

151
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,160
He was afraid you would punish him

152
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,560
and he couldn't even eat.

153
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
He couldn't sleep well.

154
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,680
He's a naughty boy.

155
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
You love him the most.

156
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,240
Don't argue with him.

157
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,920
Right.

158
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
Uncle can testify for me.

159
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,760
I'm not good at all these days.

160
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,600
You're not good at all?

161
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,640
You're so angry.

162
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,240
You don't eat much.

163
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,280
Why are you here?

164
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,400
I...

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,040
I'm here to serve you.

166
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,320
You're here to shout?

167
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,760
I...

168
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,480
Enough.

169
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
It's time.

170
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,280
I don't dare to say anything else.

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,720
You must eat enough.

172
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,600
Brother,

173
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,760
sit inside.

174
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I'll go there and have a look.

175
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,840
I'll arrange for you.

176
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,280
No need to bother.

177
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
How can this be a bother?

178
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,240
Come to me.

179
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
Don't tell me anything.

180
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Please.

181
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,680
I'll arrange for you.

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,440
All of you.

183
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,920
Let's go.

184
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,320
Let's go.

185
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,500
Brother...

186
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Brother Akbar's scams.

187
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,720
Where did my

188
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
performance go?

189
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,100
Brother Akbar,

190
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,100
Ling Qi.

191
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,080
Brother Akbar has given updle a

192
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,280
training round playing along,

193
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,780
who fairly succeed well and

194
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,600
accomplished his goal in master competitions

195
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,960
for someone falling in the sunset.

196
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
If Iceğin notice the achievementat

197
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,820
and make something of it,

198
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,160
I would really feel regretful.

199
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,720
This name is Mon Qu Yuan,

200
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
and this name is an unknown name.

201
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,300
It is a gesture ofership,

202
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,640
an animal,

203
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,680
just that once out of the blue,

204
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,960
you will Tie Liao Liao.

205
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
éd

206
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,460
dad

207
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,600
just because

208
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

209
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

210
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

211
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

212
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

213
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

214
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

215
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

216
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

217
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

218
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

219
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

220
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

221
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I can't even even think of this.

222
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
It's not expected.

223
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm afraid your invincibility is met.

224
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
You need to know.

225
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I don't want to go anywhere.

226
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Don't go anywhere.

227
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:19,980
This is Kusد

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,120
Who dares to force my Wijun palace?

229
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,540
K floating there,

230
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,740
For the affairs

231
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
He tries to question

232
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,540
It's J

233
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
Heum

234
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,900
In the firm seeds of your heart

235
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,680
Should it be you

236
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,440
Who dares to approach

237
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
cence

238
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
Brother!

239
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
What's wrong with you?

240
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
Say something.

241
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Brother, what should I do?

242
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
You have to help me.

243
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
This is the last time.

244
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
This is the last time.

245
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,980
Didn't I help you with your last mission?

246
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,980
The last mission was solved.

247
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,980
This is a new one.

248
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Brother.

249
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Brother, what's wrong?

250
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Say something.

251
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Brother, what should I do?

252
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
You don't want to help me?

253
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
I'll die for you.

254
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
Su, you go back first.

255
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,980
That...

256
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Huaizong, let's find a place to sit.

257
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
Brother, what's wrong?

258
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
What should I do?

259
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Brother.

260
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Brother.

261
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Brother.

262
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
What should I do?

263
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
Brother.

264
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,980
You really want to help me?

265
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Lord Han.

266
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,980
If there's anything you need to do today,

267
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
please forgive me.

268
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Then, I'll go first.

269
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,980
It's so weird to see me in the eyes of those who are watching me.

270
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,980
What did this Mo Xuan Yu do?

271
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,980
I'm not a person who is missing for a moment.

272
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
But what's wrong with this?

273
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,980
What's wrong with you?

274
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
You're not the one who's missing for a moment.

275
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
What's wrong with you?

276
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
What's wrong with this?

277
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
How about this, Lan Zhan?

278
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
I'll find someone to talk to.

279
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
Jiang Cheng, please keep an eye on me.

280
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,980
If he doesn't come to me, that's the best.

281
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
If he comes to me,

282
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,980
please help me.

283
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Li Zou Yu.

284
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
I got it.

285
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
We'll see each other tonight.

286
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,980
I remember your identity.

287
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,980
Wait for me.

288
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
I'll go first.

289
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Why are you here?

290
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
I...

291
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
I thought I was wrong.

292
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
It's really him.

293
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,980
I...

294
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
You're not the one who's missing.

295
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Mo Xuan Yu.

296
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
You're still here.

297
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Jin Chan.

298
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
What are you doing here?

299
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,980
It's none of your business.

300
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
None of my business.

301
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
Is it your business?

302
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
What do you want me to do?

303
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Don't mess around.

304
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,980
What do you mean?

305
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,980
I'm teaching you how to teach a girl to do something.

306
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
She's already been kicked out.

307
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
She's not one of our family's members.

308
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
So what?

309
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
So what?

310
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Don't you know who she's coming with today?

311
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
If you want to teach her,

312
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
you should ask the Han State Army.

313
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Jin Ling,

314
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,980
you used to hate her a lot.

315
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
Why did you suddenly change her today?

316
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Why are you talking nonsense?

317
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
If I don't hate her,

318
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
what does it have to do with you?

319
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
This person is a woman who doesn't know how to be shameless

320
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
and shameless.

321
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
What right do you have to talk to her?

322
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Mo Xuan Yu.

323
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Who's not good at being shameless?

324
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
You're going to be a woman who's shameless.

325
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
You're going to die.

326
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
Don't talk nonsense.

327
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
I'm going to beat you.

328
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
You're going to beat me if you want to.

329
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
You're afraid you won't do it.

330
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,980
Do you want me to teach you a lesson?

331
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm not a teacher today.

332
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Even if I'm not a teacher,

333
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,980
I can beat you to death.

334
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
You...

335
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
Why are you still here?

336
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
What are you doing?

337
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Are you looking for death?

338
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
Did you learn it?

339
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
What?

340
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
No.

341
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
It hurts.

342
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
It hurts.

343
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Zeyuan, are you still going to beat me?

344
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
No, I'm not going to.

345
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Jianing, wait for me.

346
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I'll go get it.

347
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
You're so happy.

348
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,980
You won the first time.

349
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm the one who won the game.

350
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,980
But Jinchuan always finds a good helper.

351
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
He's shameless.

352
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Who taught you that trick?

353
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Han Guangjun taught me.

354
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Han Guangjun?

355
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Yes.

356
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
He taught you this?

357
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Of course.

358
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
I'm telling you.

359
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
This is the first time you've used this trick.

360
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
If you use it more,

361
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,980
they'll break you.

362
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,980
It's not that easy.

363
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,980
How about learning a few more tricks with me?

364
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Why are you like this?

365
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
My uncle told me to do it.

366
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
He even used me.

367
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
Tell you what?

368
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Don't fight with others.

369
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
You need to get along with them.

370
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
That's about it.

371
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
I'm telling you.

372
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Don't listen to him.

373
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
When you grow up,

374
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,980
you'll find more people you want to fight with.

375
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
But at that time,

376
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,980
you have to get along with them.

377
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
So, when you're still young,

378
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,980
you can fight with anyone.

379
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Really?

380
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
Of course.

381
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
You're not that old.

382
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,980
You're not that good at fighting with others.

383
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Your life is not perfect.

384
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
What are you talking about?

385
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
My uncle is doing it for my own good.

386
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
Okay.

387
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
By the way,

388
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,980
why are you here?

389
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Are you still...

390
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
I...

391
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm telling you the truth.

392
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Don't tell anyone.

393
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,980
I've already broken up with you.

394
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
I found out that

395
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Mrs. Jin is not the type of person

396
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
I thought she would be.

397
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
And she's not very good at fighting.

398
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
So, I came here

399
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,980
to apologize to her.

400
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
Don't be so mean.

401
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
I'll let you go

402
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
if you don't say anything.

403
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I...

404
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Are you Mo Xun Yu?

405
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,980
You've seen me before.

406
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Mo Xun Yu has been crazy.

407
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
She's been telling me that

408
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
she's been acting like a fool.

409
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
She's not just a mask.

410
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Who knows what she looks like?

411
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
You...

412
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Forget it.

413
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
It doesn't matter who you are.

414
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Since you're wearing this mask,

415
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
don't show up here anyway.

416
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
I'll make you misunderstand

417
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
if you don't show up here.

418
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
I'll give you three points.

419
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
If you don't leave,

420
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
I'll call the late Mr. Han.

421
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Three.

422
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Two.

423
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
You kid.

424
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
Why are you talking like a dog?

425
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I'm sorry.

426
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Man Zhan.

427
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
I'm sorry.

428
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
It's good.

429
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Man Zhan.

430
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,980
I think I'm drunk.

431
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Don't make a fuss.

432
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Be careful in this area.

433
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm sorry.

435
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
I'm sorry.

436
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,980
What's going on?

438
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,980
The name of the house is very good.

439
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Su.

440
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,980
What are you doing?

441
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,980
What's in your hand?

442
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Su.

443
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
You're not looking right.

444
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
I'm sorry.

446
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
I'm not looking right.

447
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
What's wrong?

448
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
I met someone.

449
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
He told me something.

450
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
He even gave me a letter.

451
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
What person?

452
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
What did he say?

453
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Do you believe him?

454
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
He won't lie to me.

455
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
He won't.

456
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,980
Is this letter true?

457
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
It's not true.

458
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,980
It's all a fake.

459
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
It's a fake.

460
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
You're lying to me.

461
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,980
You still want to lie to me?

462
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Su.

463
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
I'm telling the truth.

464
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
You don't believe me.

465
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
I'm in a difficult situation.

466
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Oh, my god.

467
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
Oh, my god.

468
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
You're really...

469
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
You're really scary.

470
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
How can you do this?

471
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
How can you do this?

472
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,980
What's in that letter?

473
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
Did Jin Guangyao kill Chi Fengze?

474
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
Or did he do it in Mo Xuan Yu's case?

475
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
No.

476
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
These two things

477
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
are not as intense as they seem.

478
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
They're so sudden.

479
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
Su.

480
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
We've been married for many years.

481
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
We've been together for many years.

482
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
We've been together for many years.

483
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,980
We've been together for many years.

484
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
We've been together for many years.

485
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
We've been together for many years.

486
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
As a husband,

487
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I've been asking you a lot.

488
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
You really

489
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
hurt my heart.

490
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,980
You treat me well.

491
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
But I...

492
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
I've never met you.

493
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,980
No wonder

494
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
you never

495
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
knew me.

496
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
You're better off

497
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
killing me.

498
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Su.

499
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
You didn't know that

500
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
we've been together

501
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
before this.

502
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
It's nothing.

503
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
It won't

504
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
cause you any harm.

505
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
It's just a misunderstanding.

506
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
To be honest,

507
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Su.

508
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,980
How did Su die?

509
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
Su.

510
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Didn't you know that?

511
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Our son was killed by someone else.

512
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
I've cleaned up

513
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
the person who killed him

514
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
and made him hate me.

515
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Why did you do this to him?

516
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
I know that.

517
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
But I suspect

518
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
what I knew before

519
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
is all fake.

520
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
Su.

521
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
What are you thinking about?

522
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
Su is my son.

523
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
What do you think I'll do to him?

524
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Do you believe

525
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
a person who has a secret

526
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
and a secret letter

527
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
that you don't believe me?

528
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
It's because he's your son

529
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
that I feel terrible.

530
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
What do you think I'll do to you?

531
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
You can even do

532
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
this.

533
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
What else

534
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,980
do you dare not do?

535
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Stop thinking about it.

536
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Tell me.

537
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Who did you meet today?

538
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
Who gave you this letter?

539
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
You...

540
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,980
What are you going to do?

541
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
That person can tell you

542
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
and tell others.

543
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
If you can write one letter,

544
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
you can write the second one,

545
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
and the third one,

546
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
and countless letters.

547
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
What are you going to do?

548
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
Do you think this matter

549
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
will be ruled out?

550
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
Su.

551
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Even if I beg you,

552
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,980
no matter what you look at,

553
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,980
tell me.

554
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
Who gave you this letter?

555
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
Who is it?

556
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
This person wants to

557
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
steal the secret letter

558
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
of Jin Guangyao.

559
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
He must want Jin Guangyao to be a good person.

560
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
But I don't know

561
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
if this person

562
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
and Zhiying

563
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
are the same person

564
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,980
who we found

565
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
in Shi Feng's body.

566
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
Su.

567
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
You're not human.

568
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
You're a lunatic.

569
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Su.

570
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,980
I really didn't

571
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
have a second way to go.

572
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
I planned to keep you

573
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
for the rest of my life.

574
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
I didn't want you to know this.

575
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
But now,

576
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,980
the person who was told

577
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,980
about you is completely gone.

578
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
You think I'm a liar?

579
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
You think I'm a liar?

580
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm a liar?

581
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
It's nothing.

582
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
But if this thing is

583
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
spread out,

584
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
you're my wife.

585
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,980
How will others

586
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
think of you?

587
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Stop talking.

588
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Stop reminding me.

589
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
I have nothing to do

590
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
with you.

591
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
I know

592
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
you won't believe

593
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,980
what I say.

594
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
But I was sincere.

595
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
I remember

596
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
you never said anything

597
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
to me

598
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
for the rest of my life.

599
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
I'm grateful to you

600
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
for all my life.

601
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
I also want to ask you

602
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
to love and love you.

603
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
But you have to know

604
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
that others don't harm Su.

605
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Su must die.

606
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
He can only die.

607
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
If he keeps growing up,

608
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
you and I...

609
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
So

610
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
who did this to you?

611
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
What else

612
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
can you do

613
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
for this position?

614
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
Su,

615
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
you really don't want to tell me?

616
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
Tell you what?

617
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Tell you what?

618
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,980
Do you want me to

619
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
kill you?

620
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
Su,

621
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
you're so stupid.

622
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Yuanzhang has been out of Yunyou

623
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
for a while.

624
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
I've sent you out

625
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,980
recently.

626
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
I'm happy

627
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
to share the happiness

628
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,980
with him.

629
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,980
Let's finish this.

630
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
There are many guests outside.

631
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
There will be a forum tomorrow.

632
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Yes, now

633
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,980
you're still thinking about your guests.

634
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
I'm sorry.

635
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
I'm sorry.

636
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,980
I'm sorry.

637
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
I'm sorry.

638
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
I'm sorry.

644
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
I'm sorry.

645
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,980
I'm sorry.

646
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
I'm sorry.

647
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
I'm sorry.

648
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Don't be afraid.

651
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
You're not

652
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
going anywhere

653
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,980
because of the situation.

654
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
You should rest here

655
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
for a few days.

656
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
As long as you tell me

657
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
who the person is,

658
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
you can come back.

659
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
If you want to say something,

660
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
just nod your head.

661
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
I didn't seal your whole body.

662
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
You can

663
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
do it.

664
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
I'm sorry.

665
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,980
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
Yunmeng,

667
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Yunping City.

668
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,980
Yunmeng,

669
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
Yunmeng City.

670
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
Su,

671
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
I'll go and have a look.

672
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
I'll see you later.

673
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,980
Su,

674
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
Su,

675
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Su,

676
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
were you looking at me?

677
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
You haven't let go

679
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
for so many years.

680
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Su,

681
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
Su,

682
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,980
Su,

683
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
I'm sorry.

684
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
Su,

685
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,980
Su.

686
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,980
Su,

687
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,980
Su,

688
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
Su,

689
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
Su,

690
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,980
Su,

691
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,300
P-P-Everyone...

692
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,260
is gone...

693
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:46,980
Like a little sasa, there is wind and waves

694
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,980
The world is full of grace

695
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,980
Like a little baby, how old is she?

696
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
I'm still not sure

697
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,980
Like a little sasa, there is wind and waves

698
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,980
The world is full of grace
