00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 05

3
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Is there really a secret in the back hill of Cloud Recesses?

4
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,560
Bro Ji, it's you.

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
Bro Ji, I did not do it on purpose.

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,160
The fault is also yours.

7
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,120
You came silently.

8
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,100
I was not even get prepared.

9
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Bro Ji,

10
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,680
tell you a secret.

11
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
I just heard some noise in the back hill.

12
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,150
I guess someone has sneaked into the back hill.

13
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,720
Is it related to the spirit snatch?

14
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
Wait!

15
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,240
How can you drag me in this way?

16
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
It hurts!

17
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
It does hurt!

18
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,280
Beautiful calligraphy.

19
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
It's beyond the best.

20
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
Bro Wangji.

21
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,960
Lan Wangji.

22
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,000
Lan Zhan!

23
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
Can you stop looking at me in that way?

24
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,560
It's you who ignore me first.

25
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,720
That's why I call your formal name.

26
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,320
If you're upset,

27
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,080
you can call me in the same way.

28
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Put down your leg.

29
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,840
As you say.

30
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
By the way, Wangji.

31
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
I wanna ask you a question,

32
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,240
why do you hate me so much?

33
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Second Childe Lan,

34
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,000
how can you ignore me again after a few words.

35
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,120
I apologize

36
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,720
and admit my fault.

37
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Yes, at that night

38
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,720
I should not climb the wall,

39
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,320
drink alcohol,

40
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,240
and fight with you.

41
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,360
But I swear,

42
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,960
I really know nothing of

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,240
your family rules.

44
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,280
Otherwise, I would never drink the Emperor's Smile

45
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,680
in front of you.

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,000
I would take it back and drink it secretly in my room.

47
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,120
And I have to clear the truth.

48
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
It was you

49
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,800
who fought first.

50
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,600
If you did not hit me,

51
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
we could have a chat.

52
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
As for me,

53
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,200
if someone hit me first,

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
I will absolutely hit him back.

55
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
So this thing,

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm not the only one to blame.

57
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Are you listening, young master?

58
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,480
May I have the honor to get a glimpse from you.

59
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,500
Transcribe the text one more time.

60
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,240
Come on.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,000
I have apologized.

62
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,150
Not in a sincere way.

63
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,120
Absolute sincerely.

64
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,440
I'll apologized continually to your heart's content.

66
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
I can even kneel down to you.

67
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,280
Sister,

68
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,800
where are you going, sister?

69
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
Sister,

70
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,440
since you came to Gusu,

71
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,880
I couldn't see you often.

72
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,520
You...

73
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,040
Are you really looking for something?

74
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,200
Remember,

75
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,760
the clips of Yin Iron,

76
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,360
is same as that in Dafan mountain.

77
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,420
You must remember.

78
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,580
Go find it.

79
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Bring it back.

80
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Sister,

81
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,560
I won't ask,

82
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
don't get too tired.

83
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
Ning,

84
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
since you came to Cloud Recesses,

85
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,220
have you felt something strange?

86
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
No, No.

87
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Sister, I have had all the medicine you gave me.

88
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Our family has been doctors for centuries,

89
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,920
but I can't cure my own brother.

90
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
If it were not for...

91
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
Sis,

92
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
stop it.

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Ning,

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,560
I will take you away from Nevernight

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,400
sooner or later.

96
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,840
have you transcribed all the books?

97
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,760
It's done.

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,600
By the way,

99
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
I won't come from tomorrow.

100
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,040
This,

101
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
is your gift.

102
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,240
Right.

103
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,240
I forget to add something.

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,840
Done.

105
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,640
Boring?

106
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,560
I know you will say boring.

107
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
Can you change a word

108
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,240
or add some new ones?

109
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,720
Extremely boring.

110
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,480
You do add something.

111
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,640
Thank you so much.

112
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,560
Wei Ying.

113
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,040
Yes yes yes!

114
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,360
Lan Zhan.

115
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Behave yourself!

116
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,680
I bring my sword, too.

117
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,440
Don't you want your library?

118
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,280
Shameless.

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why are you ashamed of this?

120
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't tell me you've never read a book like this.

121
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
I don't believe it.

122
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360
Go outside.

123
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,320
Let's have a duel.

124
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
No no no.

125
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,560
Fight is prohibited, don't you know?

126
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,520
Lan Zhan!

127
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
No no no!

128
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,080
Lan Zhan.

129
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Lan Zhan.

130
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,960
What a ruin! You!

131
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
Piss off.

132
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
Lan Zhan,

133
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
people say you're a noble gentleman

134
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,920
like the rarest pearl.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
No one can be more courteous than you.

136
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
But you are just so so.

137
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,320
Cloud Recesses prohibit making a noise

138
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,360
but you dare ask me to piss off.

139
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,520
OK, I'll just piss off.

140
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
I'm good at this anyway.

141
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,470
Don't need to walk me out.

142
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,160
He ask you to piss off?

143
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,960
Bro Wei,

144
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
you are unbelievable.

145
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,600
It's the first time I hear Lan Wangji say piss off.

146
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,320
How can you make it happen, Bro Wei?

147
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,480
It's my pleasure

148
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,760
to help him break the ban.

149
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll tell everyone

150
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,520
that I am the first one.

151
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,680
Why are you so proud?

152
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,880
What are you proud of?

153
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,720
Is it a pride to be asked to piss off?

154
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,360
Our family is disgraced because of you.

155
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,840
I did appologize to him.

156
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,480
He not only refused it but also punish me to keep silence.

157
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
Why can't I play a trick on him?

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,040
It's a pity that I lost the Rare Beauty Collection

159
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
I got from Nie.

160
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,960
I didn't get time to have a look.

161
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,110
I gave him but received malice. Good for him,

162
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,080
It's a waste of his face.

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,080
Never mind.

164
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,000
I got a plenty of those.

165
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Right.

166
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,080
Did you say my name?

167
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,720
Am I the kind of traitor?

168
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,000
You offended both Lan Wangji and Lan Qiren.

169
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
You are dead.

170
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,640
Nobody will remedy it.

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Jiang Cheng.

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,400
Why do you think so much?

173
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
Play tricks first.

174
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,640
Besides,

175
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
You've helped me for so many times,

176
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,680
just do it for me one more time.

177
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,920
If it happens again,

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,960
don't tell me

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,120
and don't let me see it.

180
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,380
Piss off!

181
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Isn't it owl of Wen clan of Qishan?

182
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,360
Why is it here?

183
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,800
Wen clan of Qishan?

184
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,480
How do you know it is their owl?

185
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,760
Our Qinghe is at the foot of Qishan.

186
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,320
We see this kind of owl very often.

187
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
It is said

188
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,840
the owls are the supervisor of Wen Clan.

189
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,600
Then why do the owl fly to Cloud Recesses?

190
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't know.

191
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Can the Wen Clan control everything,

192
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,830
even us auditors?

193
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,400
Brother,

194
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
Recently, something strange happened inside the wards of the back hill.

195
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
Though the wards has not been broken yet,

196
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
it has been disrupted.

197
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,160
Did you find who had got into the back hill?

198
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
Wei Ying.

199
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,920
Brother, do we need to reinforce the ward?

200
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
The ward is set by the ancestors.

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
As long as she doesn't go inside,

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,840
the ward will not break.

203
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,520
She?

204
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,440
Forget about this.

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,680
Wangji.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,800
Clan Leader.

207
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,220
Clan Leader. Second Childe.

208
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,360
Forego formalities.

209
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,560
What's the matter?

210
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,720
= Su She,courtesy name is min Shan =

211
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,570
The villagers came to report that
= Su She,courtesy name is min Shan =

212
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,000
The villagers came to report that

213
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,520
Caiyi Town is haunted by the water ghosts these days.

214
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,240
There are lots of victims.

215
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,840
The villagers are petitioning for

216
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
the help of Lan Clan.

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,480
Water ghosts?

218
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,240
The people in Caiyin Town are good at swimming,

219
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,280
drowning rarely happens.

220
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,760
Where do the water ghosts come from?

221
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,880
Well...

222
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,480
I don't know.

223
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,040
Clan Leader, do you need me to do the exorcism?

224
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
Reply the villagers for me.

225
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,480
I will go there in person tomorrow morning.

226
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,520
And do the exorcism.

227
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
Clan Leader has been busy these days.

228
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,720
I can do the job

229
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,920
to rid these water ghosts

230
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
which grow from water-living critters.

231
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,520
I think this may not be that easy.

232
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,120
Just prepare for it.

233
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,400
Yes.

234
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,080
Wangji, go with me tomorrow.

235
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,960
Yes.

236
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Senior Sister.

237
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,160
Senior Sister.

238
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,520
Miss Wen.

239
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,080
Miss Wen.

240
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,680
Childe Jiang.

241
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,400
Miss Wen.

242
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,080
Why are you here?

243
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,200
Miss Wen.

244
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,140
Why do you ignore me?

245
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,840
Xian, here you are.

246
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
I'm here.

247
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,600
Senior Sister, why do you come?

248
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,160
It's been rainy these days.

249
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,360
I felt dizzy when I went to the river bank this morning.

250
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
It was lucky that I met Miss Wen.

251
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,120
Not only did she come back with me,

252
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,960
but she also gave me some medicine.

253
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,520
I've got better now.

254
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,960
Sis, why don't you tell us that

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
you are sick?

256
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,240
The fuddy-duddy is to blame.

257
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
He put me in confinement for three days.

258
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,320
Senior Sister must be sick because of missing me.

259
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,830
Miss Wen.

260
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,240
Thank you so much.

261
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,830
You're welcome, Childe Jiang.

262
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:20,880
I'm a doctor.

263
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,800
It's my duty to cure people.

264
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
Senior Sister, I've heard that Childe Lan

265
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,200
have been to the Qinghe for the Cultivation Conference.

266
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,080
So in these days,

267
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
we don't have to audit courses.

268
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,720
And I've heard that Zewu Jun is going to the town for hunting

269
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
and do the exorcism of water ghosts.

270
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,920
If we set off now,

271
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
we can catch them up.

272
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,840
Water ghosts?

273
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,800
Yes.

274
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,840
It is said that Caiyi Town is haunted by the water ghosts these days.

275
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
It's really strange.

276
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,360
Zewu Jun.

277
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,560
- Zewu Jun. - Zewu Jun.

278
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,760
Childe Wei, Childe Jiang.

279
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,920
You...

280
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,640
Zewu Jun.

281
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
It's said that there are water ghosts near the Biling Lake.

282
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
And we don't need to audit these days.

283
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,920
So we want to go practice with Zewu Jun.

284
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,640
Yes, yes, let us go with you.

285
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,960
It's against the rules.

286
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
Why?

287
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,760
Our Yunmeng is a brooky area.

288
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,680
Jiang Cheng and I played near waters in our childhood.

289
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,920
Water Ghosts are so easy for us.

290
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,120
Besides, we don't have courses these days.

291
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Right, Zewu Jun.

292
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Yunmeng has so many rivers.

293
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
We can help you for sure.

294
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,240
We don't need.

295
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,600
Then two childes please follow me.

296
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,200
Clan Leader Lan.

297
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,240
I want to broaden my horizon, too.

298
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,160
Zewu Jun, Miss Wen is well versed in medicine.

299
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,680
Although the water ghosts are easy to deal with,

300
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,200
some ordinary villager

301
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,720
may be hurt during the exorcism,

302
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,720
and she can do the job to cure.

303
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,440
Then Miss Wen go with us, please.

304
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,720
Sis,

305
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,160
sis, wait for me.

306
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,240
Wen Ning.

307
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,240
Why do you come?

308
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,960
I've told you, I...

309
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,520
Sis, I've heard that

310
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
you are going to do the exorcism of water ghosts.

311
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,320
I wanna go with you

312
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,120
to see the ghosts.

313
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,080
Ning,

314
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,120
it might be very dangerous.

315
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
I asked you to stay at home, why don't you listen?

316
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,160
I...

317
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,960
Miss Wen,

318
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,880
your brother is so talented,

319
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,240
and he is a vastly superior archer.

320
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,360
I think nothing will go wrong.

321
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,440
And,

322
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,160
I'll protect him.

323
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
It'll be alright.

324
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Simple as an exorcism of water ghost,

325
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,040
it won't be that dangerous.

326
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Clan Leader Lan,

327
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
my brother is so young and impolite,

328
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,200
he came here because of his curiosity for water ghosts,

329
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,560
as Qishan is mountainous and dry.

330
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
But Clan Leader Lan, don't worry,

331
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,600
Ning and I will never interrupt the exorcism.

332
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,880
Forgive us

333
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,520
and allow my brother go with us, please.

334
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,400
Never mind, Miss Wen.

335
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,160
Since he came, let him go with us.

336
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,640
Brother, why do you take them?

337
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,720
It's not an easy case,

338
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,640
no time for joke.

339
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,960
I just looked at you,

340
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,760
you seemed to want the two boys

341
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,400
to go together,

342
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
so I said yes.

343
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,840
Don't you want?

344
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
Two guests, welcome.

345
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,080
Your place looks

346
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
a little dirty.

347
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
Sir, forgive me.

348
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
To be honest,

349
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,680
since the lake started to eat human beings,

350
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,480
our inn

351
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,720
hasn't had guest for a long time.

352
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,080
You two are the first guests since then.

353
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,440
So please help yourself.

354
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Eat human?

355
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,440
The water ghosts turned from the spirits of water critters.

356
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,680
Why do they eat human?

357
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,320
I don't know what's under the lake.

358
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,680
The Biling Lake

359
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,800
had been calm and safe for many years.

360
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,240
But something happened.

361
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,480
There are some businessmen from outside two months ago.

362
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,960
Their ships sank.

363
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,720
At the beginning, no one takes it seriously.

364
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,760
But more ships sank,

365
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,800
and even the locals'.

366
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,160
It rarely happened before.

367
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,240
How about people in ships?

368
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,440
All of them were eaten.

369
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Did you see what ate them?

370
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, I didn't.

371
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,360
Then how can you be so sure?

372
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,880
It was done by the things in the lake.

373
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,880
The people certainly were eaten.

374
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
So many people had drown but no one has ever returned.

375
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,200
No one found even a dead body.

376
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,400
Bro Wangji,

377
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,560
do you think if the things in the lake

378
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,440
are water ghosts?

379
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,400
We can't judge before we see the whole picture.

380
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,120
But I think they are not.

381
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,560
Then,

382
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,800
if the things aren't water ghosts,

383
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,160
what are they?

384
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,280
How about this?

385
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,840
Let's make a bet.

386
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,120
I bet we think the same.

387
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,840
Boring.

388
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,960
Lan Zhan.

389
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,080
Lan Zhan!

390
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,120
So dull.

391
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,200
I heard that there was a fisherman died yesterday.

392
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,360
I'd like to see how much power

393
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,360
these little ghosts have.

394
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,600
Usually water ghosts just play tricks on people,

395
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,240
now they even dare to eat human.

396
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,240
Zewu Jun,

397
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,320
let alone the discussion of the villagers,

398
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
is there anyone who

399
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,840
has seen the things?

400
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,920
The ghosts are so crafty.

401
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,760
Once people are dragged into the water,

402
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,240
they barely come back.

403
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,640
No one has ever seen the true face.

404
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
Then, Zewu Jun,

405
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,080
how is cases of spirit snatching going?

406
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,040
Why do you ask about this?

407
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,960
The spiritual energy has been surging

408
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,160
in Cloud Recesses from the ancient times.

409
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,320
But now,

410
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,320
there's cultivators'soul being snatched

411
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,160
and here are water ghosts.

412
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,960
Do you think they are related?

413
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,720
We are looking into the spirit snatch thing.

414
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,760
But the water ghosts are in the water,

415
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,160
I don't think they are related.

416
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,600
- But... - Childe Wei,

417
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,680
now the most important thing is the exorcism.

418
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
Zewu Jun is right.

419
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
We can't waste time.

420
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,840
Lan Zhan,

421
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,680
do you want to drink?

422
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,960
Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan,

423
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,840
tell me,

424
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,040
is there any progress on the spirit snatch?

425
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,440
Not yet.

426
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,240
But I feel that

427
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,720
your brother is concealing something from us.

428
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
You think so, do you?

429
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,600
You also feel your brother is concealing.

430
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
And, I bet

431
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,560
it's not a trivial matter.

432
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
Or how can it be...

433
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,720
No liquor is allowed

434
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,800
during the night hunting.

435
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,640
Lan Zhan,

436
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Why don't I know the rule?

437
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,280
I've not taste a drop.

438
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,280
Give it back!

439
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Everyone, be careful,

440
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,360
it's near the haunted area.

441
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,960
Zewu Jun,

442
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,920
the ghosts are so cunning.

443
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,600
If they

444
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,120
keep hiding under the boat,

445
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,040
are we going to search forever?

446
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,040
What if we can't find them?

447
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,760
It's our duty.

448
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,120
Keep searching until we find them.

449
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,320
Lan Zhan, look at me!

450
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,440
Boring.

451
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,000
What's that?

452
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,640
I've never seen a water ghost like that.

453
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Don't tell me

454
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,520
that they are demonized by something?

455
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,880
Childe Wei,

456
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,320
how do you know they are under the boat?

457
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,200
Easy.

458
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,680
The draft is strange.

459
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,080
What's strange?

460
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,480
Just now his boat

461
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,080
has only one person on it,

462
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,160
but it drew deeper

463
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,960
than the boat carrying two people.

464
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,200
So there must be water ghosts under it.

465
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,080
You're an expertise.

466
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,560
Lan Zhan,

467
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,840
I didn't splash water on purpose.

468
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,520
It's because the water ghosts are so cunning,

469
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,720
if I say the truth,

470
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,200
they will run away.

471
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
Second Childe Lan,

472
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
you just pour my liquor out,

473
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,200
I didn't say a word.

474
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,200
Now, are we clear?

475
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,480
Stay away from me.

476
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,440
It's here!

477
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,640
Catch it!

478
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,280
Watch the right!

479
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,920
What's the name of this sword?

480
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,160
Whatever.

481
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
Whatever.

482
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,120
This sword has a spirit.

483
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,520
It's offensive to address it whatever I want.

484
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
I didn't ask you to call whatever you want.

485
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,480
Its name is Whatever.

486
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Look.

487
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,280
I know what you want to say.

488
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,880
You want to ask why do I pick this name,

489
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
if there is any special meaning.

490
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,560
Actually, there's nothing special.

491
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,520
When Uncle Jiang gave it to me,

492
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,680
he asked me how would I name it.

493
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,360
I had thought of more than twenty names,

494
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,960
but none of them are satisfying.

495
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
So I said, Whatever.

496
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,080
Now I think

497
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
Whatever is not bad.

498
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,920
Ridiculous.

499
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,240
I don't think so.

500
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,120
The fog is getting thicker.

501
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,720
Be careful.

502
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,720
Jiang Cheng, how are you?

503
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,200
Jiang Cheng, where are you?

504
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm fine.

505
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,000
Childe Jiang.

506
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Miss Wen.

507
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,120
You got hurt.

508
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,960
Miss Wen,

509
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm fine.

510
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,240
Jiang Cheng, how are you indeed?

511
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,120
I'm fine.

512
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
It's lucky that it just hurt skin.

513
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,040
It will recover after a few days.

514
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,560
The color of the water...

515
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Go back now!

516
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,320
The thing in the water

517
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,120
deliberately led us to the center of the lake.

518
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,080
Go now!

519
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,720
What happened?

520
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
Look, they come together.

521
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,120
The Aqua Demon!

522
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
It's the Aqua Demon!

523
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,200
The water ghosts came together

524
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,440
and became the Aqua Demon.

525
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,520
They wanna eat all of us!

526
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,680
Childe Wei, what should we do?

527
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,000
Ride the sword.

528
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,360
Ning!

529
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,480
Lan Zhan.

530
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,320
Lan Zhan, thanks for your help.

531
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,680
But why did you grab me by the collar?

532
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,960
Can you just hold me?

533
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,480
It makes me uncomfortable.

534
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,200
Well,

535
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,480
I give you my hand

536
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,400
you can just hold my hand.

537
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,160
I don't touch other people.

538
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,040
We are so intimate.

539
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,520
I'm not a stranger.

540
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,280
Not close at all.

541
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,200
You are so ridiculous.

542
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,520
You are so ridiculous.

543
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,440
When being grabbed by someone in the midair,

544
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,640
can you shut your mouth?

545
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,480
Shut up.

546
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,200
You...

547
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,840
Wei Wuxian.

548
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,400
What are you doing here?

549
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,320
I come to visit Wen Ning.

550
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,960
The door is open.

551
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,800
But what's going on with him,

552
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,440
why does he remain unconscious?

553
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,080
Childe Wei,

554
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,000
Ning needs rest.

555
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
Please leave if you have nothing else to say.

556
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,680
This is for you.

557
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,880
This is?

558
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,360
This is a talisman to protect him.

559
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,960
Protect him?

560
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,160
Though I am not a doctor like you,

561
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
as for magic arts,

562
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,440
I have my experience.

563
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,200
Wen Ning is a cultivator,

564
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,040
he's not so weak that he fainted just for the water.

565
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,840
Miss Wen, don't you feel strange?

566
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,520
Wei Wuxian.

567
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,080
What exactly do you want to say?

568
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,240
Did Wen Ning

569
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,040
have some unusual experience before?

570
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,480
Therefore,

571
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,800
he is so easy to be affected by the ghosts.

572
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,440
Miss Wen,

573
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,960
No matter what you want in Cloud Recesses,

574
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
I want you to keep this talisman.

575
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,080
And I wish this talisman protect him.

576
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,240
Of course you can choose not to believe me.

577
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,760
If you think this talisman fails to act,

578
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
just throw it away.

579
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,040
Comb.

580
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,840
Comb.

581
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,160
Comb.

582
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,440
Comb.

583
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,280
Boy, buy a comb for your girl.

584
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,720
I don't need it.

585
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,120
Boy, don't go.

586
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,560
Comb is an emblem of lovesickness.

587
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,720
It's the best gift for a girl.

588
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,240
Come to have a look.

589
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,720
Have a look.

590
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,720
Look.

591
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,520
Noodles, please.

592
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
Here you are.

593
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,440
Lotus capsule.

594
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,480
Lotus capsule.

595
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,080
The best lotus capsule.

596
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
The delicious lotus capsule.

597
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,400
Have a look.

598
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,280
Wangji,

599
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,000
what are you thinking about?

600
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
The Aqua Demon.

601
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,320
What Wei Wuxian had said,

602
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,760
is not unreasonable.

603
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,440
The cultivators'spirits were snatched

604
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,840
and the Aqua Demon appeared.

605
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,560
The connections between them,

606
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,040
do you have any clue?

607
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,760
Wangji,

608
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,760
I'm not so sure about these,

609
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
my only wish is that

610
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,440
my assumption is wrong.

611
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,200
But if it is not,

612
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,600
I'm afraid that we can't change it either.

613
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,360
Here you are.

614
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,400
Lan Zhan,

615
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,160
have some loquats.

616
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,480
No.

617
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,040
You're so boring.

618
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,240
Jiang Cheng, catch it.

619
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,800
You want loquats,

620
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,240
I can buy you a basket of it.

621
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,160
No.

622
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,880
The Emperor's Smile!

623
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,080
The Emperor's Smile from Gusu!

624
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,640
The Emperor's Smile of the first grade!

625
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,080
The Emperor's Smile!

626
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,320
The Emperor's Smile of the first grade!

627
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,120
The Emperor's Smile!

628
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,600
The Emperor's Smile of the first grade!
