00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 23

3
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,390
Why?

4
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,830
Why nothing happened?

5
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,270
Who is it?

6
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,390
Who?

7
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
It's you.

8
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,160
Clan Leader Wen.

9
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,670
Glad to meet you.

10
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Where did you get your shard of Yin Iron?

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,670
I've been "dead" once.

12
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,960
We of course came from the hell.

13
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,160
Clan Leader Wen.

14
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,550
My spiritual tool has just been refined.

15
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,320
No one has seen it yet.

16
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,800
What is it that can even control Yin Iron?

17
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,550
Did Xue Yang give it to you?

18
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,960
What on earth is that!

19
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,080
Clan Leader Wen.

20
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,910
This spiritual tool

21
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,000
is not called Yin Iron.

22
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,550
It is called

23
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,910
Stygian Tiger Amulet.

24
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,000
Stygian Tiger Amulet?

25
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,070
Wei Ying!

26
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,670
Wei Ying.

27
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,670
The Wens are all dead.

28
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,920
We won!

29
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:20,230
We won! We won! We won!

30
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,950
That sun

31
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,440
finally set down.

32
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,200
Brother Mingjue.

33
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,670
Xichen.

34
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,480
You're finally awake.

35
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,720
Hand me the blade.

36
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
Clan Leader Nie,

37
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
let me explain...

38
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,390
Brother Mingjue.

39
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,880
Clan Leader Nie,

40
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,510
you still got wounds on you.

41
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,600
Xichen.

42
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,070
It's none of your business.

43
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,510
When you were killing the cultivators of Nie clan...

44
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,040
I had no choice that moment.

45
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,230
You had no choice?

46
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
Whether or not to do it was up to you,

47
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,160
and so was whether or not to kill them!

48
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,670
Was it really up to me?

49
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,640
Clan Leader Nie,

50
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,600
if we could have exchanged our situation...

51
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,600
We couldn't!

52
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Brother Mingjue.

53
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,510
Xichen. Get out of the way!

54
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,320
Calm down!

55
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,230
Zewu Jun.

56
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,790
Brother Mingjue.

57
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,550
Brother Mingjue.

58
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,720
What are you doing this for?

59
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,830
What for?

60
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,760
Back then, after he was kicked out of Qinghe,

61
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,350
I was wondering why I couldn't know his whereabouts.

62
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,520
So he became the Wen's underling and

63
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,000
had been helping the tyrant at Nevernight!

64
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
Brother Mingjue.

65
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,910
Do you know who gave you the Wen clan's

66
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,840
map of tactical formation at that time?

67
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,150
Do you know who

68
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,470
was our source of info all the while?

69
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,280
There is no need to doubt.

70
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,150
Today, as well, I received Yao's message

71
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,470
so I could have made it to Scorching Sun Palace with Wangji.

72
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,150
I was right to have trusted him.

73
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,960
It was him who

74
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,880
schemed to let Wen Ruohan's guard down

75
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,000
and seized the opportunity to kill Wen Ruohan.

76
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,670
He...

77
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,320
Brother Mingjue.

78
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,080
After the incident at Qinghe,

79
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,960
Yao has always been feeling remorseful,

80
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
so he was afraid to run into you.

81
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,400
Then I was escaping from Cloud Recesses

82
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,710
and he saved my life.

83
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,840
Later on,

84
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,110
he managed to sneak into the Wen clan of Qishan,

85
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,590
approached Wen Ruohan,

86
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,875
and then wrote me letters in secrecy.

87
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,575
At first, I didn't know who

88
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:48,575
was sending the letters.

89
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,880
Then

90
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,200
I realized who it was after spotting

91
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,350
a few hints in his letters.

92
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,470
Didn't you tell Brother Mingjue all these?

93
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,550
Zewu Jun,

94
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
you saw it.

95
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,960
In that sort of situation,

96
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,280
even if I had said it,

97
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,790
Clan Leader Nie wouldn't have believed in me either.

98
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
Xian.

99
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,710
Xian, you're awake.

100
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,550
How do you feel?

101
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,030
Do you feel any discomfort?

102
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,470
Senior Sister.

103
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,030
What time is it now?

104
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,470
You've been asleep for three days.

105
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,000
Xian.

106
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
- For three days? - Come.

107
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,110
How about Jiang Cheng

108
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,350
and Lan Zhan?

109
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,590
Don't worry. They're all safe.

110
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,670
Xian.

111
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,670
Now Wen clan has been eliminated.

112
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,710
There's nothing to worry about.

113
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,710
The most important thing for you now is to have a good rest.

114
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,790
When you're in a coma these days,

115
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,400
both Cheng and Second Childe Lan were very worried about you.

116
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,350
Even Clan Leader Jin came to see you several times.

117
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,710
Jin Guangshan?

118
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,520
After Wen clan's elimination,

119
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,150
Clan Leader Jin rushed over from Lanling.

120
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,110
He said he would take troops to chase remaining evils of Wen clan.

121
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,550
I hadn't seen him in Sunshot Campaign.

122
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,670
Now he's so enthusiastic about it.

123
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,440
Xian.

124
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,550
Backbiting is not right.

125
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,910
Okay, senior sister.

126
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,520
Don't need to get up now.

127
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,880
Second Childe Lan said

128
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,440
you've spent too much spirit power by using the Amulet.

129
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,840
Even if you wake up, you have to rest for a few more days.

130
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,320
Senior Sister.

131
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,790
You've known it too?

132
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,350
I didn't know my Xian has been so good now.

133
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,670
But

134
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,670
you can't use the Amulet casually any more.

135
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,760
Second Childe Lan said that it could consume too much power

136
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,320
and is bad for your temperament.

137
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,710
Second Childe Lan. Second Childe Lan.

138
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,880
Why do you keep mentioning him today?

139
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,400
He's a boring person. He doesn't talk so much.

140
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,670
You're naughty again.

141
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,670
These days when you're in a coma,

142
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,960
Second Childe Lan came here every morning and evening,

143
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,280
playing his qin for you to relax your mind and spirit.

144
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,440
Otherwise, I'm afraid you wouldn't have woken up so soon.

145
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,760
It must be Second Childe Lan.

146
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,550
Lady Jiang.

147
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,760
Second Childe Lan.

148
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,440
Thank you. Second Childe Lan.

149
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,110
But for you, Xian wouldn't have woken up so soon.

150
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,000
You two can have a talk.

151
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,520
I'll go take care of the wounded.

152
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,640
Lan Zhan.

153
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,790
Actually I...

154
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,590
Quiet.

155
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,030
Concentrate.

156
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,150
Lan Zhan.

157
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,520
I'm fine!

158
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,670
Three days more needed.

159
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,910
I'm really fine!

160
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
Look.

161
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,070
Exorcise the evil. Ease the mind.

162
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,400
Don't be neglectful.

163
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,190
Exorcise the evil?

164
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,160
I don't need exorcism.

165
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,040
I've just spent too much spirit power.

166
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,800
Wei Ying.

167
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,310
Lan Zhan.

168
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,880
Do you also think that Stygian Tiger Amulet is evil

169
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
and can disturb people's mind?

170
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,110
But in the world,

171
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
is there really such an

172
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,640
undetectable thing

173
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,110
that can change people's mind

174
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,160
from loyalty to treachery

175
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,230
and from good to evil?

176
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,000
Kill them!

177
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,160
Don't kill me!

178
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,950
Kill them all!

179
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,040
They are catching people.

180
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,590
Don't let them go!

181
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,710
Chasing Wen's remaining evils.

182
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,830
Where are those three shards of Yin Iron?

183
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,520
Kill them all.

184
00:17:59,230 --> 00:17:59,640
Destroyed.

185
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
Don't let them run away.

186
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,760
Kill! You have nowhere to run!

187
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,800
Clan Leader Lan,

188
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,520
chasing remaining evils of Wen clan is a piece of cake.

189
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,710
You don't have to bother.

190
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,880
I will get it done properly by myself.

191
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,920
But I just heard a woman's voice.

192
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,560
Catching remaining evils of Wen clan

193
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,880
needn't include

194
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,640
the defenseless family members of Wen.

195
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
Xichen.

196
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,520
I know that you're a kind person.

197
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,190
But even if we have destroyed Wen clan,

198
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,070
there are numerous courtiers and myrmidons of Wen

199
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,310
all over the land.

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
Though you and I have conquered the Nevernight,

201
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,680
but what if they reunite

202
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,920
when we're off guard,

203
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,190
and fight for Wen clan

204
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,590
when we're busy settling down.

205
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,520
Lan clan has always preferred civilizing people.

206
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,470
What Xichen said is not unreasonable.

207
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,070
Clan Leader Jin.

208
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,560
How about letting go

209
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,520
these defenseless people of Wen?

210
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,520
Red Blade Master. Zewu Jun.

211
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
There is nothing wrong with considering benevolence first,

212
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,280
but don't forget about that

213
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,070
though Wen clan was eliminated

214
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,190
and three shards of Yin Iron were also destroyed,

215
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,560
there's still a shard of Yin Iron missing.

216
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,470
We cannot ignore it.

217
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,350
The great power of Yin Iron needn't to be further elaborated.

218
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,350
If,

219
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,950
I mean if,

220
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,640
it fell into the hands of Wen's remaining evils

221
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,590
or other people with ambition,

222
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,880
it will bring disaster.

223
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,190
Therefore,

224
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,680
to capture the Wen's remaining evils is to

225
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,160
find the whereabouts of Yin Iron.

226
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,830
Clan Leader Jin has thought about it very thoroughly.

227
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,710
Clan Leader Jin.

228
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,070
What do you mean by "people with ambition"?

229
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,000
Nothing.

230
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,110
Just this is of great importance.

231
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,680
We shouldn't let go of any suspicious person.

232
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,920
Therefore,

233
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,880
no matter the person is from Wen, Jin, or Jiang,

234
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,920
everyone has to be inquired one by one.

235
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,350
I've asked Yao

236
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,350
to have a detailed investigation on this.

237
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
To tell the truth,

238
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,280
Yao is my long-lost son.

239
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,350
Now it's very lucky for him

240
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,880
to have the chance

241
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,190
to find his origin.

242
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,710
How fortunate!

243
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,280
Now he's renamed Jin Guangyao.

244
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,640
Clan Leaders,

245
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,520
all Wen's remaining evils in Nevernight have been captured

246
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
= Jin Guangyao from Jin clan of Lanling =
all Wen's remaining evils in Nevernight have been captured

247
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,660
to await your justice.
= Jin Guangyao from Jin clan of Lanling =

248
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:24,920
= Jin Guangyao from Jin clan of Lanling =

249
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,880
Yao,

250
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,590
what's your opinion

251
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
about these remaining evils?

252
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
I've interrogated all the rest.

253
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,920
There is no clue about Yin Iron.

254
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,590
And most of they are family members of Wen

255
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,310
and have no spiritual power.

256
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,070
I suggest,

257
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,520
we confine and monitor these old, weak, and young,

258
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
as long as they stop making trouble.

259
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,470
And those who have killed our cultivators

260
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,520
must be executed.

261
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,350
But

262
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,950
where should we confine them?

263
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,230
There's a place of Wen clan

264
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,470
named Qiongqi Road.

265
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,710
It's a secluded ancient road

266
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,230
in a valley, which is

267
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,520
easy to defend and difficult to attack.

268
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,830
Why not keep them there?

269
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,350
You are really familiar with it.

270
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,950
Do as Yao just said.

271
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,070
Yao.

272
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,110
You don't have to take it seriously.

273
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,760
Brother Mingjue is typical of his kind.

274
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,110
He resents the evil and favors the good.

275
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,280
He's just afraid you've made wrong choice.

276
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,830
Resents the evil?

277
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,710
Am I the evil?

278
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,950
I, I didn't mean that.

279
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,070
Zewu Jun needn't put that on your mind.

280
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,560
I'd been following Clan Leader Nie for so many years.

281
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
I know what he's thinking.

282
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,760
I never take it personally.

283
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,000
Zewu Jun.

284
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,190
You can go with Clan Leader Nie first.

285
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,710
Here.

286
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,350
I'll handle it.

287
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,640
Okay.

288
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,520
Bring them in.

289
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,040
Lan Zhan.

290
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,920
How do you think of people here?

291
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,520
Who are good

292
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,680
and who are evil?

293
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,640
Wei Ying.

294
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,160
Concentrate.

295
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,920
Would you like to learn the musical notation of "Absterge"?

296
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,640
Lan Zhan.

297
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,830
You want me to learn "Absterge"?

298
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,400
You doubt me too, don't you?

299
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,400
Where did you get your shard of Yin Iron?

300
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,230
What is it that can even control Yin Iron?

301
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,950
Did Xue Yang give it to you?

302
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,520
What on earth is it!

303
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,800
When did you forge the Stygian Tiger Amulet?

304
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,680
Lan Zhan.

305
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,640
If I say that I got a Yin Iron sword

306
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,710
in the Slaughter Xuanwu Cave,

307
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,430
do you believe it?

308
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,350
When?

309
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,950
When the Xuanwu was slaughtered.

310
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,830
When did you finish refining it?

311
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
Recently...

312
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,800
You have already known it's Yin Iron.

313
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,470
Why refined it?

314
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,470
Lan Zhan. Enough!

315
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,800
You promised that

316
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
let me help you.

317
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,040
But if you don't believe me

318
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,590
how can I help you?

319
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,230
Stygian Tiger Amulet is not orthodox after all.

320
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,280
Once you get restless,

321
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,640
you will lose control.

322
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,520
Lan Zhan.

323
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,190
You fears that I'll be like Wen Ruohan

324
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,710
who was controlled by Yin Iron?

325
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,040
But Stygian Tiger Amulet is not Yin Iron.

326
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,680
Nor am I Wen Ruohan.

327
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,640
Help! Help!

328
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,190
Help! Please don't kill my child.

329
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,520
Don't kill us!

330
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,430
Don't kill me!

331
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,230
Help! Help!

332
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,310
Run!

333
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,800
Run!

334
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,590
Run!

335
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,640
It turned out to be Second Childe Lan.

336
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,760
I don't know why Second Childe Lan

337
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,230
wants to help these remaining evils of Wen clan?

338
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,190
These are women, children, and old man.

339
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,280
Are they also evil?

340
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,110
It's Clan Leader's order

341
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,230
that anyone who has concern with Yin Iron

342
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,920
should not be alive.

343
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,920
Clan Leader Nie and Clan Leader Lan also agreed.

344
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,920
Does Jiang clan have any questions?

345
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm afraid there will be more resentful spirits

346
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,680
in Qishan.

347
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,230
I'm afraid what is needed now

348
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,190
is the music "Requiescat".

349
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
We swear to God.

350
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,310
Today three of us will make a solemn pledge here.

351
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,070
Live up to our clans.

352
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,920
Help the common people.

353
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,920
Heaven and earth are here to bear witness.

354
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,110
If there is disloyalty between us,

355
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
we'll be universally condemned.

356
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,800
Both God and people will be furious with us.

357
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,470
If there is disloyalty between us,

358
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,230
we'll be universally condemned.

359
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,000
Both God and people will be furious with us.

360
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,110
Clan Leader Jin.

361
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,070
Congratulations. Clan Leader Yao.

362
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Now Wen clan has been eliminated.

363
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,710
I think we small clans

364
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,680
will rely on you.

365
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,110
You flatter me, Clan Leader Yao.

366
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,000
I have to thank you for your generous help.

367
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,430
Childe Jin.

368
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,470
No. I should call you Lianfang Zun.

369
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,430
You are so modest.

370
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,880
In the Sunshot campaign,

371
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,350
you have the greatest contribution.

372
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,350
Now,

373
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,760
you Lianfang Zun, Red Blade Master and Zewu Jun

374
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,400
all have respectable titles

375
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,920
which is also well-deserved.

376
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,680
You are flattering me.

377
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,310
Please.

378
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,160
After you. Please.

379
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,710
Clan Leader Jin.

380
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,400
Clan Leader Jiang is young and promising.

381
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,350
After Sunshot campaign.

382
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,680
you succeeded the clan leader.

383
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,280
Congratulations.

384
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,160
When will the succession ceremony be held?

385
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,350
Thanks, Clan Leader Jin.

386
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,430
I am still in mourning.

387
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,040
It's not appropriate to hold it.

388
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,070
Oh, right.

389
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,190
I am a close friend with Brother Fengmian.

390
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,560
After the departure in Gusu,

391
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,800
I never thought

392
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,230
it would be the departure between life and death.

393
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,710
Zewu Jun and Hanguang Jun have arrived.

394
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,760
Congratulations. Clan Leader Jiang.

395
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,600
I believe that in the leadership of Clan Leader Jiang,

396
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,710
Lotus Cove will surely revive

397
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,710
to protect the people of Yunmeng.

398
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,520
You flatter me.

399
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,470
In the future, I'd like to receive your guidance.

400
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,230
Red Blade Master has arrived.

401
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,630
Clan Leader Jin.

402
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,600
Clan Leader Nie.

403
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,150
Why are you so late?

404
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,670
All the gentry families are waiting for you.

405
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,430
Red Blade Master.

406
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,520
Please have a seat.

407
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,390
Yao.

408
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,000
You have forgotten it.

409
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,360
Now that you two are sworn brothers,

410
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,360
you should call him Big Bro.

411
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,560
Yeah.

412
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,630
Second Bro, thank you for your reminder.

413
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,390
Big bro.

414
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
Please.

415
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,630
Clan Leader Jin.

416
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,670
What do you mean?

417
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,560
Clan Leader Nie,

418
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,190
please have a seat so we can begin the banquet.

419
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,950
Clan Leader Jin.

420
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,800
Everybody.

421
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,280
Though we're holding a banquet at Nevernight,

422
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,630
I will never

423
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,080
sit in that seat.

424
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,080
Clan Leader Nie.

425
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,560
No wonder you're respected by many clans.

426
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,390
This should blame me. I'm too careless.

427
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,560
We'll rearrange our seats.

428
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,230
Clan Leader Nie, please.

429
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,040
Have a seat.

430
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,190
Please.

431
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,710
Childe Wei.

432
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,230
Childe Wei.

433
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,120
What did you want to say to me just now?

434
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,000
Me?

435
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,560
Yes.

436
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,800
Childe Wei seemed to have something to say to me

437
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,320
when we were greeting.

438
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,150
He is surely tactful and

439
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,430
can pay attention to all aspects.

440
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,430
Nothing.

441
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,630
It's just that the weapon you held

442
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,230
seemed to be a flexible saber

443
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,190
when you killed Wen Ruohan in the Sunshot Campaign.

444
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,040
Why doesn't Childe Jin carry it today?

445
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,230
Childe Wei. Sorry to have made a show.

446
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,470
It's just the first thing I could find.

447
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,430
Later, I found it was sinister.

448
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,150
Then I threw it away.

449
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,760
I see.

450
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,190
Please.

451
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,080
Please.

452
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,950
I here toast

453
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,650
to Clan Leader Jiang and Lady Jiang.

454
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,950
Thank you for saving my life last time.

455
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,950
Please.

456
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,560
It's you, Lan Zhan.

457
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,360
How about

458
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,360
playing "Absterge" ?

459
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,190
I'm learning a new score.

460
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,950
You haven't given up, have you?

461
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
You are really...

462
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,150
stubborn.

463
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,600
Good!

464
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:18,280
Clan Leader Jin is righteous!

465
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,800
Many clans gathered together

466
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,600
to crusade against Wen clan,

467
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,760
which is indeed a great fortune in the past hundred years.

468
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
The success of this campaign

469
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,630
owes thanks to Nie clan of Qinghe, Lan clan of Gusu

470
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,600
Jiang clan of Yunmeng, these three clans.

471
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,910
Today I'll drink first

472
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,870
to show my respect to you.

473
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,600
You're welcome, Clan Leader Jin.

474
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Very kind of you, Clan Leader Jin.

475
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,630
Oh, you shouldn't have.

476
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,430
Everybody.

477
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,040
Please sit down.

478
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,470
Everybody,

479
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,950
I have always been concerned about something.

480
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,910
It's inappropriate for me to mention it before

481
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,280
because of the campaign.

482
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,950
Now,

483
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,320
the disturbance has been suppressed

484
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
and I have no worries any more.

485
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,320
Luckily, all of you are here today,

486
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,600
so I hope everyone can be a witness.

487
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,760
As you all know,

488
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,800
I and Clan Leader Jiang Fengmian are as close as brothers.

489
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,040
And my wife and madam Yu are also as close as sisters.

490
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,080
My son, Zixuan,

491
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,710
has had engagement with Lady Jiang since childhood.

492
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,560
But just because of some misunderstandings, we called it off.

493
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,710
What a pity!

494
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Now my firend has joined the angels,

495
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,560
and I and my wife both hope that

496
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,360
the two families can become relatives by marriage again.

497
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,320
Not only it would comfort my old friend,

498
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,600
but also I can look after my friend's daughter.

499
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,390
which is one of my wishes.

500
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,630
Clan Leader Jiang,

501
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,670
what's your opinion?

502
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,800
Clan Leader Jiang.

503
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,430
That's a good thing.

504
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,670
Just say yes.

505
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,190
- Yeah, it's a good thing. - Good thing indeed.

506
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,190
- Yeah. - Just grant it, Clan Leader Jiang.

507
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,470
Sister seems still attached to that peacock.

508
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,080
But the engagement was already called off.

509
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,390
Granting it now

510
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,710
will make it look like that Jiang clan are playing up to others.

511
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,630
Clan Leader Jin,

512
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,800
we appreciate your kindness.
