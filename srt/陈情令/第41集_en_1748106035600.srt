00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000

The second one is the first one to be released.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

The fifth one is the first one to be released.

The fifth one is the first one to be released.

The fifth one is the first one to be released.

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is it.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the final one.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's her first release.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This one was released.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The fourth one was released.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
It is the second one.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
And...

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,480
ignore the call now.

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
What's her name?

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
Master, it's Meng Xiaoyao.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,240
Die?

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
As the father left,

41
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,500
you knew how to lead his team

42
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,680
and let your誘壮 lord

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
go back and tell everyone

44
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm leaving

45
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,780
I see

46
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,500
Yes.

47
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,460
Chief Nie.

48
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,740
Meng Yao.

49
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,460
Yes.

50
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,460
Why do you take a break from the cave

51
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,780
like others?

52
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,620
Chief...

53
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,960
Come with me.

54
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,260
ِ

55
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
It's really Jiang Meng Yao.

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
Yeah.

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
It's her.

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,200
No, it's Xia pray to god.

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,900
Xia pray to god.

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,460
Yes.

61
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,980
What the hell sucks?

62
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,320
So ituria about not having any school for me

63
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,360
Come again?

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
can be with us as one.

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
That's right.

66
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
We can find him.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
If we do something,

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
we can make him stop working hard.

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,800
No, no, no.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,200
He's using his heart

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,360
to find the Blue Spirit

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
from Yunmeng.

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
He just wants to recognize this father.

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,000
What's the result?

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
The result is

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
that he was kicked out

77
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,920
from the stage by someone.

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm not saying

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
that Jin Guangshan

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
has been born so many times.

81
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
At least he has a son and a daughter.

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
Have you recognized him?

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,320
So,

84
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,960
he's the one who made this up.

85
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,640
He's the one who made this up.

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,800
He's the one who made this up.

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,680
He can't just judge

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,000
what he shouldn't judge.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,840
In the end,

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,880
he's the one who's got a bloody head.

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Who's the blame?

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,520
No one can blame him.

93
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,240
He's the one who made this up.

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
Yes.

95
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
That's right.

96
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Is he stupid?

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,080
There's a Jin Zixuan.

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,720
What else does Jin Guangshan

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,200
like to have?

100
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
Moreover,

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,560
he's a long-time student

102
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,840
who's been bullied by thousands of people.

103
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,000
I wonder who he is.

104
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,480
I think

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Jin Guangshan

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,600
is also a psychologicalist.

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
He's not afraid of that, right?

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
Of course.

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
I think he

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
has never

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,400
made such a mess with that woman.

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm glad

113
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,520
that he can recognize Jin Guangshan

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,040
and give us water.

115
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,080
What do you mean?

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,200
He's a good man.

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,000
He's not that good at it.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,240
He's always running around

119
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,920
and doing this.

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,240
He's so good-looking.

121
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
He's always looking for

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,840
a good name.

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
His father will recognize him.

124
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
Master.

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,280
Master.

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,960
I do

127
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,800
府 Saint's

128
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
present

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
so terribly

130
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,840
acquainted with you

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
even without my Brooks in the mouth.

132
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,040
You won't forgive me

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
unless you actually

134
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
do harm to the people.

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Meng Yao.

137
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Song Chu.

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
A man with a big family,

139
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
with a position,

140
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
with a political position.

141
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
These people

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
are behind you,

143
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
and they are making a big fuss.

144
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The more you want to do it,

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
the more these people

146
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
have nothing to say.

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
From now on,

148
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
you are my father.

149
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Meng Yao.

150
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Thank you, Sect Leader Nie.

151
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Meng Yao.

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Meng Yao.

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
It's not me.

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
It's not me.

155
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
It's really not me.

156
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
It's really not me.

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,800
It's really not me.

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Sect Leader Nie.

159
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Please wait.

160
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Please listen to me explain.

161
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
What do you want to explain?

162
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Just now,

163
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I saw him

164
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
leaving Xue Ya because of food.

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I immediately asked him for a reason.

166
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Who knows?

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Who knows that he actually wanted to kill me?

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
He even said that my mother was my mother.

169
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
I killed him.

170
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
You are lying.

171
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
If it's really a person,

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
you are already angry.

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
How could you

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
be the one

175
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
who made that expression?

176
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
How could you use the sword of the Wen clan?

177
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
How could you

178
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
pretend to be Xue Ya?

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
You are clearly a new strategy.

180
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
You are a bloody demon.

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Sect Leader Nie told me a few days ago.

182
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
That day,

183
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I was curious to see

184
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
who you were talking to.

185
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Who did you talk to?

186
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
What?

187
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I didn't.

188
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Then what were you doing?

189
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I was doing what he told me to.

190
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I was just helping out the criminal,

191
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Xue Ya.

192
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
You liar.

193
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I just saw it clearly.

194
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Your talk...

195
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
You told me many times.

196
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
What do you know?

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Brother Zonglin, you misunderstood.

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Brother Zonglin is drunk.

199
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Send him back.

200
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
You are so jealous.

201
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Huaisang, go to the dungeon to see where he is.

202
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Meng Yao, Meng Yao, I ask you.

203
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,800
When you first met me, you intentionally pretend to be the weak spirit of the beast.

204
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I will help you.

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
If I didn't kill you that day,

206
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,800
you would kill them all like today.

207
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
I don't want to lie in front of me.

208
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I can't live without the wind.

209
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Meng Yao, you have no regrets.

210
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Today, you saved my life.

211
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I don't know you.

212
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Go.

213
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I don't care where you are going today.

214
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Anyway, never come back.

215
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I see the immortal.

216
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Chief Nie, you are here.

217
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
It's you.

218
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
It's you.

219
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I really didn't expect that.

220
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
You will have a wolf's back today.

221
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Get out of here.

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
You still think you are the king of the river?

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Look carefully.

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
This is Yan Yang Hall.

225
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
What Yan Yang Hall?

226
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
It's just a school in Wen City.

227
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Damn it.

228
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
If you can kill me, I will kill you too.

229
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Good.

230
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Anyone else want to say that word?

231
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Go.

232
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Chief Nie, why don't you take a look at what it is?

233
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Chief Nie, I have been doing a lot of things.

234
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
You are angry now.

235
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Aren't you too late?

236
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Take your hand away.

237
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Your sword is a good weapon.

238
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
But, compared to the sword of your father,

239
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,800
it's a little bit worse than the sword of your father.

240
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Why don't you guess that

241
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Chief Wen will be dead when he takes a few shots?

242
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I remember when that sword was sent back,

243
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Chief Nie died.

244
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
I remember that.

245
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I remember that.

246
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I remember that.

247
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Brother Nie.

248
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Xichen.

249
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
You are finally awake.

250
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Give me the knife.

251
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Chief Nie.

252
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Brother Mingjue.

253
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Chief Nie, you still have wounds on your body.

254
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Xichen, don't worry.

255
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
When you killed my Xiong Shi just now,

256
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I didn't do anything to make it worse.

257
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I didn't do anything to make it worse.

258
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I didn't do anything to make it worse.

259
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I didn't do anything to make it worse.

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Whether you kill me or not, I will kill you.

261
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Are you really in my favor?

262
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Chief Nie, if we were to be together,

263
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
we wouldn't...

264
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Brother Mingjue.

265
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Xichen, let go of me.

266
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Go away.

267
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Brother Mingjue.

268
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
When he left Qinghe,

269
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I lost his message.

270
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
So he was a dog walking around in the night city.

271
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Brother Mingjue.

272
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Do you know who is the person

273
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
who killed Qi Shanwen before this?

274
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Do you know who is the person

275
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
who reported Yuan Tong to us?

276
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
He...

277
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Chief Nie.

278
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
In the Yanyang Hall,

279
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
I was trying to trick Wen Ruohan's trust

280
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
to make him find out about you.

281
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
But I hurt you and I didn't believe you.

282
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I knew you were hurt by your heart.

283
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
You even wanted to hurt you.

284
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You shouldn't be me.

285
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
You are the murderer you killed.

286
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I am in a bad mood.

287
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I am in a bad mood.

288
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Wen Ruohan is in a bad mood.

289
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
He is a little bit tired.

290
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
He is going crazy.

291
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I am going to disguise him as his family.

292
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I can't do anything to insult him.

293
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Very good.

294
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,800
It seems that you usually don't do these things.

295
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Brother Mingjue.

296
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
A'Yao is in Qi Shan.

297
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
He is not in a hurry to do some things.

298
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I believe that when he does these things,

299
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
he will be...

300
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I am in a bad mood.

301
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
As you wish.

302
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,360
and may Heaven《IПрime》一个天人、宫梨我们願意给怪物

303
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,160
欠福索志

304
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
还有的人共怒

305
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

306
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

307
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

308
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

309
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

310
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

311
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

312
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

313
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

314
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

315
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

316
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

317
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

318
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

319
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

320
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

321
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

322
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

323
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

324
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

325
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

326
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

327
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

328
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

329
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

330
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

331
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,800
din

332
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,360
I'll just smash this one.

333
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,320
Ayao's love is also very good

334
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,440
in addition to Gusu.

335
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,960
If you can get the point of the master,

336
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,640
I'll definitely owe you one day.

337
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,040
Master is right in front of me.

338
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,400
I dare not object.

339
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,680
What do you want to teach me?

340
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,520
How about the crystal?

341
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,120
Okay.

342
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll teach you.

343
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,520
I'll teach you.

344
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520

345
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
I'll teach you.

346
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520

I'll teach you.

355
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
I'll teach you.

356
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I'll teach you.

357
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
I'll teach you.

358
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
I'll teach you.

359
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520

I'll teach you.

365
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
I'll teach you.

366
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
I'll teach you.

367
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
I'll teach you.

368
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
I'll teach you.

369
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll teach you.

370
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I'll teach you.

371
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
I'll teach you.

372
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
I'll teach you.

373
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I'll teach you.

374
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I'll teach you.

375
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I'll teach you.

376
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
I'll teach you.

377
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
I'll teach you.

378
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I'll teach you.

379
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I'll teach you.

380
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I'll teach you.

381
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I'll teach you.

382
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
I'll teach you.

383
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
I'll teach you.

384
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I'll teach you.

385
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
I'll teach you.

386
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I'll teach you.

387
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
I'll teach you.

388
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
I'll teach you.

389
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I'll teach you.

390
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
I'll teach you.

391
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I'll teach you.

392
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
I'll teach you.

393
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
I'll teach you.

394
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I'll teach you.

395
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I'll teach you.

396
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I'll teach you.

397
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll teach you.

398
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
I'll teach you.

399
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
I'll teach you.

400
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
I'll teach you.

401
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,600
May you die.

402
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,480
No.

403
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,400
Don't make him angry again.

404
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
He's been suffering from the deep pain lately.

405
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
If you don't give him a clear voice every day,

406
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm afraid he...

407
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
King of Jin!

408
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,080
Big Brother, what's wrong?

409
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Don't move.

410
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Come out!

411
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Big Brother,

412
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Big Brother,

420
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
please help me

421
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,040
to cover up the name of the Gui Bin.

422
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
I'll go and talk to Big Brother.

423
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll ask you to talk to him later.

424
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Big Brother,

425
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
why do you have to say that?

426
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Where's Xue Yang?

427
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,680
He's been locked up in the dungeon.

428
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
He's still alive.

429
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,520
How did I tell you

430
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
that I was in the Gui Bin?

431
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm sorry.

432
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm sorry.

434
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm sorry.

435
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm sorry.

436
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm sorry.

441
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm sorry.

443
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm sorry.

444
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
I told you that

445
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
I wanted Xue Zhai to be the emperor.

446
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
But you didn't give him a life.

447
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
As long as he was punished,

448
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
he couldn't be punished.

449
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
He didn't give a life

450
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
and Xue Zhai was the emperor.

451
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
He was not...

452
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Let me ask you.

453
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Who let Xue Yang go

454
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
in the time he was in the Gui Bin?

455
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Was it my commander

456
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
or you?

457
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I didn't.

458
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Why did I let him go?

459
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
But it was at that time.

460
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Chang Ping has been locked up.

461
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
He didn't have any evidence.

462
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Xue Yang killed 50 people in Chang's time.

463
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
But my father

464
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
must stay.

465
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Why?

466
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
He has a silver chain.

467
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Don't you know?

468
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
You brought him back.

469
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
What did you do?

470
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
You know it all.

471
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Brother.

472
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
It's my father's order.

473
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I can't refuse.

474
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
You want me to punish Xue Yang.

475
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
How should I explain it to him?

476
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Meng Yao.

477
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
You are a fool.

478
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
You have been

479
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
useless in my place.

480
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I...

481
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
I...

482
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Brother.

483
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
You always scold me

484
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
for not being able to keep my mind.

485
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
You said you were good at fighting.

486
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
You are not afraid of heaven or earth.

487
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
You don't need to

488
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
make any trouble for men and husbands.

489
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Fine.

490
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
You are a noble man.

491
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
You are also a good man.

492
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
But what about me?

493
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Am I as good as you?

494
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
I have no good manners.

495
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
I am so old.

496
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Who taught me?

497
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
But I have no background.

498
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Do you think I am

499
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
very stable in Lanling?

500
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Do you think I will be

501
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
the best if I die?

502
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Jin Guangshan.

503
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
He can never

504
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
bring me back to life.

505
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
He didn't mean

506
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
to make me die.

507
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I am afraid of heaven and earth.

508
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
I am afraid of heaven and earth.

509
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,520
I am afraid of people.

510
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
You are not going to kill Xue Yang

511
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
if you don't kill him.

512
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
You just don't want to

513
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
take the throne of Jin clan in Lanling.

514
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Of course I don't want to.

515
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
But brother.

516
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
I always want to ask you a question.

517
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
The lives you have

518
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
are more than me.

519
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
They are less than me.

520
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
Why did I

521
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
just kill a few people

522
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
in the form of a ghost?

523
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
How could you

524
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
turn the tide like this?

525
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
How could you turn the tide like this?

526
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
I...

527
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
I am telling you.

528
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I have many souls.

529
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
But I will never

530
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
kill people for the sake of

531
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
the dead.

532
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
I will never kill people

533
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
for the sake of the dead.

534
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Brother.

535
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
I understand what you mean.

536
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Do you want to say

537
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
that all the people you killed

538
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
are the most important people?

539
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Then how can I

540
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
judge

541
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
if you are the most important person?

542
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Your standards

543
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
must be fair.

544
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I will kill one person

545
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
and I will kill a hundred people.

546
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
It is a fair and generous thing.

547
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
But the most important thing is the most important.

548
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
The great thing in the jade city

549
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
will always be sacrificed.

550
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Why don't you sacrifice yourself?

551
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Are you more expensive than them?

552
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Are you different from them?

553
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Yes.

554
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Of course, I am different from them.

555
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Bastard!

556
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
You are so stupid.

557
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
You are so stupid!

558
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Brother.

559
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Brother.

560
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I should have told you the truth.

561
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Brother.

562
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Since you handed me the jade seal,

563
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I have given you the jade seal every time.

564
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Now,

565
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
you are so stupid.

566
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Brother.

567
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
You are so stupid.

568
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
You are so stupid.

569
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
You are so stupid.

570
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
You are so stupid.

571
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
What are you saying?

572
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,520
I am the one who always give you a clear mind.

573
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I have never bothered you.

574
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Brother, don't blame me for telling you.

575
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,520
You are so careless.

576
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
You didn't find out

577
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:45,520
what's the difference between my clear mind and my brother?

578
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Uncle Gan'er!

579
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
I will kill you!

580
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Kill! Kill!

581
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I am going to kill you!

582
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Kill!

583
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,520
I am going to kill you!

584
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Kill!

585
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,720
Kill!

586
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,520
I am going to kill you!

587
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Kill!

588
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Rairs!

589
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,320
Brother...

590
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Brother!

591
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
Brother!

592
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
Kill!

593
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Brother!

594
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
Hurry!

595
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
Don't go over there!

596
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Brother is not coming anymore!

597
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Brother!

598
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
Brother!

599
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Brother!

600
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Brother!

601
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
It's me!

602
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Brother!

603
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Brother!

604
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Brother!

605
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Brother!

606
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Brother!

607
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
No!

608
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I only have half of the power of the Tiger's Manor.

609
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I can't control it.

610
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
What should I do?

611
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Brother!

612
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Kill him!

613
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
The Tiger's Manor

614
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
This is finally my turn.

615
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
The Tiger's Manor

616
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
The Tiger's Manor

617
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Brother!

618
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Hey!

619
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Wake up!

620
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Move!

621
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Move!

622
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Wei Ying!

623
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Wake up!

624
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Wei Ying!

625
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
The Tiger's Manor

626
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,320
The Tiger's Manor

627
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
How is it?

628
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Let's go.

629
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Where are we going?

630
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
The Imperial Palace.

631
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,320
The Tongjing Palace is the entrance to the secret room.

632
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,320
Her wife just broke into her secret.

633
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
She was taken in.

634
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
Now she is in there.

635
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
The head of the wingman is also in there.

636
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Let's hurry up.

637
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Wait!

638
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
The Han Army is so smart.

639
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
But there is an important matter.

640
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Please let the disciples go first.

641
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
And report to the capital.

642
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Move!

643
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Move!

644
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
You can't be in a hurry.

645
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Let you go.

646
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Let it go.

647
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Wang Ji!

648
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Brother!

649
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
Where are you?

650
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
The Imperial Palace.

651
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
It's you?

652
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
What are you doing here?

653
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
Wait!

654
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
This is my uncle's secret room.

655
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Did you go to the wrong place?

656
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Stop!

657
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
You are so stubborn.

658
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
What are you doing?

659
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Master Lian Fang!

660
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Master Jin!

661
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Open the door!

662
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Open the door!

663
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
What are you doing?

664
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
You are the one who came here.

665
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
This is my uncle's secret room.

666
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Do you understand?

667
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
I told you not to do anything wrong.

668
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
But the day is not enough.

669
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Do you want to open another night here?

670
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Master Lian Fang!

671
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Thank god you came in time.

672
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
And come here later.

673
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,320
You can't see anything good in the secret room of the Imperial Palace.

674
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Secret room?

675
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
What's wrong?

676
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
The secret room is not a secret room, right?

677
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
As long as there are some treasure under the box,

678
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
there are not many treasure rooms in the family.

679
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Ayou, can you open the treasure room

680
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
and let us have a look?

681
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Brother,

682
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
since it's called the treasure room,

683
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,320
the things inside are hidden.

684
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Suddenly, I was opened.

685
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,320
And this is opened.

686
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Master Lan!

687
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
The most important thing is the transmission of the Lan clan.

688
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,320
It seems that the transmission is just a rumor.

689
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,320
The power of the family is really important.

690
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Su She.

691
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
Lord Han Guang.

692
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Su She,

693
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
you were a traitor to Lan clan,

694
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,320
but you still have a lot of power in Lord Han Guang.

695
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
You have a lot of power in him.

696
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,320
What's your position to say that you are a traitor to Lan clan?

697
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
I'm a traitor to Lan clan.

698
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
I'm a traitor to the Lan clan.

699

717
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I'm a traitor to the Lan clan.
