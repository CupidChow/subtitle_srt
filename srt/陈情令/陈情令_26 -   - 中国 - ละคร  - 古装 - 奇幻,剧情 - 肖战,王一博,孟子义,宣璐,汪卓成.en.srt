00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 26

3
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,800
= Jinlintai =

4
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,470
Are you permitted to walk on this road?

5
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,720
Who allowed you to wander freely?

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,550
Forgive me.

7
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,470
I...

8
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,110
Su She.

9
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,110
The ways on Jinlintai are extremely complicated.

10
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,800
We can't blame Childe Su for going in wrong road.

11
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,520
How can you come up everywhere?

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,880
Second brother. Hanguang Jun.

13
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,240
Please.

14
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,190
Please come with me.

15
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,750
You remember me?

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,630
Of course.

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,750
How could I not?

18
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,800
Haven't we met once before?

19
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,390
Su Minshan, Childe Su.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Your swordsmanship is very good.

21
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,480
Last time during the banquet in Nevernight,

22
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,830
= Su She, courtesy name is Minshan =
Last time during the banquet in Nevernight,

23
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:04,880
= Su She, courtesy name is Minshan =

24
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,110
I was thinking

25
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,190
it was a pity that such a talented young man

26
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,910
didn't visit my home.

27
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,190
Today you really paid us a visit.

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,630
I am over the moon.

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
Please go this way.

30
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,520
- Brother. - this way please.

31
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,830
Please.

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,110
Clan Leader Su,

33
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,470
sit down please.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,520
Second Bro.

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,030
Yao.

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Is Su She invited by you?

37
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,830
Yes.

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
After the Sunshot Campaign,

39
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,670
every gentry family rebuilt their mansion house.

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,160
Clan Leader Su has also got back to his hometown Moling

41
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,270
to build his sect.

42
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,630
It took only a few months for the sect to take shape.

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,360
It's good for everyone to make friends with such a talent.

44
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,270
Yao,

45
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,750
don't you know Su She...

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
Childe, you didn't know that

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
Clan Leader Su

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,880
was a peripheral disciple of Lan clan at first.

49
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,630
He established himself in Moling after Sunshot Campaign.

50
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,600
Second Bro,

51
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,320
I didn't know that.

52
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,510
Only just now...

53
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,200
It doesn't matter.

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,070
The uninformed is not guilty.

55
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,550
Never mind.

56
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,950
Two Childes, let me fill cups for you.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,110
Bro Jiang. Bro Jiang.

58
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,230
Sit here. Sit here.

59
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,790
Have a drink, bro Jiang.

60
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,640
Sure.

61
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,550
Gentry friends,

62
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,880
this Phoenix Mountain Crowd Hunt is unprecedentedly grand.

63
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,350
Quantities of caught preys are the most in history.

64
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,070
Especially Jiang clan of Yunmeng

65
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,440
caught the most preys among all clans.

66
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,950
Congratulations, Childe Jiang.

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,670
What a delectable and glorious deed!

68
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,270
Jiang clan of Yunmeng dare not claim all credits.

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,950
I am willing to contribute all we caught

70
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,790
to all gentry families to support gentry friends.

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,390
and thank for the enthusiastic invitation of Jin clan.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,790
Sure enough, Clan Leader Jiang is sensible.

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,550
Right.

74
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,720
Clan Leader Jiang is indeed a teenager hero

75
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,320
and has your father's demeanor.

76
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Please have a drink.

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,320
Clan Leader Lan. Hanguang Jun.

78
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880
Let toast to you two.

79
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,640
Zixun.

80
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,760
Zewu Jun and Hanguang Jun

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,720
all come from Cloud Recesses.

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,640
Three thousand disciplines are curved on Discipline Stone.

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,320
Instead of drinking liquor, you might as well...

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,000
We Jin clan and Lan clan

85
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,830
are close friends.

86
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,040
If you don't drink,

87
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,160
that means you look down on me.

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,480
What an frank and forthright air!

89
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,670
It is what the gentry should be made of.

90
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,320
Let's save the words.

91
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,230
Clan Leader Lan,

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,790
we are not strangers.

93
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't cope with me

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,230
with the method for strangers.

95
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,110
One simple question.

96
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,830
Drink or not?

97
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,270
They are to maneuver the sword to come back.

98
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,000
Drinking will affect that negatively.

99
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,600
Drinking two cups of liquor doesn't hurt.

100
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
Even if I drink eight jorums of liquor,

101
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,720
I still can maneuver the sword and fly in the sky.

102
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,790
Good.

103
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,390
Hanguang Jun.

104
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,480
It's your turn.

105
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,350
Please.

106
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,600
I drink for him.

107
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,760
Is that OK?

108
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,070
Childe Wei.

109
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,350
When did you come?

110
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,000
Just now.

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Childe Wei, why do you come so late?

112
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,640
Here. Here. Here. Sit down please.

113
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,550
Don't bother,

114
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,520
I have something emergent to ask Childe Jin.

115
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,200
Can I have a moment with you?

116
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,000
You can talk to me

117
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,080
until our family feast is

118
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,320
over.

119
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
How long?

120
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,080
In six to eight hours.

121
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,440
Or eight to ten hours maybe.

122
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,710
Or maybe tomorrow.

123
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm afraid I can't wait that long.

124
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,670
It's not up to you.

125
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Wei Wuxian.

126
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,760
Childe Wei, what do you need from Childe Jin?

127
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,350
Is that urgent?

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,350
Extremely urgent.

129
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
No time to delay.

130
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,280
Here. Here. Here.

131
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,470
Clan Leader Lan.

132
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,110
Let's drink again.

133
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,910
OK.

134
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
I'll just say it right here.

135
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,670
Childe Jin, please tell me

136
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,960
do you know a persen called Wen Ning?

137
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,280
No.

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,640
You definitely know a person called Wen Ning.

139
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,840
A month ago, you was night hunting in Ganquan

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,080
and chasing a eight-wings bat king

141
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,350
to a habitation of remnant Wen clan,

142
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,080
or so-called detention place

143
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,670
and took a group of Wen clan's disciples away.

144
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,880
The leader of them is Wen Ning.

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,150
I said I don't know him.

146
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,000
I am too busy to

147
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,200
remember a Wen bastard's name.

148
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,640
Fine.

149
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,710
I don't mind explaining it further to you.

150
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,440
You couldn't catch up with the bat king,

151
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,760
and ran into Wen clan's disciples who came to

152
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,910
see what happened.

153
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,320
So you forced them to put on Spirit Lure Flags

154
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,670
as living baits.

155
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,910
They were afraid to do it.

156
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,200
One of them stood up and argued with you stutteringly.

157
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,760
This person was Wen Ning.

158
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,840
During the tarriance,

159
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
bat king ran away.

160
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,440
So you beat disciples of Wen Clan hard

161
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,710
and took them away.

162
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,440
They disappeared since then.

163
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,280
Do you want me to say more details?

164
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,150
They haven't returned so far.

165
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,400
Except you,

166
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,590
I really don't know who else I can ask.

167
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,640
Wei Wuxian,

168
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,150
what do you mean?

169
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,790
You ask me to hand them over?

170
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,200
Do you want to

171
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,470
stand up for those bastards?

172
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,230
It doesn't concern you whether I wanna speak for them or step on them.

173
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,840
Just hand them over.

174
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,840
Wei Wuxian, don't be so rampant.

175
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,320
How dare you be so rude as you stand here?

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
Do you really think you are invincible

177
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
so that no one dare to offend you?

178
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,670
Do you want to overturn the heaven?

179
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,200
Are you comparing yourself with the heaven?

180
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,080
With all due reapect,

181
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,520
you really have a thick skin.

182
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,280
It wasn't a big deal.

183
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,520
You teenagers get angry so easily.

184
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,790
But Childe Wei,

185
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,440
fairly speaking,

186
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,550
today you intrude the private banquet of us Jin clan of Lanling.

187
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,670
Isn't it improper?

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,710
Clan Leader Jin,

189
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,710
I didn't want to mess with private banquet.

190
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,910
My apology.

191
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
However, lives of people

192
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,960
taken by Childe Jin is uncertain so far.

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,960
It's hard to save them with one step later.

194
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,230
I am grateful to one of them, who saved my life.

195
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,880
I have no reason to stand by.

196
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,350
Please forgive me.

197
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,710
I'll repay you in the future.

198
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,880
Why can't you delay it?

199
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,470
Come and sit.

200
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,110
I'll talk with you slowly.

201
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,840
Wei Wuxian, what on earth do you want to do?

202
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,520
It's kind of you, Clan Leader Jin.

203
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,550
I won't sit.

204
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,790
This can't wait.

205
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,320
Please solve it soon.

206
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,400
You are anxious. I'm more anxious.

207
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,230
Clam down.

208
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,710
Talking about this,

209
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,590
we still have some problems yet to be solved.

210
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,670
Since you are here,

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,520
let's take the chance

212
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,910
to tackle them all together.

213
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
Tackle what?

214
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,280
Childe Wei,

215
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,760
I mentioned it to you

216
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
a few times before.

217
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,670
Don't you remember?

218
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,840
In Sunshot Campaign,

219
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,150
you used one thing.

220
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,150
Stygian Tiger Amulet?

221
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,150
Is there a problem?

222
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,470
It is extremely similar with Yin Iron.

223
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,520
You used it on the battlefield.

224
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
It's very powerful.

225
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,880
Besides,

226
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,590
it hurt a lot of cultivators accidentally.

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,470
Please get to the point.

228
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,790
This is the point.

229
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,590
Four shards of Yin Irons. Three were destroyed

230
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,710
One is missing.

231
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,550
Regardless of how your Stygian Tiger Amulet was forged,

232
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,080
its power is too strong for anyone to master.

233
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,910
Such an important thing

234
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,280
is held in your hand alone. I'm afraid...

235
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,790
Clan Leader Jin,

236
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,110
are you hinting something?

237
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,400
Good.

238
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,400
Please allow me to ask another question.

239
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,350
Does Clan Leader Jin think

240
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,400
without Wen clan of Qishan,

241
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,550
Jin clan

242
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,200
is supposed to take its place naturally?

243
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,110
So everything should be handed over to you

244
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,880
and everyone should follow your order.

245
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,030
Look at the acting style of Jin clan of Lanling.

246
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,320
I almost thought it's heyday of Wen clan again.

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,670
Wei Wuxian, what are you talking about?

248
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,760
Did I say wrong?

249
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,520
At Nevernight

250
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,880
I could take what you did as revenge.

251
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,590
But now that's water under the bridge,

252
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,230
you still force people to be the living baits.

253
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,760
If they refuse, you beat and bully them.

254
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,320
What's the difference between you and Wen clan of Qishan?

255
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,320
Wei Ying.

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,910
Of course it's different.

257
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,110
Wen clan people do evil things.

258
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,550
This is what they deserve.

259
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,790
It's just a tooth for a tooth.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,080
Let them eat their own bitter fruits.

261
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,230
What did we do wrong?

262
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,550
You should punish the people who bit you.

263
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,350
Wen Qing and Wen Ning have never got their hands

264
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,320
on anything bloody.

265
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,350
Or

266
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,960
you want to execute the collective punishment?

267
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,440
It's righteous for anyone to kill Wen clan people.

268
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Why the hell should we talk sense into them?

269
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,760
It's a pity that I killed

270
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,150
too few of them.

271
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,030
You even kill the innocent casually.

272
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,440
Then if I kill you today,

273
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,640
is that justified?

274
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,470
You...

275
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,790
- Wei Wuxian. - Wei Ying.

276
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,350
Childe Wei,

277
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,910
don't be hotheaded.

278
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,150
Everything can be discussed.

279
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,590
Wei Wuxian,

280
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,640
Clan Leader Jiang is still here.

281
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,710
Aren't you being too unscrupulous?

282
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
If I, Wei Wuxian, want to kill someone,

283
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,470
who can stop me?

284
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,350
Who dare to stop me?

285
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,710
Wei Ying,

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,880
put down Chenqing.

287
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,960
Jin Zixun!

288
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,230
Presumably everyone knows

289
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,840
that I am not patient.

290
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,230
I have

291
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,590
wasted so much time with you here.

292
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,400
I only count to three.

293
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,840
Three.

294
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,400
Two.

295
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,110
Forget it. Forget it.

296
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,760
Isn't it just for a few cultivators of Wen clan?

297
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,960
If you want them, go ahead.

298
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,110
I don't want to badger with you any more.

299
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Go to Qiongqi Road and find them yourself.

300
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,400
Look at you.

301
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,760
Why don't you say it earlier?

302
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,470
I found them.

303
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,830
Let's go.

304
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,800
You might as well have a rest first.

305
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,070
I go alone.

306
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,520
I promise you

307
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,520
I shall save him.

308
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,710
No.

309
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,830
No.

310
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,310
I have to go.

311
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,070
I have to go.

312
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,520
How can you go being like this condition?

313
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,520
Eat something

314
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,070
and replenish your strength.

315
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,680
I promise you

316
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,520
if you eat this up,

317
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,470
I will take you there.

318
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,280
Where are Ning and others?

319
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,160
Qiongqi Road.

320
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,520
I knew it.

321
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,310
I should never have left him.

322
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,470
But I can't help it.

323
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,830
They transferred me to another city.

324
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,400
When I came back,

325
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,950
Ning and other people were gone.

326
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,760
I knew I shouldn't have left him.

327
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,760
You need to believe him.

328
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,920
He can survive.

329
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,230
Go to hell.

330
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,680
Father,

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,800
please don't be angry.

332
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,420
= Pageant Hall=

333
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,760
Yao,

334
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,760
are you OK?

335
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm good.

336
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Second bro, sit down please.

337
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,830
You shall go and get changed.

338
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,350
I can't walk away.

339
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,880
Childe Wei is too impulsive.

340
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,000
How could he say something like that

341
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,310
in front of the gentries.

342
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,280
Isn't what he said

343
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,590
right?

344
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,310
Yes, it is.

345
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Just because it's right,

346
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,710
he can't say that to everyone's face.

347
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,190
Nowadays Childe Wei's temperament

348
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,400
does have changed a lot.

349
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,590
Go

350
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,160
and do your best.

351
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,230
Why do we need his consent to punish Wen clan?

352
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,230
To so many Clan Leaders' face!

353
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,110
Besides, Clan Leader Jiang hasn't said anything yet.

354
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,160
Why should he say all that?

355
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,350
Go, go, go.

356
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
Clan Leader, we...

357
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,280
Madam.

358
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,400
Madam.

359
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,950
Madam.

360
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,880
Where is forth uncle?

361
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,470
Where is Ning?

362
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,070
Ning.

363
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Miss Wen.

364
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,920
Freeze.

365
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,350
Where are you from?

366
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,560
Who allows you to break in?

367
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,400
I want to find a person.

368
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,520
I want to find a person.

369
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,800
I don't care you look for a person or a ghost.

370
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,350
Go away.

371
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,520
If you don't go, I...

372
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,830
Ning.

373
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,640
Ning.

374
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,830
Ning.

375
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,000
Ning.

376
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,110
Have you seen Ning?

377
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
Have you seen Ning?

378
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,160
Have you seen Ning?

379
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,830
Ning.

380
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,880
Ning.

381
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,470
Have you seen Ning or not?

382
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,430
Ning?

383
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Ning. Ning.

384
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,520
Where is Ning?

385
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,950
Have you seen Ning?

386
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,680
Have you seen Ning?

387
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,070
Where is Wen Ning? Did you see him?

388
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,680
Get everyone over here.

389
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,160
Where are Wen clan's cultivators newly sent here?

390
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,430
These days,

391
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,710
are there some Wen clan's cultivators sent recently?

392
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,470
One of them stammers.

393
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,920
Do you see him?

394
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,430
Every prisoner of war here is a cultivator of Wen clan.

395
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,590
Everyday there are new people sent here.

396
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,710
They are all here.

397
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,160
I know he must be here.

398
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,830
Almost everyday people would come and ask for some cultivators.

399
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,160
I believe

400
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,520
he escaped.

401
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
He will never escape.

402
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,350
Since madam and other people are here,

403
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,000
Ning will never escape alone.

404
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,110
You are saying

405
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,280
everyone is here?

406
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,070
Well.

407
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,710
All... all of them are here.

408
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,710
All of them are here?

409
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,880
Good.

410
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,310
I believe you for the moment

411
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,950
that all the living people are here.

412
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,280
What about others?

413
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,280
Childe, mercy. Mercy.

414
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,310
I say. I say.

415
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,230
The corpses of Wen clan people

416
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,920
were thrown away in the valley.

417
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,400
We... we just followed the order.

418
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,710
It's none of our business.

419
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Take us there.

420
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,520
It's... it's...

421
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,110
in front of us.

422
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,040
Ning!

423
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,880
Ning!

424
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,880
Ning!

425
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,710
Ning!

426
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,950
Ning!

427
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,000
Ning!

428
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,430
Ning!

429
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,110
Ning!

430
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,280
Ning!

431
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,680
Ning!

432
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,430
Ning!

433
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,760
Ning!

434
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,880
Ning!

435
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,520
Ning!

436
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,760
Ning!

437
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,110
How's it going? Have you found him?

438
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,680
What else can it be?

439
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,160
Since Childe Jin was gone,

440
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,590
he has been left there for several days.

441
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,920
Even he didn't die at that time,

442
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,880
he is supposed to be a stinking corpse now.

443
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,950
What are you standing still for?

444
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,640
Wait for Wei Wuxian and the chick makeing trouble for us?

445
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,310
Go quickly. Go.

446
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,470
But wait.

447
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,470
Chide Jin ordered

448
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,880
those people are meant for testing,

449
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,110
which require a close eye on.

450
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,160
What if he blames us after we escape?

451
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,470
Now is your life

452
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,040
or those people more important?

453
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,520
I think we might as well kill those people

454
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,880
so they can't reveal

455
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,680
what we have done.

456
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,800
Then what are you waiting for?

457
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,310
Kill them first.

458
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,520
Childe, mercy. Childe, mercy. Childe, mercy.

459
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,110
Childe, mercy. Mercy, childe.

460
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,160
Childe, mercy. Mercy.

461
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,560
What kind of evil did you want to attract,

462
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,920
when plugging Spirit Lure Flags into their body?

463
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,350
Or

464
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,800
what kind of evil tricks did you want to practice?

465
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,070
Who killed them?

466
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,070
Childe Wei, please don't say that.

467
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,920
Here nobody dares to kill people.

468
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,430
Right.

469
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,160
Each of them was so careless at work

470
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,160
and fell down the hill.

471
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
Yes. Yes.

472
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,470
Nobody dares to kill people causally?

473
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,590
Yes, right, right. As true as fate.

474
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,640
No lies at all.

475
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,070
I see.

476
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,760
Because Wen clan...

477
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,680
because they are not people in your eyes.

478
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,760
So

479
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,080
here nobody dares to kill people causally.

480
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,670
Is that what you mean?

481
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,910
Or you really think

482
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,150
I can't tell your lies?

483
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,470
Jiang clan of Yunmeng and Jin clan of Lanling are in a good relationship.

484
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,190
Childe Wei, you can't...

485
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,430
You are very courageous.

486
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
Are you threatening me?

487
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,390
No. No. No.

488
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,950
Mercy, Childe Wei. Mercy, Childe Wei. Mercy, Childe Wei.

489
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,870
Since you don't admit it,

490
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,600
I'll let him to point it out himself.

491
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,000
Childe Wei, mercy. Childe Wei, mercy.

492
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,150
Mercy. Childe Wei, mercy,

493
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,470
Mercy, Childe Wei.

494
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,230
Childe Wei, mercy, mercy, mercy.

495
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,390
Childe Wen...

496
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,120
Ning.

497
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,710
Don't.

498
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,910
How could it be?

499
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
Wen Ning is not under control.

500
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,000
No.

501
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,280
Wen Ning.

502
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,870
No.

503
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,670
Wei Wuxian.

504
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,360
Stop it now.

505
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,710
Ning didn't die.

506
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,040
Just his spiritual cognition was taken.

507
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,950
Wen Ning.

508
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,670
Wen Qionglin.

509
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,710
What happened?

510
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
Someone. Someone came to their rescue.

511
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,800
Resurrected... resurrected to kill people!

512
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,150
Miss Wen.

513
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,190
Who are you?

514
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,670
What did you do to our office manager?

515
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,320
Nothing.

516
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,520
Who are cultivators of Wen Ning?

517
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,710
Cut the crap.

518
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,800
Stand out.

519
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,150
What's going on?

520
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,560
Everyone gets a horse.

521
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,430
Be quick.

522
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Childe Wei, this...

523
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,190
It's not time to explain.

524
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,390
Mount a horse and go.

525
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,040
Go.

526
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,560
Let's go. Go go go.

527
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,520
Go.

528
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,840
Lan Zhan,

529
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
you are here to stop me?

530
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,230
Wei Ying,

531
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,840
where are you going?

532
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,800
I have no idea.

533
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,760
But the world is wide.

534
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,150
There must be a place for us.

535
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,630
You need to think again.

536
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,000
If you go,

537
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,670
you'll rebel against orthodoxy for real,

538
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,600
with no way back.

539
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,600
Rebel against orthodoxy?

540
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,000
What kind of orthodoxy is that?

541
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,630
Lan Zhan,

542
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,630
do you still remember

543
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,390
the promise we have made together?
