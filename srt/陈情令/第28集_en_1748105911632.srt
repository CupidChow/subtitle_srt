1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one to be released.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one to be released.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one to be released.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You are in Yixing.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is he still human?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's the difference between killing狂e Lei and us?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wei Wuxian.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you?

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Jiang Cheng,

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,840
you also suspect that I took that Yin Tian.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,120
Even if he's not Kui Lei,

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
what's the difference between Kui Lei and me?

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,920
You want to awaken his mind,

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
it's a thousand thousand thousand thousand!

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Yes,

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,240
I also think it's too hard.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
But I've already

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
beaten up his sister.

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Now, they all believe that I can save him.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,920
So I must help this busy man.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Otherwise, I'll be in jail.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Where should I put it?

52
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
What are you doing?

53
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
What are you doing?

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I still want to ask you what you're doing?

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Wei Wuxian,

56
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
you've been very dangerous these days.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
What are you doing?

58
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Wen Qing,

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
you go out first.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Don't worry, I'm here.

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Wei Wuxian,

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
I've been forced by you.

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
These days,

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
there are many small people on the Golden Bells.

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm in pain.

66
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
They all want to ask me for an explanation.

67
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
So I'm here.

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
What explanation?

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
This matter has been settled.

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Those people in the capital

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
killed Wen Ning.

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Wen Ning killed them.

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
They killed people,

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
and owed money to them.

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
That's all.

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Anyway, they thought Wen Ning was dead.

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
That's all?

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
How is that possible?

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Do you know how many people are watching you?

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Watching you?

81
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Watching your evil spirit?

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
If they had the chance,

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
you would have been rude.

84
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
You've already said that

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
I would have been rude.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I'm not old,

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
what else can I do?

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Of course, you can.

89
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
The only way to get rid of them

90
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
is to take them before they move.

91
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Let's make a couple first.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
What do you want to do?

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Go back with me.

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Hand over all the people here.

95
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Are you kidding me?

96
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Hand over Wen Qing to them.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Except for being cleaned up,

98
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
there's no second step.

99
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
It's all in this.

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Why do you care about the step?

101
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Zhang Cheng!

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Listen to what you're saying.

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Take her back.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Don't force me to take you back.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Don't forget

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,920
who sent Uncle Jiang and Mrs. Yu back.

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
The ashes in the lotus house.

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Who sent them back?

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
When Wen Chao and I were chasing after them,

110
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
who was the one who killed them?

111
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Wei Wuxian!

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I really want to kill you.

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Yes, they did save us.

114
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
But why didn't you know?

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Now Wen's world is a big place.

116
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
As long as it's Wen,

117
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
it's the worst.

118
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
And the one who's protecting them

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
is the worst person in the world.

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Everyone hates Wen,

121
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
but they hate them more and more.

122
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
And as long as they're protecting them,

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
they're fighting with everyone.

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
No one will talk to them.

125
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,920
No one will talk to you.

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I don't need anyone to talk to me.

127
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
What kind of energy are you holding?

128
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
If you can't move,

129
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
just let me go.

130
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Wei Wuxian,

131
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
you're so different.

132
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
In front of the Four Great Clans,

133
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
you're a monster, a beggar,

134
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
a murderer, and a poison.

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
But as long as you're different from them,

136
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
it's you.

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm not a monster.

138
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm a monster.

139
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm a poison.

140
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm a poison.

141
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm a poison.

142
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
They're talking different voices.

143
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You're a cruel,

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
a malicious monster.

145
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
You think you can kill them all

146
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
and do nothing but act in a way that is unlawful.

147
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Without this power,

148
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
without this power,

149
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm going to be this power.

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Wei Wuxian,

151
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
don't you know what the situation is?

152
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Do you want me to tell you?

153
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
If you insist on protecting them,

154
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I can't keep you safe!

155
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
If you can't keep me safe,

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,400
then you're angry.

157
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,800
You're angry, aren't you?

158
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Tell the whole world

159
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
that I'm afraid of running away.

160
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
I, Wei Wuxian,

161
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
will do anything

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
from now on.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,360
It has nothing to do with the Jiang clan.

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
Wei Wuxian,

165
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
tell me.

166
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
What are you doing

167
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,080
for?

168
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm telling you,

169
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
Jiang Cheng,

170
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
even if it's not Wen Qing's second brother,

171
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,160
I'll do anything.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
I, Wei Wuxian,

173
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,400
will still make the same choice.

174
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,720
Wei Wuxian,

175
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,080
are you sick?

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,040
If you don't pull your head out and make some trouble,

177
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,880
will you die?

178
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,760
My mom is right.

179
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,520
You're the one who brought trouble to our family.

180
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,640
You know what you can do.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960
You know the value of the Jiang clan.

182
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,880
You know better than I do.

183
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
You all know!

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
Then let's make a deal.

185
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

186
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,760
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

187
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,760
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

188
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

189
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

190
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

191
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

192
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

193
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

194
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

195
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

196
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,440
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

197
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,840
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

198
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,040
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

199
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

200
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,800
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,120
It's beenyleateless, Uncle什么?

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,800
It's been no analogues in my news.

203
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,400
orders are everywhere,

204
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,640
so strange evidence can't be f chainsdraped to.

205
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,520
I don't know of any type of evidence nor.

206
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Here you are.

207
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Miss Qin,

208
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,640
are you feeling unwell today?

209
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
You haven't eaten anything.

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
You'd better keep it.

211
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,480
It's okay.

212
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm still young.

213
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes.

214
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,520
You should eat more.

215
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,840
These are for you.

216
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,720
Okay. I'll give them to you.

217
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Uncle Si.

218
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,960
Okay.

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,320
I'll give you the rest.

220
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,440
Okay.

221
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,440
When we grow something,

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,960
we don't need to catch fish and fruit every day.

223
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,840
Our yard

224
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,040
is delicious every day.

225
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,800
Yes.

226
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
I didn't expect a wild wild animal like this

227
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,400
to grow something like this.

228
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,440
Let's buy some seeds in the mountains

229
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,360
and plant vegetables.

230
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,560
We can go down the mountain?

231
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,280
Let's wait for a few days.

232
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,000
We'll talk when the wind blows.

233
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,680
Uncle Si said you'll eat this sweet.

234
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
I need you to do it.

235
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,760
Forget it.

236
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:53,800
You're too

237
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Sweet.

238
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Do you want to try it?

239
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't look at A Yuan as a child.

240
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
He might have eaten it.

241
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Today's fruit

242
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
is all eaten by him.

243
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
This is the last one.

244
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You really don't want to eat it?

245
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Okay.

246
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Wei Wuxian.

247
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
You should go.

248
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Go? Where are you going?

249
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Where will you go?

250
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Actually, it's quite good now.

251
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
As long as Anni is still by my side,

252
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
I will be satisfied.

253
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
I will be happy.

254
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I will be happy.

255
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
As long as Anni is by my side,

256
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I will be satisfied.

257
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

258
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
She can wake up her mind again.

259
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
She will be happy.

260
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
It's all settled here.

261
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I will take care of the rest.

262
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You are a man of the future.

263
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Unlike us.

264
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Wei Wuxian.

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Go.

266
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
You...

267
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
What?

268
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
You said you didn't want to eat it.

269
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Wei Wuxian.

270
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
What's wrong?

271
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I don't want to eat it.

272
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I don't want to eat it.

273
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Here you are.

274
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
You are so mean.

275
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Wei Wuxian.

276
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I said I will restore Wen Ning to normal.

277
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I will do it.

278
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I will do it.

279
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I will do it.

280
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
If you are here to persuade me,

281
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
don't talk to me.

282
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Mr. Jiang.

283
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I can't leave this book.

284
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
I can't leave it.

285
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I can't leave it.

286
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I can't leave it.

287
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I can't leave it.

288
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I can't leave it.

289
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I can't leave it.

290
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I can't leave it.

291
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Why didn't you take it?

292
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Why didn't you come to Lanling City to see me?

293
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
If I met you in Lanling City first,

294
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
would you take me to save Ning?

295
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
I will go to the palace.

296
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I will go to the palace.

297
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I will go to the palace.

298
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I will go to the palace.

299
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I will go to the palace.

300
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I will go to the palace.

301
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I will go to the palace.

302
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I will go to the palace.

303
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I will go to the palace.

304
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
I will go to the palace.

305
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I will go to the palace.

306
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Ning.

307
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
We met Wei Wuxian.

308
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Is it a letter?

309
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Or a letter?

310
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Sister.

311
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Ning.

312
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Sister.

313
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Ning.

314
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Ning.

315
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Ning.

316
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Ning.

317
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Ning.

318
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Ning.

319
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Don't be afraid.

320
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Where is she?

321
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Ning.

322
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Don't be afraid.

323
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Ning.

324
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Ning.

325
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Sister.

326
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Ning.

327
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Don't be afraid.

328
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Don't be afraid.

329
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Ning.

330
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Ning.

331
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Ning.

332
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Ning.

333
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Ning.

334
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Ning.

335
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Ning.

336
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Ning.

337
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Ning.

338
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Ning.

339
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Ning.

340
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Jiang Cheng, you are so mean.

341
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Are you so cruel?

342
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Headmaster.

343
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Headmaster.

344
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
You are so cruel.

345
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
You sent me here to tell the world

346
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
that Wei Wuxian is treasonous.

347
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
You are against the Zhong family.

348
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,800
The Jiang family has been formed.

349
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Headmaster, are you really...

350
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,800
From now on, Wei Wuxian and I,

351
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
the Jiang family,

352
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,960
Luan Du TOMB!

353
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,100
Why

354
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Channel

355
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
Beyoncé

356
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,660
She

357
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
A-Xie!

358
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660

A-Xie!

362
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,660
A-Xie, where are you going?

363
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
A-Xie, this way!

364
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
A-Xie!

365
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
Thank you!

Cheng!

370
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Cheng!

371
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Look at A-Xie!

372
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
A-Xie is in the wrong!

373
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
Let her come back!

374
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660

375
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
A-Xie!

376
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,660
A-Xie, come back!

377
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,660
A-Xie!

378
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Miss Jiang!

379
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Miss Jiang!

380
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Miss Jiang, are you there?

381
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Miss Jiang!

382
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Miss Jiang, are you there?

383
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
I'm here.

384
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Is there anything?

385
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Miss Jiang, please go to the hall.

386
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
But my brother Jiang Cheng is back.

387
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Chief Jiang hasn't returned yet.

388
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
I see.

389
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
Please go back to Miss Jiang.

390
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
I'll go there in a while.

391
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Yes.

392
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
I'll go back to the hall.

393
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
You're here.

394
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,660
I've bought the potatoes.

395
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,660
I'll plant them tomorrow.

396
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,660
Don't look at me like that.

397
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
I've bought them.

398
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,660
Don't be obsessed with your carrot anymore.

399
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Oh, right.

400
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
I bought some meat here.

401
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Have a seat.

402
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
I'll open a wedding for everyone tonight.

403
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Hey!

404
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
What are you doing?

405
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
You're not even close to your uncle.

406
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,660
You're suddenly like this.

407
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
I'm scared.

408
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
I'm scared.

409
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
Okay, okay.

410
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
I know you're trying to heal my wound.

411
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,660
But I really have no problem.

412
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
Look.

413
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,660
If you don't cook,

414
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
I might really have to die.

415
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
You're so hungry.

416
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Where are you going?

417
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
I'm going to get some radishes.

418
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
I'm going to get some radishes.

419
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
I told you not to come in.

420
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
Mr. Jin.

421
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
You go up first.

422
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Okay.

423
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,660
I didn't mean to intrude.

424
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
Sorry.

425
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,660
Mrs. Jin called me here.

426
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,660
Oh, it's okay.

427
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Why haven't you come back yet?

428
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
I feel a little has Latin.

429
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
But...

430
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
She's not here.

431
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,660
It doesn't hurt to go back to Lianghuawu.

432
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
About Lianghuawu?

433
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Everything looked so good on me.

434
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin.

435
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Miss Jin.

436
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
I know.

437
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
This is not a lotus house.

438
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
But I...

439
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,660
But I'd like to see another lotus house for you.

440
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
This is not a lotus house.

441
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
But I...

442
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,660
But I'd like to see another lotus house for you.

443
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Miss Jin.

444
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
Miss Jin.

445
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Zi Xu.

446
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
Zi Xu.

447
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Zi Xu.

448
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Zi Xu.

449
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Zi Xu.

450
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Zi Xu.

451
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Zi Xu.

452
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Zi Xu.

453
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
If I say it,

454
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
this Yiling's family

455
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
is a disaster.

456
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Who said it's not?

457
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
I'm telling you.

458
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,660
The ancestors of the great aunt of the neighbor's neighbor's family

459
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
have been abandoned recently.

460
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
It must be him.

461
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Listen.

462
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
I'm telling you.

463
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
I heard he was practicing the body.

464
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,660
He was so scary.

465
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
He was in the Qiong Qi Road.

466
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,660
He was a man who was made a puppet

467
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,660
and killed a dozen people.

468
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,660
But the puppet was still a man of the world.

469
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Since then,

470
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,660
people call him General Gui.

471
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,660
But after Qiong Qi Road,

472
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,660
no one knows the direction of General Gui.

473
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Where else can he go?

474
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,660
He must be hungry with the ancestors of the Yiling.

475
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,660
You know nothing but Qiong Qi Road.

476
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
The fear of the ancestors of the Yiling

477
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,660
is not just a puppet.

478
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Those tricks

479
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,660
are so powerful.

480
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Listen.

481
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,660
He did those things

482
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,660
to save the ancestors' lives.

483
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,660
If Yun Meng didn't take him with him,

484
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
he would be a traitor

485
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,660
who is a traitor to the Yiling.

486
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,660
He betrayed the master

487
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,660
and hurt the little princess.

488
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,660
He is a man of the world.

489
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,660
Yes.

490
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
He is a traitor.

491
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
He should be killed.

492
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
It's strange.

493
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
Who is he?

494
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
He looks like a man

495
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
who is in front of me.

496
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
What's going on?

497
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
Boss,

498
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
you are all deaf.

499
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
What do you want?

500
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,660
It's cheaper.

501
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
No, you won't dance without a deaf.

502
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,660
I am not deaf.

503
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
I don't have many good ones.

504
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,660
Look.

505
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,660
You are not deaf.

506
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
You are not.

507
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
No.

508
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,660
Forget it.

509
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,660
I don't want to buy it.

510
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Just take one.

511
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,660
Maybe it's poisonous.

512
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
You think so?

513
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,660
Yun.

514
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,660
Yun.

515
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Yun.

516
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,660
What are you doing?

517
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,660
What's wrong?

518
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Why are you crying so much?

519
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
Did you get scolded by him?

520
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,660
I didn't.

521
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
Listen.

522
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Look.

523
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,660
It's his father.

524
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
It must be his father.

525
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Look at his nose.

526
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
He is a man of the world.

527
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
He is a man of the world.

528
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,660
He is a man of the world.

529
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
He is so cruel.

530
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Look at him.

531
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Did he get scolded by his father?

532
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
He is so cruel.

533
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
He is a man of the world.

534
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
He is so young.

535
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Is he the first man of the world?

536
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
I was like this.

537
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
I didn't understand anything.

538
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
I was so angry.

539
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,660
I understood everything.

540
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
I had to learn it slowly.

541
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
Where is your mother?

542
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
She is crying.

543
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
Where is your mother?

544
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
It's her father.

545
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Where is your mother?

546
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Lan Zhan.

547
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Forget it.

548
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Why are you going?

549
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Let's go.

550
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,660
Let's go.

551
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Lan Zhan.

552
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
What a coincidence.

553
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Why are you here?

554
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
I'm here to see you.

555
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
This child.

556
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
This child.

557
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,660
I'm born.

558
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
By the way, Lan Zhan.

559
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
What did you do just now?

560
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
Why did you make her cry?

561
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
I didn't do anything.

562
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
I see.

563
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,660
Lan Zhan, you are pretty.

564
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
But you are all a bitter and grumpy child.

565
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,660
This child is still young.

566
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
He doesn't know how to distinguish between ugly and ugly.

567
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
So, you are the only one who doesn't like him.

568
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
You are going to cry.

569
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Lan Zhan, look.

570
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Look.

571
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
It's a toy.

572
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
Look.

573
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Look.

574
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
It's a toy.

575
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Look.

576
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Look.

577
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,660
Look at this.

578
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Look.

579
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
It's pretty.

580
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
It's pretty.

581
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Let's go.

582
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
Look.

583
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Do you like it?

584
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
I do.

585
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
You do?

586
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
You really like it?

587
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
Boss.

588
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Let's go.

589
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
Wei Ying.

590
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
Why didn't you buy it for her?

591
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
Why would I buy it for her?

592
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,660
You asked if she wanted it or not.

593
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,660
Didn't you want to buy it for her?

594
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,660
I asked.

595
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
I bought it.

596
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
I said I would buy it if I asked.

597
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
You want it?

598
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Here.

599
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
I want it.

600
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Here.

601
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
Come on.

602
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,660
Come on.

603
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Come on.

604
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,660
Come on.

605
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,660
Come on.

606
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
The children like it.

607
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Come on.

608
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,660
Boss.

609
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
Look.

610
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Wow.

611
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Nan Zhan.

612
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Congratulations.

613
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
He likes you.

614
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
He likes who will hug whom.

615
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
And he will never let go.

616
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,660
I think

617
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,660
you should stop being so impulsive.

618
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Let's have a meal together.

619
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,660
Let's have a meal.

620
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,660
Don't be so cold.

621
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,660
I finally came to Yiling.

622
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,660
I was touched by you.

623
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,660
Let's go.

624
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Let's go.

625
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,660
I'll treat you.

626
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,660
I'm sorry.

627
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
I'm sorry.

628
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I'm sorry.

629
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
I'm sorry.

630
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,660
The End
