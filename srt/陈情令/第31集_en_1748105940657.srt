00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one to be released.

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one to be released.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one to be released.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000

The fifth one is the first one to be released.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The fifth one is the first one to be released.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't go.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't go.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yuan.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yuan, you can't eat these lotus seeds.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't eat these lotus seeds.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, you can't eat these lotus seeds.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can't eat these lotus seeds.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
These lotus seeds are the lotus seeds that grow out of the soil of the Tibetan River.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They are the things that protect your body and your blood.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So, come on, Xiao Shou.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can take it with you.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But you can't eat it.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you know that?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Good boy.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go find the mother.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yuan, let's go.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Go.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What is this?

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A bow from a golden-grey land.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I got it from the mountain.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No words.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Sister, what's wrong?

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Did something happen?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wei Wuxian.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's wrong?

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You can go to see your senior sister.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sister.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The gold market is really a happy event.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The gold-grey young master is full of money.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The gold market is full of people.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The heart is still thinking about the Liao Wangtai in the world.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Liao Wangtai?

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It seems that the other families are looking for this.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you sure?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's so good about it?

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think this Liao Wangtai is pretty good.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In the past,

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you can monitor the movements of all places.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In the second place, you can get the news in time.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know what you're against.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's not good.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What if

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
there's another market for monitoring?

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Can it be the same?

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Liao Wangtai is just a rich family.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's from the hundred families to control you.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's true.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But in the same management,

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
it's not the last time that Lian Ling comes to the gold market.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I heard that it was Mr. Jin Guangyao who mentioned it.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Even if the Chifeng Village doesn't agree to build Liao Wangtai,

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the gold-grey son's full moon ceremony

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is still going to the factory.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The full moon ceremony is really a big event.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All the families are moving out.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Did you hear that?

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I did hear that.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I also attended his seven-day ceremony.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That kid

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
was playing a game of flower and green.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He was holding his father's jade.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But he broke his parents' heart.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Flirt.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He told me

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,440
This kid will definitely be a great swordsman in the future.

111
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Lan Lin is really a great swordsman.

112
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,120
A little baby's annual ceremony is so grand.

113
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,560
Don't you think that the little baby's parents are all the same?

114
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,720
Can they be so great?

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Don't say that the husband of the little princess doesn't want to be great.

116
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,040
If the stage is a little smaller,

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,320
who would be the one to be proud of her mother and brother?

118
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,480
I'm afraid that this full moon ceremony will be even more disastrous.

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Yes.

120
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
You said that...

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
The little princess is really lucky.

122
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,080
I'm afraid that the previous event gave up the flight

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,480
and that's why she's so lucky.

124
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,960
It seems that the good thing about it is that it's not as good as it seems.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
The person is obviously the same.

126
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,040
Do you know that?

127
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,000
It's said that in this full moon ceremony,

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
there's a person who's invited.

129
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Who is it?

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Who is it?

131
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Wei Wuxian.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Wei Wuxian?

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
How could it be him?

134
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,760
Wei Wuxian?

135
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,840
I don't know what Lan Lin really thinks about this.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Is it because Wei Wuxian was in the Qiong Qi Sect?

137
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,360
Did they all forget about it?

138
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,680
Of course not.

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,280
Why would Lan Lin Jin clan come to the capital in such a short time?

140
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,120
Who dares to go?

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Anyway, I won't go.

142
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm afraid that Wei Wuxian is so lucky.

143
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,440
I won't go if I don't go.

144
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
This time, I don't know what will happen.

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,280
Boss, it's her.

146
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,480
Yes.

147
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,160
She's just a disaster.

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,080
Yes.

149
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,120
I don't know what will happen.

150
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,600
Here, the new ticket.

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
Sir, have you bought it?

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,280
It's so beautiful.

153
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Listen,

154
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,680
these beautiful little things are not cheap.

155
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Anyway, the money you gave me

156
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,280
is not worth it.

157
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,080
Go back and wait and see.

158
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,680
No, no.

159
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
The child you gave to Miss Jiang is a gift.

160
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I won't blame you.

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,080
You said that.

162
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
If you go back and scold me,

163
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
you can beat me.

164
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Young Master Jin Ling will definitely like this gift.

165
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Listen,

166
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
this is not the gift I gave her.

167
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
It's just a small gift.

168
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Moreover,

169
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
this is the place where the treasure box is.

170
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
These things are beautiful.

171
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
What are the other things left?

172
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Then, Young Master,

173
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680
what gift did you prepare?

174
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
What a great dress.

175
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Young Master,

176
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,260
you can't get out of the

177
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,680
house in half a month.

178
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
You're doing this?

179
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Not bad.

180
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,680
As long as my nephew is hanging this,

181
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
he's a very low-key monster.

182
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Don't try to get into his body.

183
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Don't touch it.

184
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
I think you touched it.

185
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
It's strong enough.

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
I feel like I'm out.

187
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
But, Young Master,

188
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
since you're going to attend

189
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
the full moon of Young Master Jin Ling,

190
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,680
you must hold on to Miss Jiang's government.

191
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Don't get in the way of her.

192
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Don't worry about that.

193
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I have my own reasons.

194
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I won't talk about it

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
in a year

196
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
if I invite her to the flower pit.

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I saw the bow of Lan Lin Jin City

198
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
before.

199
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I wondered if it was a good idea.

200
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Now, I think I misunderstood.

201
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Young Master Jin is a good man.

202
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Besides,

203
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
there's also Young Master Lan.

204
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I didn't expect

205
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
we'd come back here again.

206
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Yes.

207
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Young Master.

208
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
What's the matter?

209
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Nothing.

210
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
It's quiet.

211
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
It's too quiet.

212
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
Let's go.

213
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Who are you?

214
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Wei Wuxian.

215
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm warning you.

216
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Let me clear the curse on me.

217
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
I can do anything.

218
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
I can't do anything.

219
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
What curse?

220
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
You're pretending to be a good man?

221
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Fine.

222
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
I'll show you

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
what kind of curse it is.

224
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Qiancheng White Claw?

225
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes.

226
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
It's Qiancheng White Claw.

227
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
You're a good man.

228
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Why are you trying to get me?

229
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
What's the matter?

230
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Other than you,

231
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
who else would

232
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
put these evil things

233
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
on me

234
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
besides you?

235
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I don't even remember who you are.

236
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
I'll try my best

237
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
to make you feel bad.

238
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Besides,

239
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
I don't play

240
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
the tricks in the harem.

241
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
If I were to kill someone,

242
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,680
I'd tell the whole world

243
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
that I'd die.

244
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
And if I really wanted you to die,

245
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
you'd be a thousand times more miserable than now.

246
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Aren't you a big deal?

247
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
What?

248
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
You dare to do it or not?

249
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I didn't do it wrong.

250
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Why should I do it?

251
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
You're a criminal.

252
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Since you can't turn your back on the case,

253
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
don't blame me for being rude.

254
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
What do you want to do?

255
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Since you don't want to

256
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
remove the curse on me,

257
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I'll kill you.

258
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Kill me?

259
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
You?

260
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Or these people?

261
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Since you're the one who's going to die,

262
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,680
don't blame me for that?

263
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
No.

264
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
No.

265
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Your Majesty!

266
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Your Majesty!

267
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
No!

268
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Wei Wuxian,

269
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
this is the price you're going to pay me.

270
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Without the sword,

271
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
how can you resist?

272
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
You're going to pay me?

273
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
You're going to pay me?

274
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
You're going to pay me?

275
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
You're going to pay me?

276
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
You're going to pay me?

277
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
You're going to pay me?

278
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
You're going to pay me?

279
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
You're going to pay me?

280
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
You're going to pay me?

281
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
You're going to pay me?

282
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
You're going to pay me?

283
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
You're going to pay me?

284
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
You're going to pay me?

285
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
You're going to pay me?

286
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
You're going to pay me?

287
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
You're going to pay me?

288
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
You're going to pay me?

289
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
You're going to pay me?

290
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
You're going to pay me?

291
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
You're going to pay me?

292
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
You're going to pay me?

293
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
You're going to pay me?

294
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
You're going to pay me?

295
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
You're going to pay me?

296
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
You're going to pay me?

297
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
You're going to pay me?

298
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
You're going to pay me?

299
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
You're going to pay me?

300
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Give it back to me.

301
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,680
This is the gift you gave to the child?

302
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Don't you really think you can participate in the child's full month's banquet?

303
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Stop it!

304
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Zi Xuan? What are you doing here?

305
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,680
What are you doing here?

306
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Where's Jin Wang Yao?

307
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
She's at the Golden Forest Platform.

308
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
If A Yao finds out that the army has told me,

309
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,680
do you really want to keep everyone from making such a mess?

310
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
You're in a state of a thousand holes.

311
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Why didn't you tell me at all?

312
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
You're doing such a thing without a single word.

313
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,680
Zi Xuan, you can keep the ground for me.

314
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
When I remove these things from you,

315
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll go apologize to you.

316
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
I'll go apologize to you.

317
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,680
You've already stopped the exchange of the jade.

318
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,680
What else can you return to her?

319
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Didn't you see the things on me?

320
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I've already heard A Yao say it.

321
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Since you've already heard her,

322
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
you should understand that I can't wait any longer.

323
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Do you think that because she's the junior's junior,

324
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
you're doing this for the junior,

325
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
not to mention the brother's death?

326
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
You clearly know that I'm not that kind of person.

327
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Moreover, the thousand holes on your body

328
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
might not have been made by her.

329
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Why are you so anxious?

330
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Wei Wuxian is after all invited to attend the child's full month's banquet.

331
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
In this way,

332
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
you can't be my brother or my wife.

333
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,680
It's best if she can't attend the banquet.

334
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
What does Wei Wuxian give her?

335
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
What right does she have to attend our family's banquet?

336
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Whoever is her,

337
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
whoever is the one who has the black water.

338
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Zixuan, if you invite her here today,

339
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
don't be afraid that after the ceremony,

340
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,680
you, your younger sister, and your child

341
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
will have a life full of

342
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
endless 5 points.

343
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Shut up!

344
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Wei Wuxian, are you done?

345
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
You first let Wen Ning stop.

346
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Tell her not to go crazy again.

347
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Then you'll make things worse.

348
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Why don't you let them stop?

349
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
It's already this time.

350
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Why are you still so strong?

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Calm down first.

352
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Come to the Golden Bell Tower with me.

353
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Tell me clearly and make a theory.

354
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
As long as it's not what you did,

355
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
it's natural.

356
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Stop it.

357
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,680
As long as I call Wen Ning to stop it,

358
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
the thousand swords will be cast.

359
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,680
The thousand swords will be passed down to you.

360
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,680
How can I make the Golden Bell Tower make a theory with you?

361
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
You won't.

362
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
You won't.

363
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
What are you holding?

364
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Golden Bell Tower, I have a question.

365
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
When you invited me here,

366
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,680
you really didn't know that they were going to kill me?

367
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
You...

368
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Wei Wuxian, are you crazy?

369
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Golden Bell Tower,

370
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
let me go.

371
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
I don't know you,

372
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,680
but you don't want to mess with me.

373
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Golden Bell Tower,

374
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm warning you.

375
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't come any closer.

376
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Wei Wuxian,

377
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
why don't you dare to be soft?

378
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Do you know that Ah Li is still...

379
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Ah Li...

380
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Ah Li...

381
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Ah Li...

382
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:00,680
My son, my son, will be with you for the rest of your life.

383
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:07,680
My son, my son, will be with you forever.

384
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,680
My son, my son, will be with you forever.

385
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:38,680
My son, my son, will be with you forever.

386
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Fang Jie! Fang Jie!

387
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Fang Jie! Fang Jie!

388
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Fang Jie! Fang Jie!

389
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Fang Jie! Fang Jie!

390
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Princess Jing has been killed!

391
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Hurry up! Hurry up!

392
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Princess Jing has been killed!

393
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Princess Jing!

394
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Hello.

395
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Why are they still here? They should have come back earlier.

396
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Maybe something is wrong on the way.

397
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Don't worry. Let's wait a little longer.

398
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Where is Jin Guangyao?

399
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Jin Guangyao? How would I know?

400
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Maybe he has arranged for his wife to go back to the hospital.

401
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Why are you asking him?

402
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Wei Ying hasn't arrived yet?

403
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
No.

404
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Lord Han Guang, is something wrong?

405
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Lord Han Guang.

406
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Why did my brother bring the boy to the Lan family?

407
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
He will leave Jinling with Jin Zixun.

408
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Where did they go?

409
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Do you know?

410
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Lord Han Guang, don't worry.

411
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Zi Xun indeed went to the Qiong Qi Road.

412
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
But it's not the end of the story.

413
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Zi Xun has already gone there.

414
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
I think...

415
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
It's too late!

416
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Lord Lianfang!

417
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
What happened?

418
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Lord Lianfang!

419
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
General Gui! General Gui has been killed!

420
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
What?

421
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Tell me clearly!

422
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Lord Shao! Lord Shao!

423
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
General Gui killed him!

424
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Lord Shao! Lord Shao!

425
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Sister!

426
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Sister!

427
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
It's too late!

428
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
It's too late!

429
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
It's too late!

430
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Too late!

431
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
It's too late!

432
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,680
How could he do this?

433
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
It's too late!

434
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:49,500
We've been waiting this

435
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Wei Wuxian.

436
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
You killed whom?

437
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
You don't know who you killed?

438
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Who did you kill?

439
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
You killed me.

440
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,500
You killed me.

441
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
You killed me.

442
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
You killed me.

443
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Hey!

444
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Brother Xian! Brother Xian!

445
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Brother Xian!

446
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Who are you going to kill?

447
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Why are you going to kill Jin Zixuan?

448
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Why?

449
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
What if you kill Jin Zixuan?

450
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
What if you let the world do?

451
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
What if you let A'Ling do?

452
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
What if you let me do?

453
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Brother Xian!

454
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
I'll take you to a big butterfly, okay?

455
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
I won't cry.

456
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
I won't cry.

457
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I won't cry.

458
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Why did I put myself in the middle of the world

459
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
all these years?

460
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Why did I have to make myself

461
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
into this?

462
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Am I crazy?

463
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I'm sorry.

465
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
It's all my fault.

466
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Is it his fault?

468
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
He turned into this.

469
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Is it his fault?

470
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Who told me

471
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
what I was going to do?

472
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Who told me?

473
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Is it his fault?

475
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
When you woke up,

476
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
we were in the mountains.

477
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
We've already discussed it.

478
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
What did you discuss?

479
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't talk nonsense.

480
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Get out of the way.

481
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
I've discussed it with my sister.

482
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I went to the Golden Forest Hall.

483
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm sorry.

484
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Sorry?

485
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
What's your fault?

486
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
My father's fault.

487
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
He committed suicide.

488
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
You've been lying here all day.

489
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
The people from the Golden Forest

490
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
sent people to mess with the Han River.

491
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
What are you talking about?

492
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Don't talk nonsense.

493
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm telling you clearly.

494
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
The Golden Forest Hall

495
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
wants you to give them an explanation.

496
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Listen to them.

497
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
As long as you hand us over,

498
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
this matter will be over.

499
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Please lie down for a few days.

500
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
This will be a real three-day trip.

501
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I'll keep an eye on Uncle and Uncle.

502
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I'll take good care of you.

503
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Nonsense!

504
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
I told you to do this!

505
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Hurry and take me down!

506
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Take me down!

507
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I'll take you down!

508
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
The Golden Forest Hall's fault

509
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
wasn't my fault.

510
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
But they've already decided that...

511
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Wenjing,

512
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
the general way of the evil clan

513
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
is to fight back with him

514
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
and reflect on the person who's lost.

515
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Now,

516
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
we just need to find

517
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
the trace of the evil clan

518
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
with whom we can reflect on.

519
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
I will never

520
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
have the trace of the evil clan.

521
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
It's useless.

522
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Why?

523
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Why not?

524
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
People are busy.

525
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Where should we look for it?

526
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Is it possible that

527
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
every road in the city

528
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
is a coffin?

529
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Is it possible that everyone

530
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
will be able to check it?

531
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Why not?

532
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
No one can ask you

533
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
to set up such a coffin.

534
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
And how long will it take?

535
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Maybe ten to eight years.

536
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
But are they willing to wait?

537
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
But I'm trying to...

538
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I really don't want the evil clan

539
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
to have that trace of the evil clan.

540
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Did they ask you

541
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
when they were going to kill you today?

542
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
No.

543
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Yes.

544
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
They didn't ask.

545
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
They just killed you.

546
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Do you understand?

547
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
You don't need any evidence.

548
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
You don't need to find out the truth.

549
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Is there any trace of the evil clan

550
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
that doesn't matter at all?

551
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
You are a great leader.

552
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
You are a great leader.

553
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Even if you don't have

554
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
any evidence, it's not strange.

555
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
And you don't need

556
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
to do anything

557
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
to get rid of Xia Zhou.

558
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
You can't get rid of her.

559
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Until now,

560
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
it doesn't matter

561
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
who made the hole in the window.

562
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
The most important thing is

563
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
the people who are in the Qiong Qi Road

564
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
and

565
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Jin Zixuan.

566
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
They really killed you.

567
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
But

568
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I should go too.

569
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I'm the one who control the people in Qiong Qi Road.

570
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm the one who turned them into people in the dead.

571
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
I let them kill people.

572
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Why can't they be killed?

573
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
I want a knife.

574
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
If I can't get rid of them,

575
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I want a knife.

576
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Wei Ying,

577
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
we all know

578
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
that Wen Ning is a knife.

579
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
A knife that makes them afraid.

580
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
But it's also

581
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
a knife that they attack you

582
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
as a tool.

583
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
We have no

584
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
this knife.

585
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
They don't have a knife.

586
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
This matter may be over.

587
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
But you all know

588
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
what the cause of the death is.

589
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Didn't you feel the pain?

590
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
We should

591
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
get rid of the cause.

592
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,500
In the end,

593
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
we should have died long ago.

594
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
These days,

595
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
we have to

596
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
kill the people in Qiong Qi Road.

597
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
These days,

598
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
we all have to die.

599
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Mother, help me up.

600
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I've finished talking.

601
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
I've told you everything.

602
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
I've said goodbye.

603
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
See you.

604
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
No problem.

605
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
I've never told you this before.

606
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
But today,

607
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
I've told you

608
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
some things.

609
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
If not,

610
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I really won't have a chance.

611
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
No.

612
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
And...

614
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Thank you.

615
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I'm sorry.

617
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
I'm sorry.

618
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I'm sorry.

619
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I'm sorry.

620
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
You're a traitor.

621
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
You can't kill your son.

622
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
You're the one who killed the people.

623
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
You're guilty.

624
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm sorry.

625
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Today,

626
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I've told you

627
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
to stop the war.

628
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I've told you

629
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
to stop the war.

630
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
I've told you

631
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
to stop the war.

632
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
I've told you

633
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
to stop the war.

634
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500

to stop the war.

642
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500

643
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500

664

I've told you

667
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
to stop the war.

668

I've told you

669
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
to stop the war.

670
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
I've told you

671
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500

676
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Can I do it?

677
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
What?

678
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
That's what you told me to do.

679
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500

I think

684
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
the war will be ended.

685
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
I'm sorry.

686
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I have to go.

687
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Thank you.

688
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
No.

689
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
No.

690
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
No.

691
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
No.

692
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
No.

693
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
No.

694
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
No.

695
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
