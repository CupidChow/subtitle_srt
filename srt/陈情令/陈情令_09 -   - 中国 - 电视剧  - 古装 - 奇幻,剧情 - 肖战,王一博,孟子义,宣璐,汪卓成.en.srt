00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 09

3
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,120
The Dire Owl!

4
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
The damn bird again.

5
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
Did we fall into a trap?

6
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
Help! Bro Wei! Bro Lan!

7
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,960
Why the unlucky one is always me!

8
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,600
Danger!

9
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't.

10
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Not dead yet.

11
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
You forgot. You said it.

12
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Look at their pupils.

13
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,800
Lan Zhan,

14
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
do you have any good solution?

15
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,440
Dash.

16
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,040
Wait, wait, wait. Bro Lan. Bro Wei.

17
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
Isn't it reckless

18
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,520
for us to dash through them?

19
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
Shall we discuss about it?

20
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,400
If we go out like this, aren't we courting death?

21
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,375
Bro Wei, I really don't want to die.

22
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,075
My canary...

23
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
Listen. Bro Nie.

24
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Once we get out,

25
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,240
you must cling to me.

26
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't let go of my hand, got it?

27
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,000
Never let it go, understand?

28
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,720
Let's go.

29
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Don't move!

30
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,720
Don't move!

31
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,400
She...

32
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
Why does she appear again?

33
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,613
You ignorant rushed into the Tiannv Temple.

34
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:42,260
What punishment do you think you deserve?

35
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,960
Don't punish us! Don't punish us!

36
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Wei Wuxian.

37
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,425
You departed without permission.

38
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,850
Do you plead guilty?

39
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Jiang Cheng,

40
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
if you don't come out immediately,

41
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,440
Lan Zhan will lose his temper.

42
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Why are you here, Jiang Cheng?

43
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,960
You can come. Why can't I?

44
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
It's fun to travel around all the way, isn't it?

45
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Without you harping on me,

46
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,600
I am much more at ease.

47
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
You have the nerve to say that?

48
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,840
You just disappeared with a note left.

49
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Do you know how worried I...

50
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
how worried my sister is?

51
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
Bro Jiang.

52
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
If you wanted to frighten Brother Wei, that's OK.

53
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,800
Why did you even upset me and Bro Lan?

54
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,400
We are...

55
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,670
The silencing charm is lifted?

56
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm upset for the journey to here because of you guys .

57
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,280
All right, Jiang Cheng.

58
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,840
It was me who wanted to follow Lanzhan.

59
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,320
You can't blame him.

60
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,480
I haven't blamed you yet. You're speaking for him.

61
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
I don't know what you're going to do.

62
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
But you have seen how dangerous it is.

63
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
But for Miss Wen this time...

64
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
Miss Wen?

65
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
Wen Qing also has come here?

66
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,440
Damn it.

67
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,840
How long after the whistle stopped?

68
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,360
I hope that Miss Wen is not in danger.

69
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,160
Where is she now?

70
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,520
Why do you come together?

71
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Miss Wen.

72
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,480
It's the Dire Owl again.

73
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Is Wen Chao nearby?

74
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,720
Why on earth does he want to kill us?

75
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,040
Miss Wen, are you okay?

76
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
Childe Jiang.

77
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,080
Didn't I tell you to save them and leave?

78
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,800
Miss Wen,

79
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
why are you here?

80
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
They, they are coming again!

81
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,360
You should leave now.

82
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,560
Let's go together.

83
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,240
I can't.

84
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,360
Childe Jiang, you promised me.

85
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,560
You would listen to me for coming here.

86
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,920
Take them away quickly.

87
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
You can't save them, Miss Wen.

88
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,880
You should go before it's too late.

89
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,800
You know how to save them?

90
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,360
Doesn't the Dancing Peri extract people's spiritual cognition?

91
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,560
They can be saved?

92
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,040
Wen Qing.

93
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,760
I don't care why you're here.

94
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,720
But we're all stuck here right now.

95
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,440
If we want to get out, we have to work together.

96
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,240
If you know how to get them back to normal,

97
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,560
I hope you can tell me now.

98
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,440
Okay.

99
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,600
I'll tell you.

100
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,040
At present, they are not manipulated very well.

101
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,240
Wen Chao only borrowed the power of Yin Iron

102
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,960
sealed on the Dire Owl by Wen Ruohan

103
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
to control them.

104
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
If you really want to help them,

105
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
kill the Dire Owl first.

106
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,970
You should have told us earlier.

107
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
Wei Ying, set up a Golden Silk Barrier to protect them.

108
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,240
What are you doing? Wei Wuxian!

109
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,920
Bro Wei, this won't last long.

110
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,760
Do you want us dead?

111
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
Jiang Cheng, you have the ability to protect them well.

112
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
Take care of them.

113
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,240
You...

114
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,880
If it won't last, add a layer of protection.

115
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
You're good at this.

116
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,080
You must protect them well.

117
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,040
I wanted to kill that owl long ago.

118
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait till we are back.

119
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,240
Wait for us.

120
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,120
Wei Wuxian!

121
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,600
You bastard.

122
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,760
Lan Zhan!

123
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,360
Where are you, Lan Zhan?

124
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,440
Lan Zhan!

125
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
Where are you, Lan Zhan?

126
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,640
Lan Zhan!

127
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,080
Lan Zhan!

128
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,160
What, what's going on?

129
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,520
Listen.

130
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,760
What kind of a bird it is?

131
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,080
It's more astute than I am.

132
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,840
Lan Zhan!

133
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,680
Where are you, Lan Zhan?

134
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
Not good. Not good. Not good.

135
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
Was Lan Zhan caught by the Dire Owl?

136
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm next to you.

137
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,680
You should have said something.

138
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,600
The mist is brought by the hallucinations made by the Dire Owl.

139
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,840
Don't worry.

140
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,160
I can break it up with a Glitter Talisman.

141
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
This hallucination can not only disorient people,

142
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,520
but also disturb the mind.

143
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,760
We can't concentrate at all now.

144
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
That's strange.

145
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,720
Why haven't you been disturbed?

146
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,680
The Dire Owl's hallucination

147
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,900
is the more disturbing

148
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,175
the more thoughts you have in mind.

149
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,320
Obviously, it is making use of my wisdom.

150
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,520
Lan Zhan.

151
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,280
Are you all right?

152
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,400
Fine.

153
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,160
Did you see who controled the bird?

154
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
No.

155
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,680
Wei Ying.

156
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,600
Close the Five Senses.

157
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,960
Fire-split Talisman.

158
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,160
Wei Wuxian, you wretch.

159
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,120
Come back quickly!

160
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,720
Fortunately, my fan is made of the Darksteel.

161
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,480
Otherwise...

162
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,400
Get away from me!

163
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
Bro Jiang, please help me mend this.

164
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,000
It's worn out here.

165
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,720
Make it up by yourself.

166
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,320
But how?

167
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,480
Miss Wen, come here.

168
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,720
Help me mend here quickly.

169
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,760
Miss Wen.

170
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,800
Miss Wen.

171
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't get too close.

172
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,240
Be careful that they will scratch you.

173
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,080
Madam...

174
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,880
Lan Zhan.

175
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
It worked.

176
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,040
Silent.

177
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
How can you outsmart me?

178
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,000
That was close.

179
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,120
Lan Zhan, luckily, you come in time.

180
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,360
Can you see who it is?

181
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,240
The comer just sent part of his or her cognition.

182
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
He or she didn't come in person.

183
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Good for him.

184
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,953
Villagers' spiritual cognition has been returned.

185
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,675
Let's go.

186
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,560
Wait for me.

187
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Useless!

188
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,360
Hello, Sir.

189
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Where are that three people just here?

190
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,470
What?

191
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,800
Where am I?

192
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,480
I let Clan Leader Wen down.

193
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,440
I almost hurt Qing.

194
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm good for nothing.

195
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Madam.

196
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,240
Get up please.

197
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
Get up, Madam.

198
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,160
Come on.

199
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,640
Qing.

200
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm of no use.

202
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
Madam.

203
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,760
Get up, everybody.

204
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,080
Madam.

205
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,560
Please don't say that.

206
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,400
I should say sorry to you.

207
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,520
You guys get out of here now.

208
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,600
You can go anywhere

209
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,760
except Qishan.

210
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,200
And don't come back here again.

211
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,240
Bro Jiang.

212
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,920
Why do they know Miss Wen?

213
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
And

214
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,400
why did she bring us to the graveyard?

215
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
How should I know?

216
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
Jiang Cheng.

217
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,160
Miss Wen.

218
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,560
Bro Wei, we are here.

219
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,160
Bro Wei.

220
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,600
I knew you could kill the Dire Owl.

221
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,440
You are really as sharp as a razor.

222
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,600
But

223
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,480
why are you here?

224
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,880
Miss Wen.

225
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:53,325
What on earth is this place?

226
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,750
This is where my clan was buried.

227
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,880
So that ancestral temple...

228
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,360
You're right.

229
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,080
That's Wen clan's ancestral temple.

230
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,240
We are a collateral branch of Wen clan of Qishan

231
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,600
specializing in medicine.

232
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,040
After leaving Qishan, we live here for generations.

233
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,760
But unexpectedly,

234
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,560
a disaster suddenly happened here.

235
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Father!

236
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,960
Qing, go!

237
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,070
As for the blood of our branch,

238
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,280
we are the last few.

239
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,560
Was it because Dancing Peri extracts the spiritual cognition?

240
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,480
Yes.

241
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,960
Since then

242
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,040
Wen Ning and I were brought up by His Excellency

243
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,040
back in Qishan.

244
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,760
But why the Dancing Peri hurt people suddenly?

245
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,520
I don't know.

246
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,080
Father.

247
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
I could have snatched up Wei Wuxian and his fellows.

248
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,440
It was because of the ignorance of Wen Qing.

249
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,280
She should dare to stop me secretly.

250
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,080
You fool!

251
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,720
Those who lived in Dafan Mountain are Wen Qing's people.

252
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,880
If you hadn't used

253
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,720
the power of Yin Iron I sealed in the Dire Owl

254
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
making them into puppets,

255
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,160
Wen Qing wouldn't have stopped you.

256
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,200
Besides, I asked you to help Xue Yang.

257
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,400
Why did you act on your own and stop them?

258
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,760
You are right, father.

259
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm sorry.

260
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,840
Go and find Yin Iron back.

261
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,920
This time you should make no mistake.

262
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,480
Yes, father.

263
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,440
I hope things won't go wrong any more.

264
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,680
If you stay with me,

265
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm sure you can remain unscathed.

266
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,560
Do not boast yourself.

267
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,520
If Miss Wen didn't come to Dafan Mountain,

268
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,920
can you still be alive?

269
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Staying with you

270
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,200
is really rotten luck.

271
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,080
Jiang Cheng.

272
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,130
Now that you think I bring you misfortune,

273
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,240
why did you follow me?

274
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,880
I...

275
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,240
Who says I'm following you.

276
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
In order to cross Dafan Mountain

277
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,760
there's only one road.

278
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,960
I'd like to say you are following me.

279
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,320
The barred rock chicken.

280
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,400
Look at that!

281
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,560
There!

282
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,680
How does it know I am hungry?

283
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,000
Bro Wei.

284
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,560
We two can catch it from front and back.

285
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,440
Let's go!

286
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,680
Jiang Cheng.

287
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
Help me block it from there.

288
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,480
I won't.

289
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,520
Quickly! Bro Nie is getting far.

290
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,320
Bro Nie.

291
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Miss Wen.

292
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
Twenty years ago,

293
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,680
didn't you know why Dancing Peri was out of control?

294
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,240
Where's Wei Wuxian?

295
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,680
He said he wanted to pee.

296
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,560
Maybe he is finding a toilet.

297
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,520
Second Childe Lan.

298
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,600
I have said it just now.

299
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,000
I was little at that time,

300
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,280
so I couldn't figure out.

301
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,520
Then did Miss Wen know

302
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,240
the missing part of Dancing Peri's heart?

303
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:17,365
Since we left Cloud Recesses,

304
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,000
Wen Chao followed us tightly.

305
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,720
Don't you know why?

306
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,760
Miss Wen.

307
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,920
If you didn't know anything,

308
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,560
why informed us of the danger suddenly?

309
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,240
Wei Wuxian.

310
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,400
You saved Ning

311
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,720
and I saved you.

312
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,680
So we are even.

313
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,680
As the motto of Wen family said, 'Every kindness should be returned.'

314
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,520
I don't know anything else.

315
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,040
Don't bother to ask me.

316
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,400
The missing part of Dancing Peri

317
00:29:58,275 --> 00:29:59,395
is the Yin Iron, right?

318
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,120
Miss Wen.

319
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,440
We are delibrately led to this place.

320
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,280
The beggar led us to Tiannv Temple when we entered the village.

321
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,440
Dancing Peri woke up.

322
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,400
But she aimed at Lan Zhan only.

323
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,880
Not us.

324
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,680
If her goal was not for the Yin Iron,

325
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,200
then the only sensible reason is that

326
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,400
she must have crushed on Lan Zhan.

327
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,080
Shut up.

328
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,520
Miss Wen.

329
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,960
The shape of Dafan Mountain is like a Buddha

330
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,200
with good geomantic omen.

331
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
The place should be full of spiritual power.

332
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,960
But along our way

333
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,080
it's weird to see the exhaustion of spiritual power.

334
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,640
Even if the Dancing Peri is the creation of great nature,

335
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,320
who wants to be humanoid,

336
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,640
she should absorb the power of others.

337
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,920
Centuries went by without incident.

338
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,040
Why in recent twenty years

339
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,760
did she suddenly start snatching human souls?

340
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,160
The only plausible reason

341
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
is the Yin Iron in her heart.

342
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,840
The power of the Yin Iron helped her to have human shape.

343
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,680
Just like the Water Ghost.

344
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
But ten years ago,

345
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,600
someone took away Yin Iron from her heart.

346
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,640
Because she couldn't absorb any power,

347
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,920
she started to snatch the human souls.

348
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Am I right?

349
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,240
And the man who took away the Yin Iron

350
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,200
was Wen Ruohan.

351
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,360
Miss Wen.

352
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,320
Twenty years ago, Wen Ruohan unsealed

353
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,280
and took out the Yin Iron,

354
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,400
which led to the death of your family members.

355
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,120
Now Wen Ruohan want to rob other Yin Iron.

356
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,040
There will be more people dead because of it.

357
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,880
Wei Wuxian.

358
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,800
Second Childe Lan.

359
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,520
I can't help you.

360
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,680
It's no use telling me this.

361
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,720
Miss Wen.

362
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,240
The four directions are guarded by Yin Iron.

363
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Now three of them have appeared.

364
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,880
Where's the last one?

365
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
Wen Ruohan sheltered me and my brother

366
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,760
and is kind to us.

367
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
As for others, I don't know

368
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
and don't want to know.

369
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,720
I can't help you.

370
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,520
Goodbye.

371
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Wait, Miss Wen!

372
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,960
Miss Wen.

373
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,160
Miss Wen.

374
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,360
Leaving alone was too dangrous for you.

375
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,360
You showed up in Dafan Mountain.

376
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,920
How can you explain to Wen clan this time?

377
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
Thanks for asking.

378
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,840
I'll be careful.

379
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,960
Why not stay with us this time?

380
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,800
Then you can make a plan.

381
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
I must go back.

382
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
My brother is still in the Nevernight.

383
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,440
But...

384
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,960
Childe Jiang, please don't persuade me.

385
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,560
I was in Dafan Mountain for saving my people,

386
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,280
not for saving others.

387
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,305
Wen Ruohan still needs my medical help.

388
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,040
He won't be hard on me.

389
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,840
Miss Wen.

390
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,240
Let her go.

391
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,720
She has her plans.

392
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,560
What's more,

393
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,670
I believe we could meet her soon.

394
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
Have a taste of Dichroa Red of Yueyang!

395
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,360
Childe.

396
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,360
Please try our Dichroa Red of Yueyang.

397
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,150
Childe, the taste is for free.

398
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,920
Have a taste of Dichroa Red of Yueyang!

399
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,960
Where are you going?

400
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
Find the gentry families residing here.

401
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,840
Why do you find them?

402
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,120
I'd say the way you handling affairs

403
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,200
is poor without my help.

404
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,440
Even if you find them,

405
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,080
you can't hear anything you want.

406
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,920
Then how should I inquire?

407
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,400
You should go to that place for sure.

408
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,360
You just wanna drink.

409
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,160
Wrong.

410
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,360
I, Wei Wuxian, always set private apart from public interests.

411
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,640
Think about that.

412
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,560
There are mixed guests here with so many voices speaking.

413
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,360
If nearby

414
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,120
something weird happened,

415
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,720
then they must have seen or heard them.

416
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,680
Your mouth

417
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,160
really has a gift of the gab.

418
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,600
Bro Wei, Bro Jiang.

419
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,920
What's up, Bro Nie.

420
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,080
Meng Yao hasn't arrived.

421
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,960
Let's find a place to have a rest.

422
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,120
Great!

423
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,040
Go, go, go.

424
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,760
Go, go, go.

425
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

426
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,480
Three bottles of liquor, please.

427
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,440
Are you crazy?

428
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
What a generous Childe!

429
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
Our Dichroa Red of Yueyang

430
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,680
is really strong.

431
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,520
Only people like Childe you can harness the power.

432
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,280
Please wait a moment.

433
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,480
Only by spending money can we pull something out of him.

434
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,480
Don't ask me for it if you run out of money.

435
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,240
The liquor is coming.

436
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,440
Childe, this is the liquor you ordered.

437
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,840
Come to the point.

438
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Waiter,

439
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
this is the first time for us to be in Yueyang.

440
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,200
Is anything of interest

441
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,800
in your Yueyang?

442
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,000
What kind of interesting things you wanna know?

443
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,600
What I mean for 'interesting'

444
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,120
is the eerier the better.

445
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,040
So is there anything bizarre?

446
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,080
Bizarre?

447
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
Bizzare things are

448
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,440
the ghost estate, grave or mutilation of the body

449
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,640
or something unusual

450
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,040
or any soul being snatched

451
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,240
and so on.

452
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,040
Childe, you really like strong tastes.

453
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,840
What is located in the southeast of Yueyang?

454
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
The southeast is

455
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,960
the house of Chang clan.

456
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,040
Childe, as you mentioned,

457
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
I remember a bizarre incident happened recently.

458
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,040
Say it.

459
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,360
If you walk along the path out of the city.

460
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,360
And a few miles more.

461
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,720
You can see a well-built house.

462
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,800
That is Chang clan's house.

463
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,080
Chang clan of Yueyang?

464
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,040
they are the cultivation clan settled in here.

465
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes, they are cultivators.

466
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,240
Although members of Chang clan are a few,

467
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,960
there are a dozen people lived in Yueyang.

468
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,040
But for unknown reasons,

469
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,960
they all disappeared recently.

470
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,440
Disappeared?

471
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,520
It should be.

472
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,120
But,

473
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,030
it should not be.

474
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,025
What do you mean?

475
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,880
It is because a dozen people of Chang clan

476
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,640
never appeared in Yueyang anymore.

477
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,040
But each night,

478
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,560
people can hear sounds from the house of Chang clan

479
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,870
like the heavy beats on the door.

480
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,760
Knockings?

481
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,560
Yes.

482
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,640
It has continued for ten days

483
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,240
with deafening knockings on the door.

484
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,000
There are cries and shrieks inside,

485
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,160
as if everyone

486
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,960
is locked in the house and couldn't get out.

487
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,480
Did anyone get inside to have a look?

488
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,680
They did.

489
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,920
But there's no one at daytime.

490
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
At night there are knockings.

491
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,960
Don't you think it's horrible?

492
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,400
Look,

493
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,840
It's almost evening.

494
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,080
Lan Zhan.

495
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,440
Lan Zhan, fix attention on heart.

496
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,160
Lan Zhan, fix attention!

497
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,760
It's Yin Iron.

498
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
What's up? Is anything going to happen?

499
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Lan Zhan!

500
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,480
Go.

501
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,080
To Chang clan.

502
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,920
I won't go.

503
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I'm here waiting for Meng Yao.

504
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,800
No knockings on the door.

505
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,000
Did the waiter fool us with nonsense?

506
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,400
Someone has used Yin Iron here.

507
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,120
Go.

508
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,360
The knocking.

509
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,040
Open!

510
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,920
Blood like stream.

511
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,440
The entire clan was murdered.

512
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,000
The bodies are blue.

513
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:57,465
The color of pupils changed.

514
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,880
There are red cracks on their necks.

515
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,040
Before they died,

516
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,680
all of them were made into puppets.
