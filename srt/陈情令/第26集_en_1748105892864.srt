1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thesem

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Jinlin is on the road to the capital.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't want you to go the wrong way.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you everywhere?

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Brother, Lord Han.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Please.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Please follow me.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you remember me?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Of course I do.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why don't you recognize me?

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We met before, right?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Su Min Shan and Mr. Su.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your swordsmanship is very good.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Last time I was thinking about it during the banquet.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Such a young talent.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a pity that we don't have a family.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now that we are here,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm so happy.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please, let's go this way.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Brother.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This way, please.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Su, please sit.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Brother.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ayao, you invited Su Shuo here?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
After the war,

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lord Su's family renovated the mansion.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Lord Su was also able to return to the Mo Lin family.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He was a good man.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He has been out for a few months.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Such talent.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's good that we know each other.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ayao.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't you know that Su Shuo is...

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm afraid you don't know.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Lord Su was originally a foreign disciple of Lan family.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
After the war, he was in Mo Lin.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Brother.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know about this.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's okay.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't know this.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't mind.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Gentlemen, let me serve you.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother Jiang, come here.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Come, Brother Jiang.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone,

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
this time, the mountain is full of wild animals.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The wild animals are considered the crime of the world.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Especially the Jiang family.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The wild animals are the hands of the people.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Congratulations, Lord Jiang.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What a pity.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't dare to talk about the Jiang family.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm willing to do what I can today.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm here to thank you all.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm here to thank you all.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you, Lord Lan.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You are indeed a great man.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lord Jiang, you are a hero.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You have a rich and rich country.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Come, drink.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Lord Lan, Lord Han.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I respect you all.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Zi Xun,

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Lord Ze Wu and Lord Han

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
are all from different tribes.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The rules of the world

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
are very important.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a very important matter.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sure you will be able to

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
discuss it with me.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sure you will be able to

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
discuss it with me.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sure you will be able to

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
discuss it with me.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Lord Lan, you are a very good man.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The rules of the world

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
are very important.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You should let them drink.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The Jin family and the Lan family

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
are all from the same family.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you two don't drink,

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you will be able to see me.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm very happy.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sure you will be able to do it.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't say it.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Lord Lan, we are not outsiders.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We are not outsiders.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't use the means of

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
dealing with outsiders to deal with me.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just say it. Drink.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Or don't drink.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
After Lord Lan and the others

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
meet at the city,

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm afraid that drinking will affect the meeting.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's not enough to drink two glasses of wine.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just drink eight big bowls of wine.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's the same.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's the same as meeting the heavens.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Good.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Lord Han,

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it's your turn now.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll drink for him.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Is that okay?

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Childe Wei.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Childe Wei.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Childe Wei.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When will you come?

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Just now.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Childe Wei, how did you come?

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Come, come, come. Please come up here.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have something important to ask Childe Jin.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't want to talk.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you have anything to say,

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
tell me after the party is over.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How long do you want to wait?

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Three or four hours.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Maybe

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
four or five hours is possible.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you want to wait,

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
tomorrow.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm afraid that I can't wait that long.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't wait.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I want to wait.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Childe Wei, what do you want to ask for?

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Are you in a hurry?

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not easy to get married.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't afford it.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Come, come, come.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's have another drink.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll just say it here.

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Childe Jin,

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
do you know a man named Wen Ning?

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You must know a man named Wen Ning.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A month ago,

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you were hunting a 8 billion

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
border guard

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to the place where

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the Qishan Wensheng's tribe was located.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Or it was near the place.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You took away a group of Wen family members.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The one who was in charge is him.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't know him.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't have the kind of

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
idle mind to keep on walking.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't mind talking more details.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can't catch that

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
border guard.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You came to check

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the Wen family members.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You forced them to drink

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Zhao Yingqi's wine and make you a living son.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They dare not.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They are all talking about you.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This person is Wen Ning.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
During the time of the Toto La La,

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the border guard escaped.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You took away

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the Wen family members.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They don't know what they are doing.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you need more details?

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They haven't returned to the capital.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In addition to asking you,

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I really don't know

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
who else can ask.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Wei Wuxian, what do you mean?

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You want me to kill you?

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you want to

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
kill me for a few moves?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You want me to kill you

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
or do you want to kill me?

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just hand it over.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wuxian, don't be too loud.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You are standing here.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
How dare you be so rude?

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You really think you are being rude

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and no one dares to hurt you?

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you want to turn the world around?

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you comparing yourself to the sky?

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I am being straightforward.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Your face is too thick.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not a big deal.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You young people are really angry.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But, Mr Wei,

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I am being fair.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You are making our Lanling

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the private banquet today.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's not right, is it?

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Chief Jin, I am sorry

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
for being rude.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
However, the few people

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
who took away Mr Jin

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
are now dead.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I am afraid it will be too late.

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There is one of them

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
who saved my life.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am really unable to stand it.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I hope that you will forgive me

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and forgive me in the future.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can't put it in the back.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Come, sit down.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I will talk to you slowly.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wei Wuxian, what are you doing?

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Chief Jin, you are being polite.

241
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's not done.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We can't delay this matter anymore.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Please solve it as soon as possible.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You are in a hurry. I am in a hurry.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Chief Jin, we still have some things

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to do.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Since you are here today,

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
we will take this opportunity

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to solve it together.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you mean?

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Mr Wei, I have mentioned

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
a few times with you.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't you remember?

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You used the same thing

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
in the battle of the shooting day.

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The Eagle Tiger Talisman?

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is there any problem?

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This thing is very similar to the Eagle Iron.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You used it once in the battle.

260
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It is powerful and harmful.

261
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And it has also

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
accumulated a lot of copper cultivation.

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Please tell me the important point.

264
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is the important point.

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Four Eagle Iron, three backpacks,

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
one missing.

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No matter how you train the Eagle Tiger Talisman,

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
no one can marry it

269
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
with its powerful.

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Such an important thing,

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you can't guarantee it

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
alone.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Chief Jin,

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
are you in the dark?

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay, let me ask you one more question.

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you think

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
there is no Qi Shan Wen's body?

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The Nan Ling Jin's body

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
should be replaced

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
by the one of Li Suo?

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't know.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will give you everything.

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will listen to you.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Look at the situation

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
of the Nan Ling Jin.

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I thought it was the King of Wen.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wei Wuxian, what are you talking about?

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Did I say something wrong?

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In the late night,

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I thought you were doing this

291
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to avenge your enemies.

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But now you are too late.

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are still alive.

294
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are not going to be able to fight.

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What's the difference between Qi Shan Wen and you?

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The Eagle Iron.

297
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Of course there is a difference.

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wen is a coward.

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This is their most important thing.

300
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We are just going to give them a tooth to chew.

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let them keep their own evil power.

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What's wrong with us?

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Wen Qing and Wen Ning are both brothers.

304
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They have never fought with each other.

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I am not the one.

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You still want to play with Lian?

307
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
People can kill.

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Do they have any other reason?

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I am sorry.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I killed too little.

311
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Even the innocent people

312
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
have to kill me.

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If I kill you today,

314
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
will I be the first?

315
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You...

316
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wei Wuxian.

317
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Wei Ying.

318
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't come here.

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Everything is going to be fine.

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Wei Wuxian.

321
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Is President Jiang still here?

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Is he too selfish?

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wei Wuxian.

324
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wei Wuxian.

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Wei Wuxian.

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Who can stop him?

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Who dares to stop him?

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wei Ying.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Put down the gun.

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Xin Zixun.

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Wei Wuxian.

332
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think you all know

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
that I am not very patient.

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I have spent so much time with you here.

335
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I only have three lives for you.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Three...

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Two.

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You are done.

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Isn't it just a few gentle moves?

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You want to take the medicine?

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't want to take it.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't want to take it.

343
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't want to take it.

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to take it.

345
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't want to take it.

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't want to mess with you.

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You go find it yourself.

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Look at you.

349
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You should have said it earlier.

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wei Ying.

351
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I found it.

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's go.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why don't you take a break first?

354
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I will go by myself.

355
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I promise you.

356
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will save it for you.

357
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No.

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No.

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I have to go.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I must go.

361
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How are you going now?

362
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Eat something.

363
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Don't be too tired.

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I promise you.

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you finish this cake,

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I will take you there.

367
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Where are An Ning?

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Qiun Qi.

369
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I knew it.

370
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I shouldn't have left her.

371
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But I had no choice.

372
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They sent me to another city.

373
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
When I came back,

374
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
An Ning and them were gone.

375
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I knew it.

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I shouldn't have left her alone.

377
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You have to believe her.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
She can do it.

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You should die.

380
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No.

381
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Father, please calm down.

382
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Father.

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ayao.

384
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you okay?

385
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I am fine.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Erge, sit down.

387
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You should go back and change.

388
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't leave.

389
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Childe Wei is too impulsive.

390
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
How can he say that in front of so many people?

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He is right.

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Am I wrong?

393
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes, you are right.

394
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's because you are right.

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So you can't be the father.

396
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Childe Wei is right now.

397
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But he has changed.

398
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Go.

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Go.

400
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He is a warm-hearted man.

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He is so impulsive.

402
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He is not even a talkative man.

403
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Who is he?

404
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Let's go.

405
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Uncle, let's go.

406
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Uncle.

407
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Uncle.

408
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Uncle.

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Uncle.

410
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Uncle.

411
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Where is Ning?

412
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Where is Ning?

413
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Where is Ning?

414
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Miss.

415
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Where are you from?

416
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I am looking for someone.

417
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't care if you are looking for someone.

418
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's go.

419
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Ning.

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Ning.

421
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Ning.

422
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Ning.

423
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Is she Ning?

424
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Is she Ning?

425
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is she Ning?

426
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Ning.

427
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Ning.

428
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Is she Ning?

429
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Is she?

430
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Ning.

431
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Ning.

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Is she Ning?

433
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,520
How do you think it's fair?

434
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
Help me with this!

435
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Want to know if there are any Cavalry Jamיכes.

436
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,960
There's someone talking to me.

437
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Did you see him?

438
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
All the soldiers here are from Wen family.

439
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
There's a new one every day.

440
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
It's all here.

441
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
I knew it.

442
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
He must be here.

443
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
There's someone coming here to repair the house.

444
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I think he ran away.

445
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
He won't run away.

446
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm afraid they're all here.

447
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Ning won't run away.

448
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
You mean

449
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
everyone is here?

450
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
They're all here.

451
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
They're all here?

452
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Fine.

453
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
I believe that

454
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
everyone here is alive.

455
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
What about the others?

456
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
I don't know.

457
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
I mean

459
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
the family's body

460
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
is all in the cave.

461
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
We're innocent.

462
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
It's none of our business.

463
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Take us there.

464
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
There's someone here.

465
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
He's right in front of us.

466
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
No.

467
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Ning.

468
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Ning.

469
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Ning.

470
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Ning.

471
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Ning.

472
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Ning.

473
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Ning.

474
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Ning.

475
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Ning.

476
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Ning.

477
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Ning.

478
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Ning.

479
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Ning.

480
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Ning.

481
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Ning.

482
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Ning.

483
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Ning.

484
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Ning.

485
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
An Ning!

486
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
How is it? Did you find him?

487
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,960
How is he?

488
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,760
After Mr. Jin left, he was left for several days.

489
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,960
Even if he didn't die, he should be dead now.

490
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,760
What are you talking about?

491
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,160
When Wei Wuxian and his wife get together,

492
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,360
hurry and leave!

493
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,560
But wait! Jin Mu told me that

494
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,960
these are all the things for love.

495
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,360
We must take good care of them.

496
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,560
If we do, what if we get drunk?

497
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,360
Is life important now or are those people important?

498
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,760
I think we should just kill these people.

499
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,360
This way, they won't tell us what we did.

500
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,360
What are you doing?

501
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Kill them!

502
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Kill them!

503
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Kill them!

504
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Kill them!

505
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Kill them!

506
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Kill them!

507
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Kill them!

508
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,360
You put Zhao Yingqi on their body

509
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,360
for the sake of making them commit a crime?

510
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Or is it just a way to kill them?

511
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Who killed them?

512
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Mr. Wei, don't talk nonsense!

513
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
No one dares to kill them here!

514
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
They did something wrong!

515
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
They were killed by the soldiers.

516
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
No one dares to kill them.

517
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Right!

518
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Don't act like this!

519
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Don't do anything stupid!

520
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Oh, I see.

521
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Because of the Wen family,

522
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,360
because they are not human beings.

523
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,360
So, no one dares to kill them here.

524
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,360
That's not what I meant.

525
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Right?

526
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Or do you really think

527
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
I won't tell you?

528
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Don't let Jiang Shi and Lai Ling get into trouble!

529
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Mr. Wei, you can't do this!

530
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,360
You have no courage.

531
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Are you threatening me?

532
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
No, no, no, no!

533
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
No!

534
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Please spare me!

535
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Please spare me!

536
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Since you can't admit it,

537
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,360
let him be the one to kill himself.

538
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Please spare me!

539
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Please spare me!

540
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Please spare me!

541
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Please spare me!

542
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Please spare me!

543
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
An Ning!

544
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
No!

545
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
How could this happen?

546
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
How could Wen Ning not be controlled?

547
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
No!

548
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Wen Ning!

549
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,360
No!

550
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
No!

551
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
No!

552
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Stop!

553
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
An Ning didn't die!

554
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,360
She was just taken away by the spirit!

555
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Wen Ning!

556
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Wen Ning!

557
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Wen Qiong Lin!

558
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Wen Ning!

559
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Wen Ning!

560
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
Wen Ning!

561
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
What's wrong?

562
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Someone's coming to save me!

563
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
I have to kill him!

564
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Wen Ning!

565
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Miss Tianqin?

566
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Who are you?

567
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
What's wrong with you?

568
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Nothing.

569
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Those are Wen Ning's men's affairs.

570
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Stop!

571
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
What's going on?

572
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
