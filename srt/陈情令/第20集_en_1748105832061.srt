00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,100
Zhu Jia is a good man.

152
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
But I never heard anyone do this.

153
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900

158
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,500
Get up.

159
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,700
Master Jiang.

160
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,980
I didn't expect that we'd meet again.

161
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
What happened to them?

162
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,940
He...

163
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,700
Where is he?

164
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
It's not long ago.

165
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,580
Lan Wangji and I

166
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,660

167
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,900
Yes.

168
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,100
You were all killed at that time.

169
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,380
So,

170
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,340
you didn't know where he was.

171
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,420
I'm well tipsy now.

172
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,700
Master,

173
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,700
I don't know if you've got used to this.

174
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,740
But what happened at the world

175
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,940
has caused the British imagination

176
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,220
to disember you

177
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,620

180
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Ning.

182
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Ning took them away.

183
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
And still in Ji Mountain.

184
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Wen Qing.

185
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
I can...

188
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100

189
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
How can you do that?

190
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
I...

191
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
But I'm still a Wen clan.

192
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I have a brother.

193
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
And I need to take care of my family.

194
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
You can keep me alone.

195
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
You can keep my whole family alive.

196
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Chief Jiang.

197
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Thank you for your help.

198
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
We can leave

199
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
alone.

200
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Miss Wen.

201
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,100
If anything happens to Wen Qing,

202
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
I will help you again.

203
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Go.

204
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Qi Mountain.

205
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
You mean

206
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Wen Zhu Liu took Wen Chang to escape?

207
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
No.

208
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
I don't know.

209
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I don't know.

210
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I don't know.

211
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
I don't know.

212
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I don't know.

213
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
I don't know.

214
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
I don't know.

215
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I don't know.

216
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
I don't know.

217
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Wen Zhu Liu took Wen Chang to escape.

218
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Since that,

219
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
we can leave this check room alone.

220
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
We can leave it here.

221
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
We can leave it here.

222
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
We can leave it here.

223
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Okay.

224
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Wen Zhu Liu took Wen Chang to escape.

225
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
I don't know.

226
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
I don't know.

227
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
I don't know.

228
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
I don't know.

229
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
I don't know.

230
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
I don't know.

231
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I don't know.

232
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
I don't know.

233
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I don't know.

234
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
I don't know.

235
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
I don't know.

236
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I don't know.

237
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I don't know.

238
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I don't know.

239
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I don't know.

240
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Look at this person's clothes.

241
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
The price should be low.

242
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Is that person's body?

243
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
It's weird.

244
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
It's a person's body.

245
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
We've been chasing Wen Chang.

246
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
But he's faster than us.

247
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Who is he?

248
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
He's a good person.

249
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
We're careful.

250
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Blood?

251
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Is there blood in this world?

252
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
As long as the target is with us,

253
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
it's not the enemy.

254
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Let's go.

255
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Why do you still have to hurry?

256
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Chief.

257
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
We've got news.

258
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Someone found the trace of Wen Chu

259
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
near the battle in Yunmeng.

260
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Wen Chang won't go back to Qishan.

261
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
Why did he go to Yunmeng?

262
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Let's go.

263
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Don't be so reckless.

264
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Wen Chang is not here.

265
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Let's go inside first.

266
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Don't run!

267
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Don't run.

268
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Don't run.

269
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Don't run.

270
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,460
that we can protect you.

271
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,060
My life...

272
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,680
My wife?

273
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,100
It's ok.

274
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,700
I will check on you now.

275
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,180
If you don't mind,

276
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,300
just give them my cigarette.

277
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,860
Cooking...

278
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
Did you call for a artistic team?

279
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,820
You think he can't find us without lighting?

280
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,820
Liu Chuliao, you said we ran so far and so long.

281
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
They should be able to find us.

282
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Maybe.

283
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
What do you mean maybe?

284
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
You didn't run, you should take me away.

285
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Don't move.

286
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,820
You need medicine, or you'll die.

287
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Don't move.

288
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Look at me.

289
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Look at me.

290
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Don't cry, don't cry.

291
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,820
Tears will make your wound better.

292
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
Your wound will hurt more.

293
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Do you understand?

294
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Don't cry.

295
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
Don't cry.

296
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,820
Di Zi.

297
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Di Zi.

298
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
Di Zi.

299
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Is it Di Zi?

300
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
No, it's Feng Sheng.

301
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
Feng Sheng?

302
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
No.

303
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Come, eat.

304
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
After eating, you can't go anywhere.

305
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
I'm not going.

306
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
I want to find my father.

307
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,820
When are we going to find my father?

308
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,820
There are two days left to find this speed.

309
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
Two days.

310
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Two days.

311
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Look at me.

312
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
You still want me to wait for two days.

313
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
What's the point of my father's life?

314
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,820
You useless thing, useless.

315
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
You're going to kill him now.

316
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
You're useless.

317
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
No, no, no, no.

318
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm wrong.

319
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
I'm wrong.

320
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
I'm wrong.

321
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
You're wrong.

322
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
I'm not your brother.

323
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
I'm your father's son.

324
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
From now on, you're my brother.

325
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,820
No need.

326
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
No.

327
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
Hurry.

328
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,820
From now on, you still think it's useful?

329
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
Wen Zhu Liu.

330
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,820
Don't you really think that you can hold on to him

331
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
under my control?

332
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
You're going to die.

333
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,820
It's a good thing that you're a good dog.

334
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,820
I can't let you go.

335
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
You're kidding me.

336
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Why do you have to help others

337
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,820
to pay for your sins?

338
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
I'm sorry.

339
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
I'm sorry.

340
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
No.

342
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
No.

343
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,820
No.

344
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
Your sword.

345
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,820
Thank you.

346
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
Thank you.

347
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
You brat.

348
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Where have you been these three months?

349
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,820
It's hard to explain.

350
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
It's hard to explain.

351
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Didn't you say that

352
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,820
the broken town in the mountains would be together?

353
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
I've waited for you for five days.

354
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
I haven't seen your ghost shadow.

355
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,820
I'm afraid of the emergency these three months.

356
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
A few days ago,

357
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
I and Mr. Lan Er

358
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,820
stole the nightclub's painting.

359
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,820
They said you were thrown into the mess.

360
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
If I were thrown into the mess,

361
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,820
I would be in trouble.

362
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,820
If I were thrown into the mess,

363
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,820
I would be alive.

364
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,820
The person who was thrown in

365
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,820
didn't come out alive.

366
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Where did they catch you?

367
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
Yiling or Buye Tiancheng?

368
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,820
And how did you come out?

369
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,820
How did you become like this?

370
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Really?

371
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,820
Did I change?

372
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,820
Not really.

373
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,820
But where have you been these three months?

374
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
A few days ago,

375
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
I and Mr. Lan Er

376
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,820
stole the nightclub's painting.

377
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
They stole the painting.

378
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,820
I didn't expect it to be you.

379
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,820
You also changed the fortune.

380
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
If I say

381
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,820
I entered a cave in the escape route,

382
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
there was a secret place

383
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,820
that was left by an outsider.

384
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820
After I left,

385
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
I could kill four people.

386
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Do you believe it?

387
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Of course.

388
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
There are many people watching the painting.

389
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
There are no so many people.

390
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,820
The secret place is a secret place.

391
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Look,

392
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,820
you don't believe me.

393
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,820
I'll tell you later.

394
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
It's okay.

395
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
We'll talk about it later.

396
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
It's good that you're back.

397
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
You're back early.

398
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,820
I just came out.

399
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
I heard

400
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,820
you and Senior Sister are all fine.

401
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,820
You're busy with Chongjian and Jiang's world.

402
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,820
You're busy with the war.

403
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Thank you for these three months.

404
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
Take your sword.

405
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
I'll wait for you.

406
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
I'll wait for you.

407
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,820
I'll wait for you.

408
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
I'll wait for you.

409
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,820
I don't want to take two swords all day.

410
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,820
People ask me every day.

411
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Wei Ying.

412
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Second Young Master Lan.

413
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,820
No.

414
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,820
It should be Han Guang Jun.

415
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,820
You're the one who chased after the Wen clan, right?

416
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Yes.

417
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,820
You changed the talismans of Yiling.

418
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,820
What method did you use to kill her?

419
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,820
Second Young Master Lan, what do you mean?

420
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,820
Why did you go to the Sword Island

421
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
to repair the land?

422
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,820
Answer me.

423
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
If I don't answer,

424
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
what will happen?

425
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
Lan Zhan.

426
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
We just met again.

427
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
You're so heartless and guilty.

428
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,820
It's not good.

429
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,820
Since the start of the Qishan Xuanwu,

430
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,820
the wine of the month,

431
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,820
even if you don't remember the meaning of the same robe,

432
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
you shouldn't be so determined.

433
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
You should go back to the Sword Island

434
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
and answer me.

435
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,820
I said you don't believe me.

436
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,820
You can't tell me the exact time and time.

437
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,820
Then go back to the Qusu Island

438
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
and tell me the truth.

439
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Qusu Island?

440
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,820
You mean the place with more than 3,000 rules?

441
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,820
I don't want to go there.

442
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,820
I prefer Yunmeng.

443
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
Wei Ying, don't make fun of me.

444
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,820
Second Young Master Lan.

445
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Second Young Master Lan.

446
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,820
Lan Zhan.

447
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,820
What are you doing?

448
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Wei Ying,

449
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,820
the Qusu Island is a good place to repair the land.

450
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,820
It will pay the price.

451
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,820
I've never been here before.

452
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,820
I'm more concerned about the land.

453
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,820
The land?

454
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Second Young Master Lan.

455
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm not going to take someone else's land.

456
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,820
How can I call it a Qusu Island?

457
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
I'm using the talisman.

458
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,820
I'm using the silver and silver.

459
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,820
Is this a Qusu Island?

460
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Even if this is a Qusu Island,

461
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,820
whether it's damaged or not,

462
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I know it best.

463
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,820
As for the confidence,

464
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
I'm the master of the heart.

465
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
I have the right to say it.

466
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,820
There are some things

467
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,820
that you can't control.

468
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
How can I know

469
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,820
how confident I am?

470
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820
How can others know

471
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,820
what's going on with others?

472
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Wei Wuxian.

473
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,820
Lan Wangji.

474
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,820
You must have something to do with me at this time.

475
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,820
Who do you think you are?

476
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Who do you think you are?

477
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,820
Do you really think I won't resist?

478
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,820
Second Young Master Lan.

479
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,820
It's not the time for the chaos.

480
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,820
It's the time for the war.

481
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Why are you so upset about

482
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,820
the Qusu Island?

483
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,820
If you're not being polite,

484
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,820
even if you want to pursue it,

485
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,820
you can't fight against the Qusu Island.

486
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,820
You won't fight against anyone.

487
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Wen Zhuliu.

488
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Master Jia Cheng.

489
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,820
Second Young Master Lan.

490
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,820
I'm sorry.

491
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,820
I'm sorry.

492
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Forgive me.

494
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,820
I'm sorry.

495
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,820
Second Young Master Lan.

496
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,820
This is our family business in the Yunmeng River.

497
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,820
Please go back.

498
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,820
Don't hurt me.

499
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,820
Don't hurt me.

500
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,820
Lan Wangji.

501
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,820
You must have something to do with me at this time.

502
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Who do you think you are?

503
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Who do you think you are?

504
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,820
I'm sorry.

505
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Uncle Jiang said you're a married woman.

506
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,820
You don't need to take care of me and the world.

507
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
I did the right thing.

508
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Don't worry.

509
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,420
What are you talking about?

510
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,820
Nothing.

511
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,020
How is it?

512
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,220
Do you want to go to Qinghe with me?

513
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,620
To participate in the battle of the Shou'er?

514
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,620
Are you kidding me?

515
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,220
Why don't you let me come back?

516
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,820
Moreover,

517
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,820
Senior sister is still in Qinghe.

518
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,220
You always say that.

519
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,820
By the way,

520
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,420
how is Senior sister?

521
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,220
Are you still angry with me?

522
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,420
You can go and see for yourself.

523
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,820
Come.

524
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,420
Slowly.

525
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,020
Slowly.

526
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,620
Don't be angry.

527
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,620
Don't be angry.

528
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,220
Slowly.

529
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,220
Be careful.

530
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,820
Come.

531
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,620
Hold on.

532
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
Be careful.

533
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,220
Senior sister.

534
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:41,420
Thank you.

535
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
The rain is falling.

536
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,420
The rain is falling.

537
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
The rain is falling.

538
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
The rain is falling.

539
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
The rain is falling.

540
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,420
The rain is falling.

541
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,420
The rain is falling.

542
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
The rain is falling.

543
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,420
The rain is falling.

544
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
The rain is falling.

545
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,420
The rain is falling.

546
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,420
The rain is falling.

547
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,420
The rain is falling.

548
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
The rain is falling.

549
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
The rain is falling.

550
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
The rain is falling.

551
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
The rain is falling.

552
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
The rain is falling.

553
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
The rain is falling.

554
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,420
The rain is falling.

555
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
The rain is falling.

556
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
The rain is falling.

557
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
The rain is falling.

558
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
The rain is falling.

559
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,420
The rain is falling.

560
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
The rain is falling.

561
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
The rain is falling.

562
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,420
The rain is falling.

563
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
The rain is falling.

564
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
The rain is falling.

565
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
The rain is falling.

566
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
The rain is falling.

567
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
The rain is falling.

568
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
The rain is falling.

569
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,420
The rain is falling.

570
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
