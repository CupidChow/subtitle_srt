1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fifth one is the first one.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fifth one is the first one.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fifth one is the first one.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Little bird.

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
Another Health Plant.

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,900
It's devoured our lives!

35
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,100
Help! Thanks for ploying!

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,060
He got me!

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey!

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Watch out!

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No!

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm not dead.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You forgot me.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You lost.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Look at your pain.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Lan Zhan.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's your good plan?

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go out.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Go out.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wait!

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Lan Zhan.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wei Xiong.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are we too reckless to go out?

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Should we discuss the situation?

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Shouldn't we die?

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wei Xiong.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't want to die.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't want to die.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Listen to me.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Nian Xiong.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We'll go out later.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You must follow me.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't let go of your hand.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't let go of your hand.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you understand?

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go.

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Go.

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go.

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go.

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Stop.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Go.

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Stop.

72
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What's wrong with him?

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know.

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Wei Wuxian.

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Please forgive me.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you accept the punishment?

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Jiang Cheng.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If you can't get out,

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Lan Zhan will be released.

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Jiang Cheng.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why are you here?

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't come without you.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're so selfish.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Without your ear,

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm selfish.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm selfish.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm not stupid.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You should have said

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that you're not good at keeping a self-adapted picture.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you know how many I have?

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm worried about you.

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Jiang Xiu.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You can forget about Wei Wuxian.

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why are you making me and Wang Ji brothers?

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We are...

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm in the middle of the night.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know who's in the middle of the night.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Alright, Jiang Cheng.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm the one who's coming out with Lan Zhan.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You have to blame him.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can't blame him.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I haven't finished you.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You should have said something for him.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't know what you're going to do.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But you've already seen the risk.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If it weren't for Miss Wen...

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Miss Wen?

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Wen Qing is here too.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh no.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How long has this young man been in the room?

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Miss Wen must have been in danger.

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where is she?

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you two here together?

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Miss Wen.

125
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Miss Wen again?

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is Wen Chao also around?

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why is he trying to harm us?

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Miss Wen, are you alright?

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. Jiang.

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I told you to save him.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Miss Wen.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why are you here?

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They're here again.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Miss Wen.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You guys should leave.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's go together.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can't leave.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mr. Jiang, you promised me.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You can come here and listen to me.

140
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then you take them away.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Miss Wen, you can't save them.

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They'll be here in no time.

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you know how to save them?

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Isn't this the five-day wedding ceremony?

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can we still save them?

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Wen Qing.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't care why you're here.

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But we're all trapped here.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We have to work together to get out.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If you know how to make them recover,

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I hope you can tell me now.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let me tell you.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Their operation is not strong enough.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wen Chao just used the power of the Yin Iron

156
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that Wen Ruohan used to control them.

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you really want to help them,

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
kill the birds first.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You should have told me earlier.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Wei Ying, set up the Jin Si Town and protect them.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wei Wuxian, what are you doing?

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Wei Ying, you can't hold on for long.

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're hurting us.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Jiang Cheng, you're not good at kung fu.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Protect them.

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You...

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you can't stand it,

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll hide them in the house.

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Aren't you the best one?

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You must protect them.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I've wanted to kill that bird long ago.

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Wait for us to come back.

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Wait for us.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Wei Wuxian.

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You bastard.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're so stupid.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You bastard.

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wen Cheng.

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wen Cheng.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Wen Cheng.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Lan Zhan, where are you?

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Lan Zhan.

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Lan Zhan, where are you?

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Lan Zhan.

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Lan Zhan.

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What... what's going on?

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Listen.

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Lan Zhan.

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What's going on?

190
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm even more angry.

191
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Lan Zhan.

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Lan Zhan, where are you?

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's over.

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Did Lan Zhan get caught by the bird?

195
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm next to you.

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're talking nonsense.

197
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's the bird's creation.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's a secret.

199
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's okay.

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's see if we can get rid of them.

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The sound of the bell is not only making people lose their minds,

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
but also making them feel bad.

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We can't concentrate on it at all.

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, no.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why are you okay?

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The more the bell rings, the more the heart beats.

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The more it interferes.

208
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, I see.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I see.

210
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I see.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I see.

212
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, I see.

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're so smart.

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Lan Zhan.

215
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Are you okay?

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm fine.

217
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Did you see anyone?

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No.

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Wei Ying.

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Wei Ying.

221
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Close the door.

222
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's Li Fu.

223
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Wei Ying.

224
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why hasn't Wei Yongxian come back yet?

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Wei Ying.

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Luckily, I got rid of the bell.

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
How about this?

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Go, go.

229
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Brother Jiang, please help me get rid of the bell.

230
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll get rid of it myself.

231
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What?

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Miss Wen, hurry up.

233
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Help me get rid of the bell.

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Miss Wen.

235
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Miss Wen, don't close the door.

236
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Be careful, they'll catch you.

237
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's going on?

238
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, no.

239
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Lan Zhan, you're so cunning.

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Jin Sheng.

241
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,240
The

242
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
The

The

The

245

The

246
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
The

247
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
The

248
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
The

249
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
The

250
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
The

251
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
The

252
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
The

253
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
The

254
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
The

255
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
The

256
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
The

257
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
The

258
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
The

259
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
The

260
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
The

261
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
The

262
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
The

263
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
The

264
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
The

265
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
The

266
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
The

The

The

269
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
The

270
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
The

271
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,680
The

272
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,720
The

273
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
The

274
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
The

275
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
The

276
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,180
The

277
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,680
The

278
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,020
The

279
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
The

280
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
The

281
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,120
Lianxian, stop staring at me...

282
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,820
Lianxian, what are you doing?

283
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,300
Let me face you.

284
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,920
Stop!

285
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,420
My money's in this app.

286
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,200
I can afford it.

287
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,340
It's right here.

288
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,520
Add it.

289
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,000
Cheap she is!

290
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,280
hasn't gotten the soul?

291
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
let's go

292
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,360
Wait!

293
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,320
Doct�

294
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
What's wrong?

295
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
What's wrong?

296
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
What's wrong?

297
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
What's wrong?

298
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
What's wrong?

299
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
What's wrong?

300
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
What's wrong?

301
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
What's wrong?

302
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
What's wrong?

303
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Don't worry.

304
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
I'm fine.

305
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
I'll go get you some water.

306
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Please.

307
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Let's go.

308
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm so tired.

309
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I'm so tired.

310
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I don't want to move.

311
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Xiang, where are the three of you?

312
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
What?

313
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Where am I?

314
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm here.

315
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Can you still walk?

316
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm fine.

317
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm fine.

318
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm fine.

319
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm fine.

320
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I'll get you some water.

321
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm fine.

322
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
I'm the owner of the house.

323
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
I almost hurt Miss Qin.

324
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I always did it.

325
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
It's useless.

326
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Get up.

327
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Get up.

328
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Get up.

329
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Yes.

330
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Miss Qin.

331
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm sorry.

332
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
It's useless.

333
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Granny.

334
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Get up.

335
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Granny.

336
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Don't say that.

337
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
You should leave.

339
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Go anywhere.

340
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Don't go to Qi Shan.

341
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Xiang, how did they know Miss Wen?

342
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,520
And why did she bring us here?

343
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
How did I know?

344
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Xiang Cheng.

345
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Miss Wen.

346
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Wei, we're here.

347
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Wei, I knew you could do it.

348
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
You're so filial.

349
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,520
But why are you here?

350
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Miss Wen.

351
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
What is this place?

352
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,520
This is the place where I bought the bones of the people.

353
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,520
So the temple?

354
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Yes.

355
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
That's the temple of Miss Wen.

356
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,520
We're the people of Qi Shan who sold the bones of the people.

357
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,520
We'll take the people with us after we leave Qi Shan.

358
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,520
But I didn't expect something bad would happen here.

359
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Go.

360
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Hurry up.

361
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Hurry up.

362
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,520
We're the only ones left in the world.

363
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Because the Five Heavenly Girls stole the spiritual food?

364
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Yes.

365
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,520
From then on, Wen Ning and I were adopted by the Immortal Poison.

366
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
We went back to Qi Shan.

367
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,520
But why did the Five Heavenly Girls suddenly hurt people?

368
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
I don't know.

369
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
I don't know.

370
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Father.

371
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I could have captured Wei Wuxing and the King.

372
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
But Wen Qing is such a coward.

373
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
How dare he stop me?

374
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
You idiot.

375
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
The people of Da Fan Mountain are all Wen Qing's people.

376
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,520
If you hadn't sealed the seal on Xiao Niao's body

377
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
and made them into a puppet,

378
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Wen Qing would have been against you.

379
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
You are right.

380
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,320
I asked you to help Xue Yang.

381
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,520
Who told you to take the lead?

382
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,320
Father, I will do what you said.

383
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,120
Go and get the silver iron.

384
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,120
This time, we can't let it go.

385
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,720
Yes, father.

386
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,520
But don't make any mistakes.

387
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,120
You can't even have a hair cut with me.

388
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,920
Stop talking nonsense.

389
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,720
If Miss Wen didn't come to save you,

390
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,120
wouldn't you be in trouble?

391
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,320
It's been eight times for me to be with you.

392
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Jiang Cheng, you think you can't be with me?

393
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,520
Why do you have to follow me?

394
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,120
I...

395
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,520
Who told you I followed you?

396
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
You want to cross the big mountain,

397
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,320
there is only one way.

398
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,320
I said you followed me.

399
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Dragon flower chicken.

400
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Look at you.

401
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,320
What's the matter?

402
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,720
I'm not hungry.

403
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,920
I'm not hungry.

404
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,720
How did he know I'm hungry?

405
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,720
Wei, let's go back and feed him.

406
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,720
Let's go.

407
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,720
Jiang Cheng, block me from that side.

408
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm not going.

409
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Hurry up.

410
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,520
Brother Nie is far away.

411
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Brother Nie.

412
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,720
Miss Wen,

413
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,520
you really don't know why the Five-day Goddess is missing 20 years ago.

414
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Where are you going?

415
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,920
I have to go back soon.

416
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
And Aem divorcing?

417
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Master,

418
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,520
he felt.." ocean breeze."

419
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,720
Aem?

420
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,320
About to miss me again?

421
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,720
Ma Xia shares a cold gun to clear thelevel of compassion.

422
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,900
Come on, come on.

423
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,940
Go quickly.

424
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,700
It looked like he was worrying about the road?

425
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,380
You knew where my territory is.

426
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,380
That heut's farm is all on the same track.

427
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,140
Father, you need to get multiple episódioarian viewers.

428
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,740
Don't want to waste your time.

429
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,820
You really thought about it.

430
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Are you sure

431
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,380
that the land was the abused one?

432
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,900
Why did it appear after him?

433
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,980
He is the evil Конcho,

434
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,480
if all the strip farmers

435
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,440
Miss Wen.

437
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,440
If you really don't know anything,

438
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,240
why did you suddenly come to report the letter to us?

439
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,880
Wei Wuxian.

440
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,920
You saved Ning.

441
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
I saved you.

442
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,200
It's a fair battle between us.

443
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,320
Wen Jia and Xia Xun have a good news.

444
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
I don't know anything else.

445
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,160
You don't have to ask me.

446
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,320
The things that Five-Sister-In-Law's heart lacks

447
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,360
are the Yin Iron.

448
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,240
Miss Wen.

449
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,480
We were attracted to this place by friendship.

450
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,000
We were just in the village.

451
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,760
We were taken by the beggar's wife

452
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
and the Yin Iron.

453
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,440
Five-Sister-In-Law woke up.

454
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,400
But she only caught Lan Zhan.

455
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,880
She didn't catch us.

456
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,520
If it wasn't for the Yin Iron,

457
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
then there's only one reason

458
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,120
for her to say it.

459
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
She must have seen Lan Zhan.

460
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,040
Shut up.

461
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,480
Miss Wen.

462
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,920
The mountain is full of Buddha.

463
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
The water is great.

464
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,720
According to the law,

465
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,720
it should be the perfect place for spiritual power.

466
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,880
But we've come all the way here.

467
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Seeing the spiritual power being crushed

468
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
is very strange.

469
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,640
Five-Sister-In-Law

470
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,600
even if it's the natural life,

471
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,240
it needs to be used as a human form

472
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
to absorb the external power.

473
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,880
It's been a long time.

474
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,960
Why did she suddenly turn to the past

475
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,720
in the last 20 years

476
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,640
and start to absorb the spiritual power of people?

477
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,080
The only reason she said it was clear

478
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
is the Yin Iron

479
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,160
she was in her heart.

480
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,920
The Yin Iron

481
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,680
is a form of human form.

482
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,520
It's like water.

483
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,680
Ten years ago,

484
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,200
someone took away the Yin Iron

485
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,440
from her heart.

486
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,480
She couldn't absorb the spiritual power

487
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,680
and turned to the spiritual power of the absorbed person.

488
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,480
Am I right?

489
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,680
Someone took away the Yin Iron

490
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,880
because it was Wen Ruohan.

491
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,400
I'm sorry.

492
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,440
Miss Wen.

493
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,080
Twenty years ago,

494
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,440
Wen Ruohan opened a seal

495
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,400
and removed the Yin Iron.

496
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,440
This made your family suffer.

497
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,840
Now Wen Ruohan

498
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,120
has taken away the other Yin Iron.

499
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,920
That's why the people who died

500
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,000
will suffer more.

501
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,920
Wei Wuxian.

502
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,720
Mr. Lao.

503
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,560
I can't help you.

504
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,680
It's useless for you to say this to me.

505
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,720
Miss Wen.

506
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,080
Yin Iron is at the four directions.

507
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
Now there are three pieces of the seal.

508
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,720
Where is the last piece?

509
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,280
Wen Ruohan took away my brother

510
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,720
and is kind to us.

511
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I don't know anything else.

512
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,760
I don't want to know.

513
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,520
Wen Qin can't help you.

514
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,520
I'll take my leave.

515
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,840
Wait.

516
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,800
Miss Wen.

517
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
Miss Wen.

518
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,480
You went to visit Wen now.

519
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,480
You were in the fields.

520
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
I don't need it.

521
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,280
Thank you for your concern.

522
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,040
I'll be careful.

523
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,120
Why don't we

524
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,000
take the same route this time?

525
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,120
I have to go back.

526
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,920
My brother is still in the night.

527
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,720
But...

528
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,200
You don't have to persuade him.

529
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,480
Wen Qin is in the Fan Mountain

530
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
for his own people.

531
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,480
Not for saving others.

532
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
Wen Ruo still needs my medical skills.

533
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,200
He won't make things difficult for me.

534
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,160
Miss Wen.

535
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Let him go.

536
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,760
He has his plans.

537
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,640
Moreover,

538
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,640
I believe we'll meet again soon.

539
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,780
people

540
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,280
don't play hide-and-seek.

541
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,160
I'm sorry.

542
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,360
Changshan Red of Yueyang City.

543
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,440
Have a taste.

544
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,600
Sir,

545
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,320
have a taste of Changshan Red of Yueyang City.

546
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,000
Sir,

547
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,160
Changshan Red is not important.

548
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,440
Have a taste.

549
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Yueyang Red is not important.

550
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,000
Where are you going?

551
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,720
To find the first-class of the city.

552
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
Why are you looking for them?

553
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,680
I said

554
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,120
you're here for something.

555
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,040
I can't do it without you.

556
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
You can ask them

557
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,960
what you can ask them.

558
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,880
What should I ask them?

559
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,480
Of course,

560
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,280
that place.

561
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
You just want to drink?

562
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,200
No.

563
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,400
I'll share the company with them.

564
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,680
Think about it.

565
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,520
There are many customers and people here.

566
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,120
If there's something strange,

567
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,680
they must be there.

568
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,680
You're talking too much.

569
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,040
You can't say anything.

570
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,600
Hello, Uncle Xiaoxiu.

571
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,960
How is Nie Qiong?

572
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,040
They haven't arrived yet.

573
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,920
Let's find a place to rest.

574
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,040
That's good.

575
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,040
Let's go.

576
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,240
Let's go.

577
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,760
Let's go.

578
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Let's go.

579
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,000
Three bottles of wine.

580
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,040
You're crazy.

581
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,360
You're so quick.

582
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,280
We've got a lot of money.

583
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
We're rich.

584
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,960
We have to be like you.

585
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
We have to be like you.

586
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,800
Wait a minute.

587
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,520
I don't want some money.

588
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,040
I can spend it.

589
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,120
You're done with your money.

590
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,960
Don't mind me.

591
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
Here's your wine.

592
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,920
Sir, your wine.

593
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,360
Ask them if you have something.

594
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,360
Xiaowan.

595
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
This is the first time we've come to Yueyang.

596
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,200
What's the fun of

597
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,880
having something to listen to?

598
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,000
You want to ask what's the fun?

599
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,120
The more I have fun, the more I'm getting used to it.

600
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,040
So, what's the fun?

601
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,080
The fun?

602
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,800
The fun is

603
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,040
having a ghost house,

604
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,440
a house, a house, a branch,

605
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,640
or having a cave.

606
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,040
Is there anyone who's been killed?

607
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
That's the kind of thing.

608
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,040
Sir, you're so serious.

609
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,760
Where's the east-south direction?

610
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,040
The east-south is

611
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,960
the first house in Changsha.

612
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,040
Sir, you said that

613
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,960
I remember something strange.

614
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,120
Tell me.

615
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,360
If you go out of the city

616
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,400
and see a beautiful house,

617
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,680
you'll see a beautiful house.

618
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,800
That's the first house in Changsha.

619
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,160
First house in Yueyang?

620
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,000
The first house in this place?

621
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes, it's the first house in the city.

622
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,240
Although the people in Changsha are very conservative,

623
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,880
they're also living in Yueyang.

624
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,080
But I don't know what's going on.

625
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,880
Everyone is so agitated.

626
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,400
Is it missing?

627
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,480
It should be.

628
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,960
But it shouldn't be.

629
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,040
What do you mean?

630
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
It's said that the missing person

631
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,880
suddenly appeared in Yueyang

632
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,560
because of the people in the city.

633
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,000
But every night,

634
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,440
they could hear the sound of the door

635
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,880
coming from the city.

636
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,720
The sound of the door?

637
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,560
Yes.

638
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,600
It's been knocking for more than ten days.

639
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,240
The door is knocking every day.

640
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,000
It's crying and shouting inside.

641
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
It seems that everyone is locked in there.

642
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
They can't get out.

643
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,480
Has anyone been there?

644
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,680
Yes.

645
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,880
But there's no one in the white day.

646
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,480
They just open the door at night.

647
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,960
What do you think this is?

648
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,360
Look.

649
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,760
It's going to be night again.

650
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,160
Go.

651
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,120
Be careful.

652
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,760
Be careful.

653
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,520
Lan Zhan.

654
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,760
Lan Zhan.

655
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
個 starts from you.

656
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,280
Lan Zhan.

657
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,600
Ling背?

658
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,200
There's an up sequence in the beginning.

659
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,360
There's the over coming.

660
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Let's go!

661
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Let's go to the city.

662
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,960
I don't want to go.

663
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,460
I'll just wait for Meng Yao here.

664
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
Hey!

665
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
There's no way to knock on the door.

666
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Could it be that little girl?

667
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
She's talking nonsense.

668
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,560
Someone has used the Yin-Tian here.

669
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
Let's go.

670
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Let's go.

671
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Open the door.

672
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Field En piace

673
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Blood River.

674
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
It's in behind the door.

675
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,360
云月

676
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,060

677
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,860

679
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
I'm not sure if I can do it.

680
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
I'm not sure.

681
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm not sure.

682
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.

688

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
I'm not sure.

690

I'm not sure.

691
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560

I'm not sure.

698

I'm not sure.

699
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560

Bi, I'm not sure.

710
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Where to now?

711
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,060
To a year of old

712
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,660
I'm heartbroken

713
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,320
To a year old

714
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,560
Where are you going to go in the spring?

715
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,420
I've been waiting for years

716
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,480
to meet you
