1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 22

3
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
Lan Zhan,

4
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
do you think

5
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,000
this place is very familiar?

6
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,550
That year, in Cloud Recesses

7
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,320
you and I were sitting face-to-face like this.

8
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,440
We were fighting.

9
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,320
Right. Right. Right.

10
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,440
It's when I broke the curfew

11
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,190
and was caught by you, Second Childe Lan.

12
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,110
It's a pity that

13
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,520
there is no Emperor's Smile now.

14
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,030
Things change.

15
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,030
How could it be the same?

16
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,910
Lan Zhan,

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,830
thank you.

18
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,830
For what?

19
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,470
Thank you for not telling my senior sister.

20
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,390
These tricks harm your body

21
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,320
and your temperament the more.

22
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,750
I know.

23
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,520
But Lan Zhan,

24
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,520
what I practice is not Xue Chonghai's wicked tricks.

25
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,390
I learn crafty tricks.

26
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,960
Crafty tricks?

27
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
That was what I learned

28
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,160
in a sunless dingy place for three months.

29
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
But

30
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,390
after all,

31
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,440
I have to thank for your Lan clan's Temperament Technique.

32
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,000
My crafty tricks require

33
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,910
practicing temperament

34
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,470
and studying talisman.

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,550
With a bamboo flute

36
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,390
everything can be controlled.

37
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,550
Do crafty tricks

38
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,640
rely on the spirit?

39
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,830
Mastering it by mind

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,760
is like taking a grain from burning fire.

41
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,480
If not take it carefully,

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,830
you have risks of degenerating into demonic cultivation.

43
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,350
The consequence will be unthinkable.

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,670
I know.

45
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Lan Zhan.

46
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,640
I understand your concern.

47
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,790
But I, Wei Ying, promise you

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
that I will never degenerate into demonic cultivation.

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,950
Believe me or not?

50
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,790
Let me help you.

51
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,950
OK.

52
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,510
Wen Ruohan of Qishan, as His Excellency

53
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,510
is intended to annex the gentry greedily.

54
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,920
He forge Yin Iron privately,

55
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,350
and kill the innocent crucially.

56
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,350
He ordered Wen Xu, Wen Chao and his men to

57
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,830
to commit countless crimes,

58
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,670
which brings frightful calamity to our clans.

59
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,950
So that the world is filled with indignation.

60
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,390
Today

61
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,160
I, Nie Mingjue of Qinghe, lead an army to suppress Wen Ruohan.

62
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,270
We'll storm into Nevernight

63
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,200
and get his head off

64
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,160
to sacrifice for the souls of the deceased.

65
00:06:46,040 --> 00:07:07,200
Sunshot. Sunshot. Sunshot.

66
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,160
Go.

67
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,920
Sister, I go first.

68
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,950
Wait for you at Qishan.

69
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,160
I have said you should be a vanguard with me,

70
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,200
maneuver the sword to go to Qishan

71
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,390
and kill a few scoundrels of Wen clan first.

72
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,880
Why don't you maneuver the sword to go to Qishan?

73
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,110
I don't want to join in the fun

74
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,550
with Jiang Cheng and that colorful peacock.

75
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,270
Aren't you the one who prefers to join in the fun?

76
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,230
Bro Wei,

77
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Take care!

78
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,760
Go. Go. Go.

79
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,080
Childe. Go.

80
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,400
Go now.

81
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,470
Childe. Retreat quickly.

82
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,790
Or we are going to be completely annihilated.

83
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,960
Go now!

84
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,710
Go now!

85
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Sure enough, this method is effective.

86
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,110
Thanks you, Your Excellency.

87
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,790
Clan Leader Nie.

88
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,840
This time when we siege Nevernight,

89
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,000
Jiang and Jin Clan suffered a great loss

90
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,790
owing to my misjudgment.

91
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,640
It seems that the power of Yin Iron

92
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,760
can not be underestimated indeed.

93
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,590
Right.

94
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,320
This time, Childe Jin and I attacked Wen clan
till we arrived at the foot of Qishan.

95
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,590
Those puppets are hard to destroy as if they are unkillable.

96
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,790
Even the broken limb attacks.

97
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,350
If it's the power of Yin Iron

98
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,000
is really inexhaustible,

99
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,000
how can we take over Nevernight?

100
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,150
True.

101
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,320
Even we have millions of troops,

102
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,230
it's impossible for us to fight with the unkillable.

103
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,400
Since we can't attack them directly,

104
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,760
in my opinion,

105
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,640
we should capture the leader and the gang will collapse.

106
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,880
What do you mean?

107
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
I will sneak into Nevernight alone

108
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,710
to assassinate Wen Ruohan.

109
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,910
If he dies,

110
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,670
his puppets will not be controlled.

111
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,200
At that moment...

112
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,080
Clan Leader Nie,

113
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,080
It's extremely hard to assassinate Wen Ruohan.

114
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,790
How can we let you get into danger?

115
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,910
But as commander in chief,

116
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,790
how can I sit by to see my officers and soldiers die in vain?

117
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,350
If I die,

118
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,760
Zewu Jun will control the situation.

119
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,960
Leader Clan Nie.

120
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,150
Bro Mingjue,

121
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I have a thing to present.

122
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,470
Please have a look, everyone present.

123
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,640
This is?

124
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,000
Formation Map of Qishan.

125
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
How can they be hurt like this?

126
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,550
If you come across Wen clan's puppets,

127
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,200
it is better to be killed by sword.

128
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,440
If we aren't careful enough

129
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,150
and touch their bloody cracks,

130
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,000
we will be the same.

131
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
It seems that three tactical deployments of Qishan

132
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,880
have dramatically increased Yin Iron's power.

133
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,790
How about it, Lan Zhan?

134
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Is it incurable?

135
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,790
It requires at least three months'

136
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,000
transfusion of spiritual power.

137
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,280
Childe Wei. Childe Wei.

138
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,920
What happened?

139
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,950
Come and have a look quickly.

140
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,280
Lady Jiang.

141
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,430
Lady Jiang, she...

142
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Senior sister.

143
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,470
Senior sister.

144
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,520
-Xian. - Senior sister.

145
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,400
What happened to you?

146
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,070
Don't cry.

147
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,190
Tell me,

148
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,110
Is there any asshole who bullies you?

149
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,520
Xian,

150
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,760
I'm fine.

151
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,110
Let's go.

152
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,640
Go.

153
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,110
Go.

154
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Childe Wei.

155
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,040
You come at the right time.

156
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,950
Tell me what on earth happened here.

157
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,190
Childe Wei, it's not what you think.

158
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,350
Just tell me what you know.

159
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,800
Go ahead.

160
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,520
Tell the truth.

161
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,640
It looks like we Jin clan

162
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,950
do something shameful.

163
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,560
You.

164
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,560
Childe Wei.

165
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,640
Xian.

166
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,110
Here is the thing.

167
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,590
Since Lady Jiang is with the army,

168
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
she cures the injured

169
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,110
while helping with the diet.

170
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,310
Everyday

171
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Lady Jiang makes three more bowls of soup,

172
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,680
two of which

173
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,520
are for her two brothers

174
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
you, Childe Wei and Childe Jiang.

175
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,070
And the third one

176
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,640
is for our Childe Jin.

177
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,070
Nonsense.

178
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,310
It's Yuan.

179
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,640
Childe, it's not the case.

180
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,520
Lady Jiang is too shy to give you the soup

181
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,040
so she asked Yuan to do it.

182
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,230
Lady Jiang asked me first

183
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,800
but I thought it was not appropriate.

184
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,190
So I gave the mission to Yuan

185
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,040
and let her put it in Childe's room secretly.

186
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,000
I didn't expect...

187
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,680
Childe,

188
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,760
please don't blame Lady Jiang.

189
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,000
But...

190
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,830
Yuan did tell me...

191
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,830
Did she blush

192
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,680
and deny it vaguely?

193
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Mianmian, keep going.

194
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Today Lady Jiang came across Childe Jin

195
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,590
when she brought the soup over.

196
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,590
Maybe our childe thought

197
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,310
Lady Jiang imitated Yuan,

198
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,640
so he reminded Lady Jiang

199
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,040
and let her...

200
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,950
Childe Jin, you misunderstand me.

201
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,710
It...

202
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,470
- It's me... - Lady Jiang,

203
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,560
since our engagement has been annulled,

204
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,190
why are you doing this?

205
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,350
Do you think I did it because of engagement?

206
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,230
I accompanied you to Qinghe

207
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,710
and completed my mission.

208
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,310
You needn't have followed me to suffer in the battlefield?

209
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,280
I did not follow...

210
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,310
I was...

211
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,760
This was what I gave Yuan.

212
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,640
No. No,

213
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,680
it isn't.

214
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,640
Lady Jiang,

215
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,000
I strongly advise you

216
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,110
not to steal and trample on others' goodwill at will,

217
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,640
even that you come from the gentry families.

218
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,400
Even someone didn't born with a sliver spoon,

219
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,590
she has a nobler character than you.

220
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,760
Please be self-dignified.

221
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,680
Be self-dignified?

222
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,640
Jin Zixuan,

223
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,000
how dare you to let my senior sister be self-dignified?

224
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,070
Childe Wei,

225
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,760
my childe actually did nothing.

226
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,920
You get him wrong.

227
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,800
Right. Childe Wei.

228
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,830
It's a mistake.

229
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,800
Calm down. This is a mistake.

230
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,590
Right. Please calm down.

231
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,560
Mistake?

232
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,950
- Xian, Xian. - Childe Wei.

233
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,350
Wei Ying, cool down.

234
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,880
Xi Chen,

235
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,070
Formation Map of Qishan is concerned with formation of Yin Iron.

236
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,190
It's so confidential.

237
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,040
How did you get this?

238
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,040
Wen clan of Qishan is as hard as iron cask though,

239
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,350
it still can be permeated by water.

240
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,590
It takes a few months,

241
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,640
so even there are minor mistakes,

242
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,560
they are within the least bit.

243
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,680
Please allow me to report the map painter later.

244
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,560
But I have observed the map for several days

245
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,880
and it is accurate indeed.

246
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,310
Or else I dare not give it to you directly.

247
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,110
Anyway

248
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,190
you have never told me

249
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,070
after Cloud Recess was burned down,

250
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,520
where on earth did you go

251
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,880
and who saved you?

252
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,110
Sure enough bro Mingjue is thoughtful.

253
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,470
So

254
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,160
the map painter and your rescuer

255
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,230
are the same person.

256
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,880
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

257
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,560
It's just that Sunshot Campaign is yet unfinished.

258
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,160
This person has a secret identity.

259
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,590
Without his permission,

260
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,350
I dare not leak his identity.

261
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,590
So I hope that you

262
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,760
won't blame me please.

263
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,310
You are grateful and honest.

264
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,830
How can I blame you?

265
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,310
Thus,

266
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,560
I believe you.

267
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,880
However,

268
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,800
The formation of Qishan is indeed precise.

269
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,920
Asshole Wen put three Yin Irons

270
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,590
in three parts as crucial sites.

271
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,590
It seems

272
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,760
not only my fate is hard to predict,

273
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,110
even you...

274
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,830
Sunshot Campaign is last stand anyway.

275
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,470
For everyone of us,

276
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,070
we have no way back.

277
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,230
Right.

278
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,920
So we work together.

279
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,710
No matter whether I succeed in killing bastard Wen or not,

280
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,560
in seven days,

281
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
we will launch the general attack,

282
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,280
and storm into Nevernight.

283
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,000
- Brother. - Zewu Jun.

284
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,880
Childe Jiang.  Childe Wei.

285
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,070
Wangji,

286
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,640
when we were back to city,

287
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,160
we came across Wen Ruohan's puppets.

288
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,520
Now they may have flanked our rear.

289
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,040
Presumably they are close to us.

290
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,590
So is our rear.

291
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,000
Now there are pursuing forces after two armies.

292
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,710
It seems now,

293
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,920
there is only one way to go.

294
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,280
Nevernight.

295
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,470
I am afraid that those three queues of puppets

296
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,950
don't want to kill us.

297
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,950
Instead, they want to corner us into Nevernight.

298
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,230
Wen Ruohan tempts us to go deliberately.

299
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,430
And Bro Mingjue disappears without a trace.

300
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,190
Now the appointed time hasn't come yet.

301
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,040
We attacking Qishan recklessly like this

302
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,280
may destroy big plan of Clan Leader Nie.

303
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,110
Now we are in a dilemma.

304
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,640
I am afraid we have been in the trap.

305
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,070
Going to Nevernight or not

306
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,160
is not up to us.

307
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,430
So

308
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,430
we have a rest here for a while

309
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,190
and attack Nevernight.

310
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,160
Zewu Jun,

311
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,830
who on earth gave you Formation Map of Qishan?

312
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,350
An old friend did.

313
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,880
- Brother. - Wangji.

314
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,430
You don't have to ask me about his identity.

315
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,880
He is a friend, not an enemy.

316
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,590
Even today it is him who tempts us into Nevernight.

317
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,830
He must have a reason.

318
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,800
Nie Mingjue.

319
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,070
You claimed my Yin Iron is wicked trick.

320
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,350
Today I am gonna

321
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,590
show you the righteous man

322
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,680
how powerful our wicked tricks are.

323
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,350
Clan Leader Nie,

324
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
long time no see.

325
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,160
You. It's you.

326
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,230
How dare you be so rude in front of Clan Leader Wen?

327
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I'm so incompetent

328
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,640
to bother Clan Leader.

329
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,230
Trash.

330
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,920
Did he kill Wen Xu?

331
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,310
Now outside Scorching Sun Palace comes a good play.

332
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,350
Meng Yao,

333
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,000
it is designed by you in person.

334
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,710
Don't you wanna see?

335
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,950
Childe Wei,

336
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,160
what should we do now?

337
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,640
Shall we march into it?

338
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,190
So many puppets!

339
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,950
Given the quantity of those puppets,

340
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,390
we know Wen Ruohan has hurt many people.

341
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,600
Lan Zhan,

342
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,870
what method can we take now

343
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,280
to escape?

344
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,470
Fight.

345
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,600
Why?

346
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,040
Why didn't the Yin Iron work?

347
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,470
Who?

348
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,520
Who?
