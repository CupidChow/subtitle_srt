1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:11,000
ï¿½

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't you want anything?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wei Wuxian, you're so fearless.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're so great.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You've done a good deed.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You've made people feel good.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You've made people feel touched.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I should kneel down and thank you.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Uncle, stop talking.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't let you thank me.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You've done a good deed.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You've made people feel good.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Of course, you're different from me.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No wonder father always said

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you're the one who knows the real Jiang family.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're the one who knows the Jiang family.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Enough.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Enough?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You said enough.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know it.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You've done everything.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're so talented.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're so smart.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm the first one to be respect.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What am I?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Chief Jiang, your wound.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chief Jiang, be careful.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Chief Jiang, don't be so agitated.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you say it again, I'm afraid the wound will be worse.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why, Wei Wuxian?

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Tell me why.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How much does the Jiang family give you?

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because I'm his son.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm the heir to the Jiang family.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But all these years,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you've been suppressed.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yang Yuzheng even died.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My father, my mother, my sister

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and Jin Zixuan's life.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because you're the only one left

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
with no father and no mother.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wei Wuxian,

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
who is the one who was put in the test

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and was afraid of the Jiang family?

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You said

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you'll be my family in the future.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You'll be my subordinate.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You'll support me all my life.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What are they?

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We have a twin-wit alliance.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We'll never betray the Jiang family.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who said that?

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I asked you who said that?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Did you eat all of it?

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What happened?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You went to protect the foreigners?

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Or the Wen family?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You ate all of them.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You said that you'll betray them.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're the one who did all the good things.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You did all the bad things

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that the Jiang family did.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're always so selfish.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What kind of bitter curse is that?

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bitter curse?

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You didn't tell me anything.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You treated me like a fool.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Uncle.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wei Wuxian,

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you owe us the Jiang family.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Shouldn't I hate you?

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can't I hate you?

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why?

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why do I feel sorry for you?

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why do I have to feel so bad?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I feel like a bad guy.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What am I?

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm so bad.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Can't I open my eyes?

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can't I hate you?

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Uncle, I'm hurt.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let him come.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't you fear the wolf?

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Uncle.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why?

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why do you keep me?

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you tell me?

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why do you keep me?

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because I don't want to see you like this.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Uncle.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said that

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you would be my family

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and you would be my subordinate.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I will never be afraid of the Jiang family.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You said that.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I've made a mistake.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's time.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I want you to say sorry.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm a very precious person.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't say sorry to me.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll give it back to the Jiang family.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't put it in your heart.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Forget it.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Although I know that you will always remember me.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But how can I say?

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I really feel that it's all over now.

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Those things

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
are not going to be over.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Those things

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
seem to be the past.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let go of it.

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's not talk about it anymore.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Brother.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Where am I?

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Brother.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How are you, Zongzhu?

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's all for you.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's wrong?

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Are you okay?

154
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Mingshan, take my hand.

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yudu.

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I swear.

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll kill you.

158
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Zongzhu, let me go.

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Zongzhu.

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Brother.

161
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Zongzhu.

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Brother.

163
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Brother.

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Brother.

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Brother.

166
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What the hell are you doing?

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Zou Wujun.

168
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You've misunderstood the gold sect leader.

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
As far as I know,

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the things here are not buried by him.

171
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Even if it was him who buried it,

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
it should have been taken care of by someone.

173
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Am I right?

174
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Gold sect leader.

175
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Wei Wuxian.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm not being modest.

178
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If I were to do something,

179
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm afraid your sect leader is hurt now.

180
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not that easy to protect him.

181
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Gold sect leader.

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you remember the letter

183
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that Qin Su gave you on the gold stage?

184
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Tell Qin Su that you did something good.

185
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was the maid of the former Qin.

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But why did she suddenly decide

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to take out your things?

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Did she have no one to push her?

189
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And the maid you locked up.

190
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Who saved her?

191
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Who taught her to go to Yunmeng Jiang's world with the maid of the former Qin?

192
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
She took out your secret in front of everyone.

193
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She could find out your secret in one of the ten.

194
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
She took a step to come here

195
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and changed your things

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
into a body of Chifeng Honest.

197
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
When you reach the end, I'll give it to you.

198
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There's nothing impossible.

199
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Sect leader.

200
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Someone must have come in

201
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
from the other side.

202
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Guozhan.

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Qin Su.

204
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Have you ever thought about it?

205
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You're the leader tonight.

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But there's a lie behind you.

207
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That person who's been watching you

208
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
is hiding in some corner

209
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
at this moment.

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He's trying to trick you.

211
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

212
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe he's not human.

213
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Wei Wuxian.

214
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Stop doing this.

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't be so impulsive.

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll go.

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Order the rest of the troops to set off.

218
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes.

219
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Sect leader.

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The back door is closed.

221
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Take care of your wound first.

222
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes.

223
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This dormitory is weird to others.

224
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The way back to the light is so familiar.

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Turn around.

226
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's you.

227
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're a real monster.

228
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He's so evil.

229
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He's not a good man.

230
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Brother.

231
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What's going on?

232
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's you.

233
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So this is the end of the murder.

234
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You asked us to summon Mr. Wei.

235
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Because you knew that

236
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Jin Zixuan would kill him

237
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
because he was wearing a white mask.

238
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What?

239
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Zixuan.

240
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Are you and Mr. Wei

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
having any problems?

242
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No.

243
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Brother.

244
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Why didn't you do that?

245
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you need to ask?

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If Jin Zixuan didn't get the curse,

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
nothing would happen.

248
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The murder was solved

249
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
by you and Jin Zixuan.

250
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You two were in the same boat.

251
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You were sent to the south of the capital.

252
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You were the first to get rid of all the obstacles.

253
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The curse was solved by you.

254
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who did you get the curse from?

255
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you have any questions?

256
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Jin Guangyao.

257
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I have no grudge against you.

258
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't even know you.

259
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You killed Jin Zixuan.

260
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why do you want to be kicked out of my body?

261
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Mr. Wei.

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You should know this.

263
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
No grudge or grudge

264
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
can make you feel safe.

265
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
How is that possible?

266
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Everyone in this world

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is originally grudges and grudges.

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There will always be someone

269
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
who will start the first round

270
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
of the evil spirit.

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I will kill you.

272
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You are so mean.

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You have no right to blame me.

274
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You people are

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
so arrogant and arrogant.

276
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You just want to kill yourself.

277
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You have a family.

278
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You have no right to blame me.

279
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We are not human.

280
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We are not human.

281
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If I have the ability to protect myself,

282
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I will be threatened by others.

283
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Wei will be like

284
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the Lan family.

285
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you say you want to kill yourself,

286
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you will kill yourself.

287
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Wei.

288
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You.

289
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I will not spare you

290
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
if you betray your family.

291
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Lord Han.

292
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I hate your attitude

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
of being so arrogant.

294
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I just think you can never

295
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
let me go because of your little mistake.

296
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I will be the first to

297
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
kill myself.

298
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Except for the curse,

299
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
who do you think you are?

300
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I want to tell you

301
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that the person who killed

302
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
the five of you in the tomb

303
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
is me.

304
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I will kill you.

305
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What are you laughing at?

306
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Nothing.

307
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I just didn't expect it.

308
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What did you think?

309
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I just didn't expect

310
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that you killed so many people

311
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
because of this.

312
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I just didn't expect

313
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that you killed so many people

314
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
because of this.

315
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Childe Wei.

316
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Do you think you are too wronged?

317
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Actually,

318
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I am not wronged.

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I am not wronged.

320
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes.

321
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Childe Wei.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Think about it.

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Even if we

324
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
don't go to the Jinzi Xun to kill you,

325
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I want you, Childe Wei,

326
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to be killed

327
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
because of other reasons.

328
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Because you are like this.

329
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Say it well.

330
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I will kill you.

331
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Say it well.

332
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I will kill you.

333
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Say it hard.

334
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I will offend you.

335
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Unless you offend people,

336
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
you will be safe forever.

337
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Otherwise,

338
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
if they have any problem,

339
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the first suspect will be you.

340
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The first suspect will be you.

341
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And this is...

342
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You can't control it.

343
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Even if you didn't have time

344
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
in the night sky,

345
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
you can guarantee

346
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
that you won't have time

347
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
in your whole life.

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So,

349
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
you are destined to be a man like this.

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Look.

351
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You are so small.

352
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You are so kind.

353
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So small.

354
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You are so kind.

355
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You are much better.

356
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You are short-lived.

357
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Your son, Chang Ji,

358
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
is not worth anything

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
for the sake of the online case.

360
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You are so...

361
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Chief Jiang,

362
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
calm down.

363
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I understand your feelings.

364
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You are so angry now.

365
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You just know the truth.

366
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I have been thinking about

367
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
what you have done for so many years.

368
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Your proud heart

369
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
is so guilty.

370
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So,

371
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you are looking for a murderer

372
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
before Childe Wei.

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You can take away

374
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
all the blame.

375
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Chief Jiang,

376
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
if you think that

377
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you can take away all the blame

378
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
on me,

379
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
you can feel better.

380
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Please do as you please.

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But you need to understand

382
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
that Childe Wei is so down.

383
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You also have the blame.

384
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And you have a big blame.

385
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why are so many people

386
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
trying to escape from the Yiling prison?

387
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Why are they

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
being so angry

389
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
about what happened?

390
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Why are they being

391
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
beaten up by the people?

392
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Are they really just being impulsive?

393
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Of course not.

394
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Some of the reasons

395
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
are because of you.

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Shut up!

397
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
After the war,

398
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
the Lanling Jin clan,

399
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Qinghe Nian clan,

400
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and the three families of Gusu and Lan clan

401
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
have separated.

402
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And you

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
just rebuilt the Lotus Cove.

404
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
There is a dangerous

405
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and unimaginable Wei Wuxian behind you.

406
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Do you think other families

407
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
will be happy to see

408
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
such a young family

409
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
who is so capable of

410
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
doing such a thing?

411
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So, Chief Jiang,

412
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
you used to be

413
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
kind to your senior brother.

414
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It seems that the Lotus Cove

415
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
between you is irreversible.

416
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Or after the war,

417
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
you have to be more tolerant

418
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and make others feel helpless.

419
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Things

420
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
will not turn into

421
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
the way they used to be.

422
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Qing Guangyao,

423
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
you are so vicious.

424
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Is that so?

425
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But Chief Jiang,

426
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
don't forget

427
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that the main force of the

428
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Waijiao Cove

429
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
is also yours.

430
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You have changed

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
so many things

432
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
for the son of Chang Ji.

433
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The son of Chang Ji

434
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
is really the rebel of Chief Jin.

435
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No wonder

436
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
you killed Chi Fengzun.

437
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Send someone out.

438
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes.

439
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Chief Jin.

440
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How did you kill Chi Fengzun?

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Why don't you tell us?

442
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You and Xue Yang

443
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
want to make Chi Fengzun

444
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
a puppet

445
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
who is very active.

446
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Aren't you afraid?

447
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Why should I be?

448
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm afraid

449
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
he will come back to you.

450
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm afraid

451
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm afraid

452
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm afraid

453
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm afraid

454
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
he will come back to you.

455
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Mother.

456
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Mother.

457
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Mother.

458
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm so dead.

459
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Mother.

460
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Mother.

461
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Mother.

462
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Mother.

463
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Mother.

464
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Mother.

465
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The Yiling Patriarch.

466
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's really the Yiling Patriarch.

467
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Even if this half-dead soul

468
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
is from Xue Yang's family

469
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
even if you don't have me

470
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
you can still

471
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
take care of it.

472
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You are so weak.

473
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You are going to recover your power.

474
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Mother.

475
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Chief Jin.

476
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Hand it over.

477
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You can't keep it.

478
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Chief Jin.

479
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Can I ask you a question?

480
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
What did you learn from the Yiling Patriarch?

481
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I think you can't learn

482
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the Yiling Patriarch

483
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
from Xue Yang's family.

484
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's easy to learn.

485
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Chief Jin is so lucky.

486
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He can learn it easily.

487
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I can't believe you.

488
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I can't believe you.

489
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I can't believe you.

490
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You can't understand

491
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
how much the family

492
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
sucks money at they house.

493
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Now that you have guessed it

494
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
why do you have to ask me?

495
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So from the moment

496
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you came back

497
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you had healed the Yiling Patriarch.

498
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I think you will be longer.

499
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,180
It's probably

500
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,080
the perfect time

501
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,000
for you and Xue Yang

502
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Mr Wei, why are you here?

503
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,640
I just went to drink.

504
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,200
I didn't expect to make the wrong way.

505
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,440
Meng Fu Shi,

506
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,160
why didn't you go to the banquet?

507
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,320
I ordered to watch Xue Yang.

508
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,040
It's not a proper event.

509
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,440
It's like a iron bucket.

510
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,040
I guess Xue Yang can't run away.

511
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,720
So I have Meng Fu Shi.

512
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,000
Please.

513
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,520
Before starting,

514
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,240
ããã,

515
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,520
å­é,

516
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,040
ladder and shower.

517
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
é£,

518
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,360
the dragon is comingâ¦

519
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,440
It's a good timing.

520
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,720
That's theĞ¸Ğ¿hone of this era.

521
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,360
It's not over,

522
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
It's the same as doing more,

523
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,680
and doing less.

524
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,160
Is there any difference?

525
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,960
You and Xue Yang worked together

526
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,200
just to train the Eagle Tiger Talisman.

527
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Xue Yang hid a silver chain.

528
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,120
He wanted to save Xing Chen.

529
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,720
So he worked with me

530
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,840
to train the Eagle Tiger Talisman.

531
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,000
Even if he was with me,

532
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,880
he could only train half of the Eagle Tiger Talisman.

533
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Mr. Wei,

534
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,200
I have a question

535
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,240
that I have been wondering about.

536
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,120
I've been wanting to ask you.

537
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
What is it?

538
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,040
I thought you took the silver chain

539
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,840
that Xue Yang had in your hand

540
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,840
and trained the Eagle Tiger Talisman.

541
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,840
But it didn't work.

542
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,400
You wanted to ask me

543
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,480
how I got the silver chain, right?

544
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Exactly.

545
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Xue Yang told me

546
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,800
that everyone thinks that

547
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
there are only four silver chains in the world.

548
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
But it's not.

549
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,720
Run!

550
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,720
Go!

551
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Run!

552
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,920
Run!

553
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
asts!

554
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Yes!

555
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
So that's how it was.

556
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,760
The death of the four sides is the Xuan Wu.

557
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
So that's what it meant.

558
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
You've done so many mistakes.

559
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,760
I just wanted to save the Yin Tiger Manor.

560
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Not everything.

561
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Don't you remember my reason?

562
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
I didn't know what you did.

563
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
I was always worried about you.

564
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Everything was so hard.

565
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
But now,

566
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
you've done so much for Ming.

567
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
I don't know what you did.

568
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,760
I don't know if I should believe it.

571
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
I'm sorry.

572
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
I'm sorry.

573
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
I'm sorry.

574
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Well,

575
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Princess Jin.

576
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Let's not talk.

577
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Let's do it.

578
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Let's just do it.

579
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Erge.

580
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
We've been together for years.

581
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
No matter what,

582
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
no matter what I do to you,

583
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
you know

584
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm not as good as the Xuan Du Manor.

585
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
The Yin Tiger Manor has been handed over.

586
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
After tonight, we'll be away from Dong Ye.

587
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
We won't come back.

588
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Just think about it.

589
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Let me go.

590
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
I'm sorry.

591
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
I'm sorry.

592
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I'm sorry.

593
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm sorry.
