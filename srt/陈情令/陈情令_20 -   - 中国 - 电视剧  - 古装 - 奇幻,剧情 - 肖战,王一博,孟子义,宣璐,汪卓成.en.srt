00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 20

3
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,480
What the hell...

4
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,440
Can't you keep quiet just for a while?

5
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
Yelling and screaming like hell.

6
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,920
Somebody,

7
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,320
go make that bitch quiet.

8
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,640
Where are my servants?

9
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,040
Where the hell are you all?

10
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,880
I told you to make that bitch quiet,

11
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,400
not to come in.

12
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,800
Stay away!

13
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Help...

14
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
I told you to leave me alone!

15
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,480
Leave me alone!

16
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,120
Please help me...

17
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,640
Help me...

18
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,920
Help...

19
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,640
Don't kill me...

20
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,040
Help me...

21
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,800
Stay away!

22
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
Help...

23
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
Help...

24
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
Leave me alone!

25
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Help...

26
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,720
Get away!

27
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,120
- Help! - Stay away!

28
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
- Go away! - Help!

29
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
Leave me alone!

30
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,280
Go, go away!

31
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,920
All of you, stay away!

32
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm sorry!

33
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm sorry, I was wrong!

34
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,800
I shouldn't have got you killed!

35
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,040
I shouldn't have!

36
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
Forgive me!

37
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,640
I scarred your face.

38
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll make up for it.

39
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,640
Make up for it.

40
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,040
I didn't kill you!

41
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
Stay away!

42
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
It's Wen Zhuliu.

43
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,920
He killed you all.

44
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,120
Not me!

45
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
Leave me alone!

46
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,680
Please forgive me!

47
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Not me! Please!

48
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Not me!

49
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,560
Please spare me! Please!

50
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Go!

51
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,200
Let me go!

52
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,240
There's strong malign energy.

53
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
And the smell of blood.

54
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Bled from all holes on head.

55
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,640
This one is not.

56
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
Hanged, burnt, drowned,

57
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,240
poisoned.

58
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
They all died for different causes.

59
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
It seems the mission today was finished

60
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,440
by something unknown.

61
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
Childe, all have been checked.

62
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,720
They all died

63
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,080
in different ways.

64
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,000
And a woman hanged herself inside the room.

65
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,960
A woman?

66
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,840
Yes.

67
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,760
Additional.

68
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,480
Right,

69
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,880
it has additional strokes.

70
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
This talisman

71
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,440
was reversed.

72
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,400
Reversed?

73
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,640
What does it mean?

74
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Normal talismans

75
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
ward off the evil.

76
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,880
This one

77
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,000
summons the evil.

78
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Summons the evil?

79
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,120
Talismans can summon the evil?

80
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,280
I've never heard of it.

81
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,680
It's exactly unusual.

82
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,560
But according to the situation here,

83
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,760
this talisman does have the reversed function.

84
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,360
Only by adding several strokes,

85
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,640
the function was totally reversed.

86
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,560
Was this done by some person?

87
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,800
We can see four strokes were added.

88
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
Judge form the smell,

89
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,920
they were painted with human blood.

90
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,080
All talismans inside this Supervisory Office

91
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
have been altered.

92
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,920
The style of writing

93
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,880
is from the same person.

94
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
Who can it be?

95
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Among gentry families,

96
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,120
no one is known for such ability.

97
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,680
But, whoever it is,

98
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
it's not a problem if we have the same goal.

99
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,360
Clan Leader, there is a survivor in the dungeon.

100
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,200
Quickly, stand up!

101
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,440
- Stop! - Stand up!

102
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
Clan Leader Jiang.

103
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,480
It never came to me that,

104
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
we could see each other again.

105
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,760
What did they do to you?

106
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Where...

107
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
Where is he?

108
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,800
This is what we grabbed

109
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,760
not long ago when Lan Wangji and I attacked Qishan.

110
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,960
Right.

111
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
At that time,

112
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
you were deprived of your swords.

113
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,560
That's to say,

114
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,520
you don't know where he is either.

115
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
Miss Wen,

116
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,880
I don't know how long you've been confined here,

117
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
but now the situation is clear.

118
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,640
Four main clans have allied to bring down Wen clan.

119
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,880
Wen Ruohan and Wen clan of Qishan

120
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
are doomed to failure.

121
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,040
Although there is deep hatred between me and Wen clan,

122
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
you...

123
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,600
have saved me after all.

124
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,240
If you are willing to leave Wen clan.

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,600
I...

126
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,240
Ning,

127
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
he was taken away by them.

128
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
He's still in Qishan.

129
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Wen Qing,

130
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,120
leave Wen clan.

131
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,120
I...

132
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,240
I can...

133
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,280
Clan Leader Jiang,

134
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,720
What can you do?

135
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,160
But after all I am a member of Wen clan.

136
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,880
I have my brother

137
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,360
and my families to look after.

138
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,360
You can save me

139
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
but you can't save them all.

140
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,880
Childe Jiang,

141
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,560
thank you for saving me.

142
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,760
We have saved each other once.

143
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,560
We are even now.

144
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,280
Miss Wen!

145
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,680
Miss Wen,

146
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
take this comb.

147
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,560
If anything happens to you in the future,

148
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,880
come to me

149
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
and I will help you again.

150
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,080
Let's go.

151
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,320
Where?

152
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,800
Qishan.

153
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,920
You mean that Wen Zhuliu has taken Wen Chao to run away?

154
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Then,

155
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,120
no use to stay

156
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,120
in this abandoned Supervisory Office.

157
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
How about we all

158
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
maneuver the swords to chase them.

159
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,920
Agreed.

160
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,590
Look at his dressing,

161
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,000
he must have high rank.

162
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,800
Was he killed by that person too?

163
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,040
Bled from all holes on head.

164
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,600
It should be the same person.

165
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,280
We tracked down Wen Chao along the way

166
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
but this person is always one step faster.

167
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Who could it be?

168
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,280
This person has strong wicked energy.

169
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,680
We should be careful.

170
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,720
Wicked?

171
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,200
Is there anything

172
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,760
that can be more wicked than Wen clan?

173
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,680
He's not an enemy,

174
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,720
as long as we have the same goal.

175
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,520
Let's go, we need to hurry up.

176
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Clan Leader,

177
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
we have received the news

178
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,680
that someone has spotted the trace of Wen Zhuliu

179
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
near the Yunmeng courier station.

180
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,520
Why didn't Wen Chao return to Qishan

181
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,800
but to Yunmeng?

182
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,560
Let's go.

183
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,880
Don't be rash.

184
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,120
Let's observe first

185
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
before we find Wen Chao.

186
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

187
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,720
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

188
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,960
Turn off the lights.

189
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,680
It will become worse if we are discovered.

190
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you think,

191
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
we won't be spotted if the lights are out?

192
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,200
Zhuliu,

193
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
don't you think that we can escape

194
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,360
since we have run so long time

195
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,200
and so far way?

196
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,640
Maybe.

197
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
What do you mean maybe?

198
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,280
We should continue running if there is 'maybe'.

199
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,720
Stay still,

200
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,720
I need to apply some medicine,

201
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
or you will die.

202
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,160
Don't move!

203
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,800
Look at me!

204
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,200
Look at me!

205
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,560
Stop your tears.

206
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,120
Stop crying.

207
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Tears will infect your wounds

208
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,680
and your wounds will turn worse.

209
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,600
Understand?

210
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,600
Don't cry.

211
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,440
The flute.

212
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,440
The flute.

213
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
Is he fluting?

214
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,520
No. It's the sound of wind.

215
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,760
Sound of wind.

216
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,600
Come and eat something.

217
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,360
Eat it and we can hurry on our journey.

218
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,720
No, I don't want it.

219
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,040
I want my father.

220
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,920
When can we find my father?

221
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
At this speed,

222
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
we have two days to go.

223
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,600
Two days.

224
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Two days.

225
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,520
Look at my terrible face.

226
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,320
How can you ask me to wait for another two days?

227
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,400
My father has kept you for what?

228
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
Such an useless!

229
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,240
You, good for nothing!

230
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,960
Go to kill him now!

231
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
Go! You, piece of junk!

232
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
No, no, no.

233
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,040
I was wrong.

234
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,040
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

235
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,400
Save me!

236
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
I'll recognize you as my big brother

237
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,720
and ask my father to let you enter the core of our clan.

238
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,840
You are my brother from now on.

239
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,640
No need.

240
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,800
Again.

241
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,400
At this moment,

242
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,640
Wen... Wen Zhuliu.

243
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,720
Do you still believe it's useful to call his name?

244
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,000
Wen Zhuliu.

245
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,360
Do you really believe

246
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
that you can save his cheap life

247
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,360
from me.

248
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,040
Just try with my life.

249
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,520
Such a loyal dog!

250
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
I have to repay His Excellency

251
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,560
for the kindness of promotion.

252
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,280
What a joke!

253
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,720
Why the other people

254
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,320
have to pay for your gratitude to Wen Ruohan?

255
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,720
Your sword!

256
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,520
Thanks!

257
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,560
You prick.

258
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,400
Where have you been for last three months?

259
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,480
It's a long story.

260
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,600
It's a long story.

261
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,600
We mada a deal

262
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,400
meet at the shabby town at foot of the hill, didn't we?

263
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,040
I waited for you for five days.

264
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,480
But not a soul came.

265
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,360
I was so worried for three months.

266
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
The other day,

267
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,600
Childe Lan and I

268
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,400
raided the Indoctrination Bureau in Nevernight.

269
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,960
They said that you were cast into Burial Mounds.

270
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,560
If I had been cast into the Burial Mounds,

271
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,240
how come I'm here now.

272
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,600
That's right,

273
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,120
nobody can survive that place.

274
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,320
Then where have they taken you to?

275
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,000
Yiling or the Nevernight?

276
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,840
And how did you get out?

277
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,280
And

278
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
How did you change into this look?

279
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,240
Really?

280
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,000
Have I changed?

281
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,000
No... Not exactly.

282
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,160
But where on earth have you been?

283
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,600
The other day,

284
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,280
Second Childe Lan and I were about to assault Wen Zhuliu at night

285
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,560
but someone had acted faster.

286
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,240
It never came to me that it's you.

287
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,200
It's you who also changed the talismans.

288
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,720
If I say

289
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
when I was fleeing, I entered a cave

290
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,520
where there was a rare book

291
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
a seclusive master left.

292
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,520
I learned it to gain the invincible power.

293
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,680
Do you believe it?

294
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Come on,

295
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,040
you've read too many caricatures.

296
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
There's not many seclusive masters

297
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,800
or rare books in real life.

298
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,680
Look,

299
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,320
you don't believe it even I told you.

300
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,720
As for the rest,

301
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,920
I will tell you after we go back.

302
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,360
Fine, let's talk this later.

303
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,720
It's good that you are back.

304
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,640
Why didn't you return sooner?

305
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,800
I just got out not long ago.

306
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,440
I heard that you and senior sister are all right.

307
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
You are busy rebuilding Jiang clan of Yunmeng

308
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,240
while fighting the war with allies.

309
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,760
Thanks for your efforts

310
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
in this three months.

311
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,040
Take your sword.

312
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,880
I was waiting for you to take it back.

313
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,640
I don't want to be raided with questions

314
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,560
about why I carry two swords everyday.

315
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,960
Wei Ying.

316
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Second Childe Lan.

317
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,760
No.

318
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,000
I should call Hanguang Jun.

319
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,760
The person hunt down disciples of Wen clan along the way.

320
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,000
Was that you?

321
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,800
So what if I am?

322
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,000
It's also you who changed those talismans?

323
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,150
By which means did you kill them?

324
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,710
Second childe Lan, what do you mean?

325
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,710
Why did you give up the sword

326
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
for something else?

327
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,710
Answer.

328
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,440
What if I refuse to answer?

329
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Lan Zhan.

330
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,080
We have just reunited after such a long time.

331
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,120
Confronting me with so many questions

332
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,480
is not proper.

333
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,920
Since we broke up in Xuanwu cave,

334
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,120
it has been months.

335
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,840
Even if you don't cherish our relation as classmates,

336
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,520
you shouldn't be so ruthless.

337
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,520
Answer.

338
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,630
I told you the fact but you don't believe it.

339
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,000
I can't explain it in just a few words.

340
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,600
Then you return to Gusu with me

341
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,280
to explain it clearly.

342
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,520
Gusu?

343
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,600
The place with more than three thousand disciplines?

344
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,400
I reject to go.

345
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
I prefer Yunmeng.

346
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,240
Wei Ying,

347
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,840
don't joke.

348
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,560
Second Childe Lan.

349
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,080
Lan Zhan,

350
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,560
what do really want?

351
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Wei Ying,

352
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,640
there will be a price of learning wicked tricks.

353
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,960
No exception throughout history.

354
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,800
These tricks harm your body

355
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,640
and your temperament more.

356
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
Wicked tricks?

357
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Second childe Lan,

358
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,880
I didn't snatch anyone's spirit.

359
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,920
How can it be taken as wicked tricks?

360
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,680
What I use are talismans.

361
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,200
What I practice is music.

362
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,200
Can those be taken as wicked tricks?

363
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,640
Even if those are wicked tricks,

364
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,800
I know myself and

365
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080
whether it will hurt me

366
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,800
or not.

367
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,640
As for temperament,

368
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,920
I'm in charge of my own mind.

369
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,920
I fully understand what I'm doing.

370
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,280
There is something

371
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,080
you can not decide.

372
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,360
After all,

373
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,360
how do the others

374
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
know my temperament

375
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,640
and why should it be their concern?

376
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,120
Wei Wuxian.

377
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,040
Lan Wangji.

378
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
Why do you choose now to be

379
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,360
at odds with me?

380
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,240
Who do you think you are?

381
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
What do you think you Lan clan are?

382
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,880
You thought I will never protest?

383
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,800
Second childe Lan,

384
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,480
now the problem of Wen is yet to be solved

385
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,360
and we are in need of fighting resource.

386
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,480
Why are you Lan clan of Gusu caring so much now?

387
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,040
With all due respect,

388
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,480
even if he were to be called to account

389
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,960
it shouldn't be your business.

390
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,200
He should follow anyone but you.

391
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,440
Wen Zhuliu.

392
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,360
Childe Jiang, Second Childe Lan.

393
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,360
I was wrong.

394
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,600
I was wrong.

395
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,160
I was wrong. I was wrong.

396
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,280
Forgive me. Forgive me.

397
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,120
Forgive me. Forgive me.

398
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,080
Don't kill me.

399
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,840
Don't kill me.

400
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
I was wrong. I was wrong.

401
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,680
Second Childe Lan.

402
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,240
It's the domestic affair of our Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

403
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,400
Please leave it to us.

404
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,840
Forgive me.

405
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,400
Forgive me.

406
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,080
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

407
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,520
Lan Wangji.

408
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,240
Why do you choose now to be

409
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,680
at odds with me?

410
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,160
Who do you think you are?

411
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,880
What do you think you Lan clan are?

412
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,880
Uncle Jiang and madam Yu.

413
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,320
You asked me to take good care of Jiang Cheng and senior sister.

414
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,680
I did it.

415
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,160
Rest in peace now.

416
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,280
What are you mumbling?

417
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,800
Nothing.

418
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,880
So,

419
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
will you go to Qinghe with me

420
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,640
to participate in the final combat of Sunshot Campaign.

421
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,640
You don't tell!

422
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,200
Why do you think why I return?

423
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,800
What's more.

424
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,840
Senior sister is in Qinghe.

425
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,120
You finally say something decent.

426
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,920
Right,

427
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,400
how is senior sister?

428
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,240
Is she still mad with me?

429
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
You'll see when you go there.

430
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,200
Endure it for a moment.

431
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,320
Are you OK?

432
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:19,960
Come, slowly.

433
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:20,960
Be careful!

434
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,600
Slowly.

435
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,480
Come

436
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,520
Slowly, slowly, don't hurry.

437
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,480
Don't hurry.

438
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,480
Have some medicine.

439
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,880
Thank you.

440
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,440
How is it?

441
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,840
Slowly.

442
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,960
Thank you.

443
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,280
Slowly, slowly.

444
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,280
Apply some medicine.

445
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:44,880
Please endure.

446
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,640
Endure it. Just a while.

447
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,280
It will be over soon.

448
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,760
Endure it.

449
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,600
Come.

450
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,480
Slowly, slowly.

451
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
Senior sister.

452
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,520
# With mind unsettling, #

453
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,400
# I ask the sky. #

454
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,720
# Looking back, #

455
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,680
# many years have passed without notice. #

456
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,040
# Hope there's no departure, #

457
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,720
# no sorrow. #

458
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,640
Xianxian.

459
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,160
# But no one would #

460
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,920
# call me "xian" anymore. #
