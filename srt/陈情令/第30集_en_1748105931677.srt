1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Fr glory channel was amazing because it was so beautiful.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was very睏.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the second time I saw black cats.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How many times did I see black cat?

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,900
Can we go in?

16
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,500
Sleep under the mattress.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,400
Channel Subscribe.

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,220
Someone calls me.

19
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,420
I have everything.

20
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,980
I'm not Ye LIVE.

21
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,000
Hi, Seen.

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,780
I did a given for him...

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,280
after this week.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,720
The mobile app was for connecting you to the studio session.

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
This is the phone user for Ifosia.

26
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,900
Bye.

27
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,960
This is SoNudaman.

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Can you be a little more aggressive?

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
This will make our radish taste bad.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
How can you sell it like this?

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Sell radishes! Sell radishes!

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Fresh and delicious radishes!

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Sell radishes!

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Fresh and delicious radishes!

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Fresh and delicious! Sell radishes!

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Come, let's go through the road!

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,960
The Yiling Laozu is personally respected.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
The Yiling family is a family.

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
The land is not a city.

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Yiling family...

41
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
You are so good at acting.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
This is the old-fashioned radish I just made.

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,960
It's more accurate and durable than other radishes in the world.

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
I'll change the radish for you.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
No money.

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Don't delay me saving the whole country.

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Come, take a look.

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
The Yiling Laozu is personally respected.

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
The Yiling family is a family.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Walk and walk. Don't miss it.

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Come, take a look.

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Sorry.

54
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Come, take a look.

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
You bastard!

56
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
You are so stupid!

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Come, take a look.

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Let him stay outside.

59
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Let him stay outside.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Sister.

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
What are you doing?

62
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
What is this?

63
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
You want to marry me?

64
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Shut up.

65
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Ah Xin.

66
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
I...

67
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm getting married soon.

68
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

69
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

70
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

71
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

72
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
I know.

74
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I heard about it.

75
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Who told you?

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
You're not going to leave.

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
But...

78
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
I'm the only one who came.

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
You can't see the groom.

80
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
I don't want to see the groom.

81
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Sister.

82
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:59,920
Looks nice

83
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
You don't believe in me, not her.

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,640
Is it because you have to say who is pretty?

85
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,400
You believe it?

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
Don't stand there.

87
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,200
Sit down and talk.

88
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,040
Ah Xin,

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
come and take a word.

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
What word?

91
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,640
I haven't been born yet.

92
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,880
Okay.

93
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,840
The next generation of Lanling Jin clan is the second generation of Ruzi.

94
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,520
Then it's called Jin Rulan.

95
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,480
Jin Rulan?

96
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,880
Not good.

97
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,480
Not good.

98
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Jin Rulan.

99
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
It sounds like the Lan family.

100
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,280
Why do the descendants of Yunmeng Jiang clan and Lanling Jin clan

101
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
call Rulan?

102
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,560
There's nothing bad about the Lan family.

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,680
Lan is a man in flowers.

104
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,680
How good.

105
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
It's me who's marrying.

106
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,560
It's not you who's marrying.

107
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,080
What's the need to be so hard?

108
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Okay.

109
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you know

110
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
Cheng is like this?

111
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,680
He gave me the suggestion of marrying you.

112
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, don't make trouble.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,640
I brought soup for you.

114
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,200
It's delicious.

115
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,960
Sister.

116
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
Sister, is there still him?

117
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,160
I brought the soup anyway.

118
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Is there any difference?

119
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,080
Yes.

120
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
Only Xiaowan

122
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,800
gave me this.

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm not sure what's going on.

124
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
And my food.

125
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

126
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I'm not sure what's going on.

127
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
But I still ask her

128
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,800
if we're going to be together.

129
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Who will be the one to be the one?

130
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
This is the taste of our dream.

131
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Are you afraid you can't get used to it?

132
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
No, no.

133
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I want to take her back to A Yuan.

134
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Where is Xian?

135
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Is he okay?

136
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Jingyi Ling Laozu.

137
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Shut up.

138
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
How was the injury last time?

139
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
It's already healed.

140
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
How many days?

141
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Just last day.

142
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
You know me.

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
This minor injury is not in the picture.

144
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
But your family is so good.

145
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
You broke my arm first.

146
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You broke my arm for seven days.

147
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I broke my arm for more than a month.

148
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Don't you think it's not in the picture?

149
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
It's your left hand.

150
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
You can't write.

151
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,800
You broke your arm for more than a month.

152
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
You're so much better.

153
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
You're like this in the future.

154
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Do you have any plans?

155
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Just like this.

156
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
They don't dare to go down the mountain.

157
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I don't dare to bother others.

158
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,800
As long as we don't bother the others.

159
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Don't be so active.

160
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Wei Wuxian, do you believe it?

161
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Even if you don't bother Shifei,

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Shifei will bother you.

163
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
There's only one person who has no plan.

164
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
But to harm someone,

165
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
there's only a thousand ways.

166
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
You're so good at it.

167
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
No matter how many ways he's using,

168
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I'll kill whoever comes.

169
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
You never listen to me.

170
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
You'll know one day

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
what I'm saying is right.

172
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Do you have any plans?

173
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Wei Wuxian,

174
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
you've thought it over.

175
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
You should go back this time.

176
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
We're familiar with these people.

177
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
You may not see them for a long time.

178
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
But I'll go back.

179
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
But I'll go back to see the familiar people.

180
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Ah Xin.

181
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Later,

182
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I found it in my father's study.

183
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
It should be yours.

184
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Take it.

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
We'll leave now.

186
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
It'll be a waste if someone sees it.

187
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Let's go.

188
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Ah Xin.

189
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Ah Xin.

190
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Wen Ning.

193
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Why are you still wearing this soup?

194
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Take it back to Ah Yuan.

195
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Whatever.

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Don't spill it.

197
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
You must not tell your sister

198
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
what happened today.

199
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Understand?

200
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Let's go.

201
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Here.

202
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
What are you looking at me for?

203
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
For dinner.

204
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Dinner.

205
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Why don't you drink soup?

206
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Drink soup.

207
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Listen.

208
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
When I was on the mountain today,

209
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
I met another person from Yiling's group.

210
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
The fortune he drew

211
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
was so ugly.

212
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
It was fake.

213
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Wei Youxian.

214
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
What's wrong?

215
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
What's wrong?

216
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm getting tired of eating radish.

217
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I don't have appetite.

218
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Really?

219
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I've figured it out.

220
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I can't always make fortune.

221
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
I also want to make new dishes for you.

222
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
For example,

223
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
what's the main dish?

224
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Main dish?

225
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
You're not a genius.

226
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
You're a man of the land of Lanzang.

227
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
You're a man of the land.

228
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Don't mention the main dish.

229
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm a man of the land.

230
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I can't make fortune.

231
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Who said we can't make fortune in Lanzang?

232
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I'm going to make fortune for you.

233
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Eat.

234
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I can make it.

235
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
What's this?

236
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
It's a soup.

237
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
What's that?

238
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm just...

239
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Do you want to try it?

240
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Okay.

241
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Here.

242
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Okay, drink it.

243
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
One more.

244
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Okay.

245
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Here.

246
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Be careful.

247
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Don't forget to wash your hands.

248
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
It's delicious.

249
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
One more.

250
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Okay.

251
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
One more.

252
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
A soup?

253
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Where did you get it?

254
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Sister, that...

255
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I...

256
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I'll get it for you.

257
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
You have something to tell me?

258
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Chief Jiang and Miss Jiang are here.

259
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Here, have some.

260
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,960
Goodness.

261
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
You're just like your father and my father.

262
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
What does a pair of arms and legs mean?

263
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
We have a pair of legs in our dreams.

264
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Don't ask me for a back leg.

265
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
When did I ask you for a back leg?

266
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I wish I could live a life without any fear.

267
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
I wish I could live a life without any fear.

268
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Wei Ying!

269
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Is this the promise we made to protect you?

270
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Lan Zhan,

271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
if there is a war between us,

272
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I'd rather die with you.

273
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,800
At least, I'd rather die with you.

274
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I'm not going to.

275
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm not in danger.

276
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
A Xian,

277
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
let's make a promise.

278
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Lan Ling is the next generation of Jin.

279
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
She's the second generation of the same.

280
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Then it's called Jin Rulan.

281
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Jin Rulan.

282
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Wei Wuxian,

283
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,800
do you really have to make the same choice?

284
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm not sure.

285
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
You're the best of the best.

286
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
You're the best of the best.

287
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I want to see

288
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
if you can make the same choice.

289
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm going to go.

290
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Mr. Jin,

291
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
all the Hall of Halls have been installed.

292
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Good.

293
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
It's indeed a very beautiful place.

294
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Thank you all.

295
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
After you finish your work,

296
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
you can rest for a while.

297
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Then you can help me

298
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
to get back to the temple.

299
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Thank you.

300
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
After you finish your work,

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
you can rest for a while.

302
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Then you can help me to get back to the temple

303
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
and the bathhouse.

304
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
What are you talking about?

307
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
I grew up in the Jiang clan in Yunmeng.

308
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
How could I not grow up in a good family?

309
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Sir.

310
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
What's wrong?

311
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Look.

312
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
What's this?

313
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
What's this?

314
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
What are you doing?

315
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
A Yuan.

316
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
What's wrong?

317
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Come.

318
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Sister.

319
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I finally got a little tooth

320
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
for A Yuan.

321
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
A Yuan is not sensible.

322
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Don't blame him.

323
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
It's okay.

324
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
It's a good idea.

325
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
A Yuan.

326
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
What's wrong with Brother Xian?

327
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
He...

328
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
It's okay.

329
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
He is Sister Xiang.

330
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Sister Xiang?

331
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
He is not like A Yuan.

332
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Sister Xiang is like me.

333
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Just like A Yuan.

334
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Sister Xiang.

335
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Then just go and see him.

336
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
A Yuan is right.

337
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Sister Xiang.

338
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Just go and see him.

339
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Then A Yuan, tell Brother Xian, okay?

340
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Okay.

341
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Go.

342
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Slow down.

343
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Brother Xian.

344
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm sorry.

345
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I was wrong.

346
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
When did you come in?

347
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Sister Wenjing said

348
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
you miss me.

349
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I just want to see him.

350
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Sister Wenjing.

351
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Sister Wenjing.

352
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Sister Wenjing.

353
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Sister Wenjing.

354
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Sister Wenjing.

355
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Sister Wenjing.

356
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Sister Wenjing.

357
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Just let him be.

358
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
He is far away.

359
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
He won't go.

360
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Just fly over him.

361
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
It's not easy to fly over a bird.

362
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
It's okay.

363
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I'll take you to fly.

364
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I'll take you to fly.

365
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Okay.

366
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Come here.

367
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Take me to fly.

368
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Fly.

369
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Fly.

370
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Fly.

371
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Fly.

372
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Fly.

373
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Childe Jing.

374
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Now,

375
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
there is nothing else to do.

376
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Childe Jing,

377
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
everything is done.

378
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
All the servants

379
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
will follow your instructions.

380
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Although it's done,

381
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
we can't let it go.

382
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
This is the first big event

383
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
in our family.

384
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
We must do our best.

385
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Do you understand?

386
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Yes.

387
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
He seems to be very considerate.

388
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
I didn't expect him to be so considerate.

389
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Father,

390
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Yao is a good person.

391
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
She is considerate to the Jin family.

392
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I think

393
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
you don't need to be considerate to her.

394
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
She is considerate to the Jin family.

395
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
I'm worried about her.

396
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Anyway,

397
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Zixuan,

398
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
the future of the Jin family

399
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
must be yours.

400
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
No matter what,

401
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
you can't be

402
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
in the hands of a

403
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
family member.

404
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Do you understand?

405
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Yes, father.

406
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
What are you doing?

407
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
What are you doing?

408
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Why aren't you tying your hair?

409
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Because

410
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
you are having problems over anything.

411
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Go back to your control.

412
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Take a look.

413
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
I told you

414
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I'll tie it.

415
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Isn't that great?

416
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
That's good.

417
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Such a henchmen!

418
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
That's great.

419
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,380
Amazing!

420
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,440
Is it here?

421
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,540
Lin, this one you're the one who 돼intending the lecture.

422
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,780
Yes, recently Jin clan has been practicing the Yanxi.

423
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,540
They invited the four of them to practice.

424
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
I also came here to celebrate.

425
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
Mr. Qi Wei,

426
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,540
what's the good of this Ji Ling Ta?

427
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,540
This Yiling is indeed a small place.

428
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,540
Yes, you don't know that?

429
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,540
The young lady of Lanling Jin clan

430
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,540
just killed a young master five days ago.

431
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,540
This is the most precious thing of the leader and the grandson of the Jin clan.

432
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,540
No, Lanling Jin clan is going to practice the Yanxi Qinghe for more than seven days.

433
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
What did you say?

434
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
This is a lie.

435
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
What are you lying to me?

436
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
This is the first time that I've taken care of the world.

437
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,340
Even if you think of the name,

438
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
the name of the capital is the most important thing.

439
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
You are really a lonely person.

440
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Come, let's go.

441
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Wen Ning,

442
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
did you hear that?

443
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,340
My sister has a child.

444
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
I have a grandchild.

445
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
Congratulations, Mr. Qi Wei.

446
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
That's great.

447
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Mr. Jin,

448
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,340
the Zou army and the Han Guang army are here.

449
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
I understand.

450
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
You may leave.

451
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
This child.

452
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,340
He is such a warm person.

453
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,340
He is so beautiful.

454
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
No, no.

455
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
Father,

456
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
the second brother and Han Guang army have arrived at Dou Yan hall.

457
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Jin Ling, just let me report it.

458
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
How can you report it?

459
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Can you report it?

460
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Don't make the child fall.

461
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Come on.

462
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
Come here.

463
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Report it.

464
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
You can only report it.

465
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,340
Yes.

466
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Don't report it to anyone.

467
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Don't be anxious.

468
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Don't waste this time.

469
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Han Guang army,

470
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
I didn't hear it right.

471
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Please say it again.

472
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,340
I said,

473
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,340
Jin Ling is full of moon.

474
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Invite all elders.

475
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
Wei Ying is also his elder.

476
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
So you mean

477
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
Wei Wu is his elder?

478
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,340
Even if he is the enemy of the four masters,

479
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
you also invite him here, right?

480
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
I don't know.

481
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
You're not the enemy.

482
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
The enemy?

483
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Is it not the enemy?

484
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Han Guang army,

485
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
are you having a bad memory?

486
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
You forgot to kill Qiong Qi.

487
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Do you want me to remind you again?

488
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Mr. Jin,

489
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
you don't have to forget.

490
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Wei Wu County is not a bad place

491
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
to be buried in the wild.

492
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
After the disaster,

493
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
he was not injured.

494
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
I didn't hear

495
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
that he did anything

496
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
to harm the Xia Yi.

497
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Mr. Zewu,

498
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,340
are you also going to

499
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
do the treason for Wei Wu County?

500
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
I...

501
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
Second brother is here.

502
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm late.

503
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Father.

504
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Zixun,

505
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
what's wrong?

506
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Which family made you angry?

507
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
I will teach him well.

508
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Teach?

509
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
I'm afraid you can't teach him well.

510
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Second brother, this...

511
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Zixun,

512
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
how can you talk?

513
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,340
Hurry up and apologize to Zewu and Han Guang army.

514
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,340
Uncle, do you know

515
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,340
what Han Guang army said just now?

516
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,340
What did he say?

517
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
Han Guang army just suggested

518
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,340
to invite Wei Wu County

519
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
when he was in A-Ling Man Yue Yan.

520
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Although Han Guang army is good,

521
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,340
I'm afraid this is not right.

522
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
In my opinion,

523
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
in Han Guang army's heart,

524
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,340
this is not good enough.

525
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
As far as I know,

526
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Han Guang army used to go to the mess before.

527
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,340
I don't know where Han Guang army went.

528
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
They went to the mess before?

529
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
Yes.

530
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Wei Wu County killed people like horses.

531
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
People are loyal to each other.

532
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
How can you have such an old friend?

533
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
When did you kill people like horses?

534
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Please explain.

535
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
You...

536
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Enough.

537
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
Father,

538
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Wei Wu County is not a big deal.

539
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
It's a lot of people who killed our family.

540
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
However,

541
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
as Han Guang army said,

542
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
he didn't do anything wrong in the past year.

543
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
He has betrayed the Jiang family.

544
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,340
However,

545
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Yan Li still misses him.

546
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
I think

547
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,340
we should take this opportunity

548
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
to summon Wei Wu County back.

549
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Zi Xuan, are you crazy?

550
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Childe Jin, you are right.

551
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
If Wei Wu County has changed

552
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
and returned to the right path,

553
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
that would be a good thing.

554
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
I don't think

555
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
you have heard about

556
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
the evil of the Yiling family.

557
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
Even the soul of the soul

558
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
of the Yiling family is a little bit suspicious.

559
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,340
However,

560
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
although the four families have something to do with this matter,

561
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
it is also the family matter between

562
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
the Jin family and the Jiang family.

563
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
We should still listen to

564
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
what the Lord of Jin said.

565
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
Wei Wu County

566
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,340
is indeed a big deal.

567
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
However,

568
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
as Lord Ze Wu said,

569
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
if Wei Wu County has changed,

570
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
that would be a good thing for all of us.

571
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,340
We should take out a shadow

572
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
and

573
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
we should not

574
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
let the Yiling family

575
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
and the Yiling family

576
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
have any grudge with the previous four families.

577
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,340
Uncle.

578
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
However,

579
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
I don't mind, Lord Jin.

580
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Lord Ze Wu,

581
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
you know

582
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
Wei Wu County

583
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
is not just a person

584
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
who has created a mess.

585
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
There are

586
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
so many Wen family members behind him.

587
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
You know that

588
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
the Yiling family

589
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,340
and the Wen family

590
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
have a grudge with each other.

591
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,340
Good.

592
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
We will not tell you.

593
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
We let the Wen family go.

594
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,340
However,

595
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
he has a piece of

596
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,340
the Yiling family

597
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,340
that can still be controlled

598
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
by the dead.

599
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Moreover,

600
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
that General Wen Ning

601
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
is also a big trouble.

602
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
Father.

603
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
Brother.

604
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
I have a way

605
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
that I don't know if it's possible.

606
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Jiao.

607
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Since everyone

608
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
is concerned about Wei Wu County,

609
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,340
why don't you take a look?

610
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,340
Please go to the Yiling family

611
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,340
and attend the full moon.

612
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,340
When he goes to the Yiling family,

613
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
we will talk about it.

614
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
I will definitely

615
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,340
ask Childe Wei to hand over the Yiling family

616
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
and give everyone an explanation.

617
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
If Childe Wei agrees,

618
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
then why don't you announce

619
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
that Childe Wei is back to the Yiling family

620
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,340
and return to the Yiling family?

621
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,340
Isn't that a good thing?

622
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,340
Ru Ru,

623
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,340
he doesn't agree.

624
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Lord Han,

625
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
why are you so pessimistic?

626
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,340
Childe Wei is not a big trouble.

627
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,340
As long as we talk about it,

628
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,340
I believe Childe Wei will understand.

629
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Moreover,

630
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,340
Lady Jin is close to Childe Wei.

631
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
I'm afraid Childe Wei will be reluctant

632
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,340
to leave

633
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
when he sees Yiling.

634
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Yes.

635
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
Even if he doesn't agree,

636
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
as long as he agrees

637
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
and doesn't kill us without a reason,

638
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,340
even if he returns to the Yiling family,

639
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,340
it's not possible.

640
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
Exactly.

641
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Zixuan,

642
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
are you all right?

643
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,340
That's all, Lord Han.

644
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
As long as we talk about it,

645
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,340
I'll ask you to take care of the iron.

646
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,340
All right.

647
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Really?

648
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Ru Lan,

649
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
you and Xian are going to attend

650
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,340
your full moon banquet.

651
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,340
Are you happy?

652
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Zixuan.

653
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,340
Zixuan,

654
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,340
what's wrong?

655
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,340
What are you doing here?

656
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,340
I know

657
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
you're not as good as you were in the palace today.

658
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,340
But

659
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
you need to understand Father.

660
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,340
He's also doing this for the Four Masters.

661
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Enough!

662
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,340
I don't want to hear you say this.

663
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
All right.

664
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,340
I won't say it.

665
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
Zixuan,

666
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
you and Childe Wei

667
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
are going to be together, right?

668
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Zixuan,

669
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,340
are you

670
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
going to be in the same family?

671
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,340
Zixuan,

672
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,340
are you going to be in the same family?

673
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,340
I'm not going to be in the same family.

674
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

675
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

676
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

677
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

678
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

679
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

680
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

681
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

682
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

683
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

684
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

685
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

686
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

687
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,340
I'm going to be in the same family.

688
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,340
I'm going to be in the same family.
