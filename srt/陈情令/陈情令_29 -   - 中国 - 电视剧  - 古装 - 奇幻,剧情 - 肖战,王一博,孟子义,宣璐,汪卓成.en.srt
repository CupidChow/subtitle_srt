1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 29

3
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,440
Yuan. Yuan.

4
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
- Come here. Come. - No.

5
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
No. I won't

6
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Yuan. You are in his way.

7
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Fine. Let him sit.

8
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,720
Well. Yuan.

9
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,200
You've changed.

10
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Ready to turn to anyone

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,680
for material benefit, huh?

12
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
Brother Xian.

13
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,360
Good. It's good.

14
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,560
You do know what filial piety means. Huh?

15
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,250
Eat without speech.

16
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Don't talk when eating.

17
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,160
Outrageous!

18
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,360
I must repeat myself several times before he obeys.

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Yet you just need to say it once.

20
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,360
Outrageous!

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,350
Eat without speech.

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
You too.

23
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
You didn't change a bit after all this time.

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,720
Why did you come to Yiling?

25
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm familiar with things here.

26
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,920
You want me to be your guide?

27
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,400
Lan Zhan.

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
You are really an awful liar.

29
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,840
You're not coming for me, are you?

30
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,120
Lan Zhan.

31
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
I was gonna ask you to come by my place.

32
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,360
But if you want to talk

33
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,240
something about Qin, meditation and mind tranquility,

34
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,720
then forget it.

35
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
I can control myself.

36
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
I need no one to save me.

37
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,440
Wei Ying.

38
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,640
All right. Lan Zhan.

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,320
I finally met someone I knew from before

40
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
who doesn't try to avoid me.

41
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,840
It's been several very stuffy months.

42
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
Why don't you tell me something

43
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
about what big events happened out there?

44
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,200
"Big events" means?

45
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,720
Like if a new clan appeared somewhere

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
whether a clan expanded its residence

47
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,760
and which clans allied, and so on.

48
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
Chatting, you know?

49
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Anything is fine.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,400
A marriage.

51
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
A marriage?

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Which clans?

53
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
The Jin clan of Lanling

54
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
and the Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
You mean my senior...

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,920
Lady Jiang and Jin Zixuan?

57
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
When will it be?

58
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
When's the ceremony?

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
In half a month.

60
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,000
Such a big event.

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,080
Jiang Cheng didn't even try to find a way to tell me.

62
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,360
However

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,800
even if he'd told me,

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
what could I do then?

65
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,120
Officially

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
Jiang Cheng has announced to the world

67
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
that I defected from the clan

68
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,820
and I had nothing to do

69
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,520
with Jiang clan of Yunmeng any more.

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
What could I do even if he'd told me?

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
It's just that Jin Zixuan got what he desired.

72
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,760
Lan Zhan,

73
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,840
what do you think of this marriage?

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,920
Oh, that's right.

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,880
Why did I ask you?

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,240
It's not like you ever cared about these things.

77
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,070
I know that

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,640
behind my senior sister's back

79
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,670
many say that

80
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,970
my senior sister doesn't deserve Jin Zixuan.

81
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,440
In my eyes, though

82
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
that peacock is the one who doesn't

83
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,440
deserve my senior sister.

84
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,840
Lan Zhan.

85
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
Do you know?

86
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,280
My senior sister, she deserves the best man

87
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
in the world.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
I and Jiang Cheng once said that

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,040
we'll make my senior sister's wedding

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,800
one that everyone praises on mentioning

91
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,800
for a hundred years.

92
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,160
None would be equal to it.

93
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,200
I'll watch my senior sister married with absolute splendor.

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,580
Mn

95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,600
What did you "Mn" for?

96
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
I won't be able to watch it anyway.

97
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,480
Wei Ying.

98
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Oh, no.

99
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,100
Something happened on Burial Mounds.

100
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
Lan Zhan, we have to go!

101
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Lan Zhan? Why are you following us?

102
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,880
Why not maneuver your sword?

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Forgot to bring it!

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,200
Childe Wei.

105
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,680
Yuan. Yuan.

106
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Fourth uncle Wen, what happened?

107
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,400
It's Demon-subdue Cave.

108
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:56,920
Yuan.

109
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,800
Something happened there.

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,360
Didn't I set a restriction there before I left?

111
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
Who changed it?

112
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Nobody!

113
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,800
It was...

114
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
- It was... - Ning!

115
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,480
Ning!

116
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,680
Wen Ning!

117
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,480
I've been using Stygian Tiger Amulet to cure Win Ning.

118
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,280
Hoping it can help him regain his mind.

119
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
It's the last step.

120
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,680
I didn't expect that...

121
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
Ning!

122
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Didn't I say

123
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,360
do not touch the talismans on him?!

124
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Nobody touched them!

125
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
Not a single person went into the Blood Pool Cave!

126
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,160
He suddenly went on a rampage himself

127
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
and ruined both the restriction in Blood Pool Cave

128
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,200
and in Demon-subdue Cave.

129
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,440
Resentful energy in the pool all got released.

130
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,720
Wen Qing!

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You take them away first.

132
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,040
Miss Wen, let's go!

133
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,480
Talisman wall was destroyed.

134
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
No one can stop him now.

135
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,760
We can't let him go down the hill!

136
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,840
Ning!

137
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Ning!

138
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,760
Hanguang Jun,

139
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,360
please go easy on him!

140
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,000
Ning!

141
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,400
Miss Wen. Miss Wen.

142
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,560
Lan Zhan.

143
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Wait a second.

144
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,160
Ch...Childe.

145
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,920
Wen Ning.

146
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,480
Childe Wei.

147
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
Ning. Ning.

148
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,920
Sis...ter...

149
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,240
It's done! It's done!

150
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
Ning, Ning woke up!

151
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Let's go back and tell everyone!

152
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,040
- It's me! - Ning woke up!

153
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
It's your sister!

154
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,520
Ning.

155
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,160
How do you feel right now?

156
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,120
I...I want to cry,

157
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,880
but

158
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,080
I can't.

159
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,920
You just had a nightmare.

160
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
It's all right now.

161
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,720
You did it.

162
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,120
Of course.

163
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,840
I am a man

164
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,200
of my word.

165
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,160
Lan Zhan.

166
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,760
Since you're here,

167
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,720
why not pay a visit?

168
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,880
The Demon-subdue Cave?

169
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,560
That's right.

170
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I came up with the name.

171
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,160
How is it?

172
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,480
I know.

173
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,280
In your heart,

174
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,870
you must be saying "not good".

175
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,440
Actually I picked up some comments out there,

176
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,640
saying that I'm a person who studies crafty tricks

177
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,830
and how could I be so shameless

178
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,400
as to call my den the Demon-subdue Cave?

179
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,760
But they're all wrong.

180
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,640
What I really meant with this name

181
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,440
is not at all what they interpreted it as.

182
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,350
And its meaning is also different from

183
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,200
what the Demon-subdue Palace Xue Chonghai built means.

184
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,160
How come?

185
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,320
Simple.

186
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,760
Just because I sleep here often.

187
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
A cave with a demonic man lying.( "Subdue" can mean "lie" in Chinese)

188
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
Shouldn't it be the Demon-subdue Cave?

189
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,160
Come on.

190
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,560
Let me show you around.

191
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,240
The stygian energy is dense.

192
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,240
That's right.

193
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,480
The stygian energy is dense.

194
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,080
But fit for cultivation.

195
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,880
This is my healing land,

196
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,720
just like your clan's Cold Spring.

197
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,600
Wen Ning used to be here for healing.

198
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,200
But since

199
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,240
the Amulet drew Wen Ning's original resentful energy out of his body,

200
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,920
the water in the pool

201
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
is smelling more and more like blood.

202
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,440
So it's called Blood Pool.

203
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,240
Wei Ying.

204
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,760
What?

205
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
Can you really control it?

206
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,240
Control what?

207
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
You mean Wen Ning?

208
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
Of course I can.

209
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,360
Look,

210
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,280
he's already returned to consciousness.

211
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,040
What if he lost consciousness

212
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,320
again?

213
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
I've been an expert on

214
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,920
dealing with his rampage.

215
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,960
Now he is controlled by Stygian Tiger Amulet.

216
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,240
As long as I could control the Amulet,

217
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,880
nothing will happen to him.

218
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,000
But what if something does happen

219
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
to you or the Amulet?

220
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,560
It won't.

221
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
How could you be sure?

222
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,720
It won't,

223
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,120
and it can't.

224
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,560
You want to keep it this way from now on?

225
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,560
What's wrong with keeping it this way?

226
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,840
Tell you what.

227
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
Don't underestimate this land.

228
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,320
This mountain here

229
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,280
is even bigger than Cloud Recesses.

230
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Our food here taste much better too.

231
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,000
Wei Ying,

232
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
you know what I mean.

233
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,280
Lan Zhan, you...

234
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,760
you really are something out of this world.

235
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,400
I've already avoided the topic

236
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,680
and you pulled it back again.

237
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
Your injuries.

238
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,240
No need.

239
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,880
Why use spiritual energy for such a small wound?

240
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,400
I can just sit here and it'll heal itself.

241
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,480
It'll heal itself?

242
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,760
You took me dead?

243
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,480
Childe Wei.

244
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,520
Childe Lan.

245
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Why are you here?

246
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
Finished crying so soon?

247
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,280
Just watch how I'll make you cry later!

248
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,840
What a joke!

249
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,840
Just by yourself?

250
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
You... You're so cruel.

251
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,560
Wei Ying!

252
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
I have crueler things.

253
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
Do you wanna see?

254
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,960
Spare me please.

255
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,120
I wouldn't want to try that.

256
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,360
Childe Wei.

257
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,040
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,800
Enough, enough.

259
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
You really thought you can hurt

260
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,280
me with a punch like that?

261
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,440
Wait a minute.

262
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,640
What's going on?

263
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
How can you let a guest drink plain water?

264
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,120
Where is tea?

265
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,440
I asked just now

266
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
and they said there's no tea.

267
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,800
That's so inappropriate. Wen Ning.

268
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The next time a guest comes over, we must prepare...

269
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,520
Right.

270
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
We won't have more guests?

271
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,120
Let's go.

272
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,600
I'll see you off down the hill.

273
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,040
Lan Zhan,

274
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,320
you asked me if I intended to

275
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,520
keep it that way from now on.

276
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,400
To be honest,

277
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,800
I'd also like to ask what I can do

278
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
except this?

279
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,200
Give up on the crafty tricks

280
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,760
and surrender the Stygian Tiger Amulet?

281
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,440
Then what about the people on this mountain?

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
Turn them in?

283
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,880
I can't do that.

284
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,320
I believe that if you were me,

285
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,480
you couldn't do that either.

286
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,960
Can anybody give me

287
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,200
a nice, favorable choice.

288
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,720
A choice that I could protect those I want to protect

289
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,000
without studying

290
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,080
the crafty tricks

291
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,920
and using the Stygian Tiger Amulet.

292
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,000
Lan Zhan.

293
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,760
Thank you.

294
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,320
Thanks for your company today.

295
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,800
And thanks for telling me

296
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,400
that my senior sister's gonna marry.

297
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,280
But,

298
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,800
let the self judge the right and wrong,

299
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,560
leave others' comments aside,

300
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,360
and care little about gain and loss.

301
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,240
What I should do.

302
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,240
I know it very well.

303
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,120
I believe that

304
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
I'll be able to control it well.

305
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
Big brother!

306
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,320
You don't stay today

307
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,880
to eat with us?

308
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,040
Childe Wei. I'm sorry.

309
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,080
Yuan himself...

310
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,920
Yuan, come here.

311
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,920
Come on.

312
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,560
Yuan.

313
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,240
Yuan.

314
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,720
This brother has food back in his own home.

315
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,640
He won't be staying.

316
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,280
But...

317
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Yuan heard a secret.

318
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,200
They said that there'll be lots of tasty food today.

319
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Yuan.

320
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm leaving.

321
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,240
Brother Xian,

322
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,640
would Brother Rich ever come here again?

323
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,800
Who's Brother Rich?

324
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,160
The rich brother is Brother Rich.

325
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,920
You really like him that much, huh?

326
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
- Give it back! – Try to get it. Try.

327
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Give it back!

328
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,040
He bought it for me!

329
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,000
No. I won't give.

330
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,680
Unless you say that you like Brother Xian.

331
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,000
I like Brother Xian.

332
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,200
Okay. Here it is.

333
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,760
Brother Xian.

334
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,800
Will Brother Rich come back again or not?

335
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,160
Probably not.

336
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,920
Why?

337
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,320
There's no why.

338
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,360
In this world,

339
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,440
everyone has their own things to do,

340
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,040
their own paths to walk.

341
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,320
Who cares about the crowded, broad avenue?

342
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,560
I'll stick to my single-log bridge till it's dark.

343
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll stick to my single-log bridge till it's dark.

344
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,440
...till it's dark.

345
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,040
My single-log bridge...

346
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,800
Dark?

347
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Not dark at all.

348
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,520
= Demon-subdue Palace =

349
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,400
There's no hurry.

350
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,280
Everyone has food.

351
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,360
Thank you. It's enough.

352
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,320
Why are everyone still awke?

353
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,840
Is that enough for you?

354
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,520
Have some more.

355
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,720
Meat!

356
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,280
Here comes the Childe.

357
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,320
You hung so many lanterns today.

358
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,520
Isn't that too costly?

359
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
We hung them for you.

360
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,400
We'll make more tomorrow to hang them along the mountain path.

361
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,520
If you rush around in the dark all the time,

362
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,600
you'll slip and

363
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,200
break your bone someday.

364
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,920
Why not sit?

365
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,280
OK. Let's sit down.

366
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,640
What?

367
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,680
Haven't started yet?

368
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,440
No.

369
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
We were waiting for you.

370
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,600
Why did you wait for me?

371
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,400
These past few days, you've worked hard.

372
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,440
You're suddenly talking so nicely to me.

373
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,520
I'm kind of scared?

374
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,960
In fact,

375
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,120
they all wanted to have a dinner with you,

376
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,720
so that they could thank you.

377
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,000
But you're either jumping up and down, running around,

378
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,840
or shut inside the Cave

379
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,120
and staying in there for days upon end,

380
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,440
not letting anyone disturb you.

381
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,400
They didn't want to hold up your work

382
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
and annoy you.

383
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,920
They thought you didn't like interacting with others

384
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,240
and didn't want to talk to them,

385
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,360
so they were too embarrassed to talk to you.

386
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,760
Now Ning woke up,

387
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,160
and everyone was busy celebrating.

388
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,040
So they didn't have time talking to you.

389
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,360
It's fine even if you don't eat.

390
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Just sit here with everyone,

391
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,240
and we can chat and have a few drinks.

392
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,000
Come on. Have a seat.

393
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
Okay. Sit. Sit.

394
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,840
Drink?

395
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,200
There's liquor up here?

396
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah. There's.

397
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,640
Here.

398
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,840
Fruit wine,

399
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,840
made from the wild fruits on this mountain.

400
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,320
Have a try.

401
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,560
Fourth uncle likes drinking.

402
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
He knows how brew by himself

403
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,280
and made them especially for you.

404
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,440
He's been trying for many days.

405
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,360
Really?

406
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Then I have to try some!

407
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,000
It really is rich!

408
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,440
Good! Give me another bowl!

409
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,760
You made

410
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
all these dishes?

411
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,280
It's Ning.

412
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Ning.

413
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,960
Brother Coal! Brother Coal!

414
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Come on. Everyone.

415
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,560
Bottoms up!

416
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,920
To Childe Wei. To Childe Wei.

417
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,160
Come on.

418
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,920
Drink up.

419
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,120
Come on, please.

420
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,880
Come, eat.

421
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,120
Fourth uncle, come on.

422
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,760
Drink it.

423
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,520
Good!

424
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Fourth uncle, one more.

425
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
You can't drink any more?

426
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,720
Come on.

427
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,360
No. I can't.

428
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,440
No? That's what you got?

429
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Wen Qing.

430
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,440
There's no more wine.

431
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,040
There are four more bottles. We can save them for later.

432
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,120
You can call it a day for now.

433
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,840
How could this be?

434
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,600
People say

435
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,680
that a good name after death can't compare

436
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,760
to some good wine when living.

437
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,520
A full cup, please.

438
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,720
There's no next time.

439
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,320
I really think you should quit drinking.

440
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,520
You drink way too heavily.

441
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,160
It's not like it's the Cloud Recesses here.

442
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,840
Why should I quit drinking?

443
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,040
Wen Qing.

444
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,120
The first time I met Lan Zhan

445
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,440
is when I brought Emperor's Smile

446
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,160
into Cloud Recesses.

447
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,040
What a pity that you didn't see his face

448
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,960
his stony face.

449
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,880
But

450
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
Emperor's Smile of Gusu

451
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,640
is really delicious.

452
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,080
I wonder if there's a chance

453
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,000
to drink it again.

454
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,480
I'm good for nothing.

455
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,600
I promised my senior sister that I would help her

456
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,600
hold the most splendorous wedding in the world.

457
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
But now

458
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,160
I can't even attend the wedding.

459
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,480
I am completely useless.

460
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
I am completely useless.

461
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,440
I am completely useless.

462

486
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
Do you know that?

487
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,720
If you go further into the mountain

488
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,040
you'll be in the Burial Mounds.

489
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,800
Burial Mounds?

490
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
Isn't the place where Wei Wuxian,

491
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,600
the traitor of Jiang clan and who calls

492
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,720
himself Yiling Patriarch lives?

493
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,600
Yeah.

494
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,720
Do you want to die?

495
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
How dare you go further?

496
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,120
Wei Wuxian had made the strongest

497
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,520
puppet, Wen Ning.

498
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Yeah.

499
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
It was said that Wen Ning was not only

500
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,440
incomparably fast and strong

501
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,720
but on top of that,

502
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
its consciousness was preserved.

503
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,680
It's much more powerful than the walking corpses made by Wen clan.

504
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
No wonder it is called Ghost General.

505
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,240
Dude, I suggest you that

506
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
you'd better not go.

507
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,720
What if Wen Ning...

508
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,880
There's something you don't know.

509
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
Wei Wuxian has created his own crafty tricks,

510
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
including

511
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
Compass of Evil, Flame Talisman and so on.

512
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,680
They're very novel.

513
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,000
I heard that many people have become his disciples.

514
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
I also want to broaden my horizon.

515
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,720
Attention please,

516
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,120
everybody.

517
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm the Chief Disciple of Yiling Patriarch Wei Wuxian.

518
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,880
Today I'm here to show you my newly designed talisman.

519
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,530
= Yiling Patriarch the Supreme Lord =

520
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,370
= Yiling Patriarch the Supreme Lord =

521
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,880
Everybody.

522
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,040
This is

523
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,120
the Flame Talisman which won't be quenched by stygian wind.

524
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,200
A must-have item for staying at home or going on travel.

525
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,480
It only costs one silver coin.

526
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,960
I want one. I want one.

527
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,640
Give me one.

528
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Give me one. I'll have one, too.

529
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,280
Hey, hey, hey. Don't rush,  everybody.

530
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,000
Wait a moment.

531
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,480
Give me one.

532
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,200
With such little trick like Flame Talisman

533
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,920
you wanna go in the name of Yiling Patriarch

534
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
to bluff people?

535
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,240
Buddy.

536
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,000
How shameless you are!

537
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,000
Awesome!

538
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,480
Who is the true disciple of Yiling Patriarch?

539
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,400
He is really professional!

540
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,240
Who are you?!

541
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,080
Who am I?

542
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,400
I just got out of the Burial Mounds.

543
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,400
I never saw that my master

544
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,600
has accepted a disciple like you.

545
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,400
You mean I'm fake?

546
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,280
I think you're fake!

547
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Look, everybody.

548
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,840
These are my master's newly invented

549
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,440
talisman tools.

550
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,240
It's not something like Flame Talisman.

551
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,920
Don't be fooled. Everyone.

552
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,400
You're talking nonsense!

553
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,800
Nonsense?

554
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,480
Well, you can show me the evidence.

555
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,480
Don't be fooled by him.

556
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,720
He's a liar.

557
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,080
Who is the liar?

558
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,880
I believe everybody knows it.

559
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,920
Liar, I'm the Chief Disciple of Yiling Patriarch!

560
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,960
I am!

561
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,000
By using such small tricks,

562
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,960
how dare you impersonate the disciple?

563
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,080
Don't go! Believe me.

564
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
I am the Chief Disciple!

565
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
I am the Chief Disciple!

566
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,520
He's a liar!

567
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,000
These are my master's latest inventions!

568
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,320
What are they talking about?

569
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,240
Don't believe this liar, everybody!

570
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,560
Let's go.

571
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,050
= False =

572
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,200
Here you are.

573
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,480
What happened? What's going on?

574
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,160
Is he all right?

575
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,000
Childe Wei! Childe Wei!

576
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,240
Are you injured? Are you okay?

577
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,000
Are you all right?

578
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,120
What's going on?

579
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,000
What's up?

580
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,200
Don't worry.

581
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,280
I'm fine.

582
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,160
Just a little accident.

583
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,800
Everyone can go back.

584
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,880
Go on with your work.

585
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,440
Don't look at me any more. Go to work.

586
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
Let's continue our work.

587
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,560
What strange thing are you working on?

588
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,040
Compass of Evil.

589
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,360
It's very powerful.

590
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,400
Go to buy some meat.

591
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,480
This is all the money?

592
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,000
Take this bag of turnips

593
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,560
and sold it.

594
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,120
Wen Ning

595
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,160
Sorry!

596
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,640
Let's go.
