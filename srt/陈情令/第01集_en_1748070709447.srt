00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The End

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Episode 14

3
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Wei Wuxian is dead!

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What a happy man!

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good!

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What a happy man!

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If it wasn't for the great destruction of the world,

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the people of Lanling and the Jin clan,

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and the three of you,

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we wouldn't be able to destroy the people of Yiling

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and Wei Wuxian!

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes!

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yunmeng Jiang clan was trying to take him away,

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but I didn't expect that he would be a traitor!

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He is good!

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He is a traitor!

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He is a traitor!

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The Jiang clan is almost dead!

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If I were Jiang Cheng,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I would have killed him!

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I am the Yihu Manor!

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Jiang clan is almost dead!

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I am the Yihu Manor!

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The Jiang clan is almost dead!

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The Jiang clan is almost dead!

26
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Lan Zhan.

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let me go.

28
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Jiang Cheng.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wei Wuxian!

30
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You go to hell!

31
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Speaking of Wei Wuxian,

32
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
16 years ago,

33
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
he was the first emperor of the Xian family

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to be the emperor of the Xian family.

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He was less than a year old,

36
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and he was not as good as a man.

37
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But what was the end of his life?

38
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He was the first emperor of the Xian family,

39
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but he was the last one to be the emperor.

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He was the last emperor!

41
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Uncle,

42
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
if you say so,

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
does the Yiling Clan Wei Wuxian

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
have died or not?

45
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The cliff must have fallen down.

46
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But in these 16 years,

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the Jiang clan and the Jiang clan

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
have changed the cliff.

49
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They have not found his body.

50
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The rumor is true.

51
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The Yiling Clan has a place to live in

52
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and is capable of climbing the sea.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So,

54
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
even after 16 years of peace,

55
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
who can be sure

56
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that the Yiling Clan Wei Wuxian

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
will not return to the city

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
today?

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The Yiling Clan Wei Wuxian

60
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The Yiling Clan Wei Wuxian

61
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The Yiling Clan Wei Wuxian

62
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
will not return to the city today.

63
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's all right.

64
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have a poison.

65
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The Yiling Clan Wei Wuxian

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wuxian

67
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Wuxian

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who is he?

69
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Wuxian

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Who is he?

71
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wuxian

72
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wuxian

73
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wuxian

74
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who is Wuxian?

75
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Wuxian is you.

76
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I owe you a thousand thousand dollars.

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
From now on,

78
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you are Wuxian.

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, I am not.

80
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I am not.

81
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have no other way.

82
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't want to be with you.

83
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But

84
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
they are too much.

85
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Kill them.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Kill them.

87
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Wei Wuxian

88
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
will not return to the city.

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Wei Wuxian

90
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hurry up.

91
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's go.

92
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Who is it?

93
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's the boss.

94
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You are so ridiculous.

95
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
How dare you report to the police?

96
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you think I am really afraid of you?

97
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You think you can't?

98
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Who do you live in?

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Who is the boss?

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Who is the boss?

101
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What's wrong with you?

102
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's my fault.

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sir, it's all over.

104
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So fast?

105
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Did you find the door?

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This broken house

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
has everything here.

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Only a few broken houses

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
can protect it.

110
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's been years since Lanlin's death.

111
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are so selfish.

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You are not like a dog.

113
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You are so fast.

114
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
As your cousin,

115
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I advise you.

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't be like your mother.

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Just like your dream.

118
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A man is a man.

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can't be like the phoenix in Lanlin's world.

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Sir, the ancestors of the broken house are in the town.

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Madam asked you to come.

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

123
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mo Xuan Yu.

124
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I am alive.

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why did you save me?

126
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You still have a serious wound.

127
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How big is your wound?

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I am not a human.

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I am a human.

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I am a human.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I am a human.

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am a human.

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I am a human.

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How big is your hatred?

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's true.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The ancestors of the broken house

137
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
are so kind and generous.

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They are suitable for others.

139
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
One stab and one life.

140
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If his enemies are not dead,

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
these wounds will never heal.

142
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I should have died.

143
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You...

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What?

145
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mo Feng, who asked you to come out?

146
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Go back.

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I am Mo Xuan Yu.

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You are not Mo Xuan Yu.

149
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I tell you.

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't be like that.

151
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Even if you are very stubborn,

152
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you can't change your mind.

153
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Why didn't you wear your mask today?

154
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I have been wearing my mask.

155
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Feng Zi, while you are awake today,

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
tell me.

157
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What happened to you?

158
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Why did you go to the Golden Bell Tower?

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How did you become like this?

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You are not a bandit.

161
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What?

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You are not a bandit?

163
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How old am I?

164
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
13 years old.

165
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why do you ask?

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Nothing. I am leaving.

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Where are you going?

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Come back.

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I will kill you.

170
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I will kill you.

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's not delicious even if you are born 16 years ago.

172
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know what I have been doing lately.

173
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I have killed many people.

174
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I have considered to send you here.

175
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This way, please.

176
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why are you so stubborn?

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Mo Xuan Yu just saved me.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And Gu Su Lan Shi came.

179
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Did he come too?

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Thank you for coming to our Mo's House to kill me.

181
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I have heard that Gu Su Lan Shi is a good person.

182
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He is very generous.

183
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Today,

184
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Guo Zhen is very famous.

185
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He is very famous.

186
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, yes.

187
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's said that

188
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
our Mo's House is a good person.

189
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's not as common as others.

190
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Our Mo's House has a younger sister.

191
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She has been a good friend of our family.

192
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If we can have more fun here,

193
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
our Mo's House...

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Here!

195
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Who told you to call me?

196
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The most important person in our Mo's House is us.

197
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Who let him out?

198
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hurry up and get him back.

199
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's go!

200
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I...

201
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I won't go!

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I won't go!

203
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I won't go!

204
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I won't go!

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I won't go!

206
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let go of my hand!

207
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let go of my hand!

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I won't go!

209
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't pull me! Let go of my hand!

210
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let go of my hand!

211
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let go of my hand!

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hurry up and go!

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I won't go back!

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let go of my hand!

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
My nephew is very ill since he was a child.

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Please don't laugh at me.

217
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mo Xue, you're crazy.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hurry up and go!

219
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Or I'll clean up the house.

220
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
A'Tong, take him away!

221
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can go, but you can give me back the stolen stuff.

222
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Nonsense!

223
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When did I steal your stuff?

224
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I stole your stuff!

225
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes, you didn't steal it.

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're a robber!

227
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm so sorry.

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm so sorry.

229
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Come and see for yourself.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I won't go back.

231
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
My wife is very ill since she was a child.

232
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
She's been in the family for 70 years.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No, I didn't hear that.

234
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, I didn't hear that.

235
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Mo Xue is not the one who stole it.

236
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Mo Xue is the one who stole it.

237
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Moreover, she's also a daughter-in-law of Mo's family.

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
She's a very good girl.

239
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, when she came back,

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
she was so good at it.

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She was a little crazy.

242
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, yes.

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're crazy!

244
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Who's going to stop you?

245
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let me have a drink.

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Give me back the stolen stuff.

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Or you can give me a few boxes of wine.

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Look at Cheng He's drinking with me.

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You're all seen?

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You stole things and hit people?

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's so cold in here.

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This young master,

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
please say something.

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Mr. Cheng,

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
this is my sister's son.

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's a little bit hard to make him.

257
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The Mo family knows about it.

258
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He's always been a weirdo since he was a child.

259
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's been a weirdo since he was a child.

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He's a weirdo.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He's always been a weirdo since he was a child.

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He's always been a weirdo.

263
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
He can't be serious.

264
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Who said I can't be serious?

265
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let me tell you again.

266
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you dare to steal my stuff,

267
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll break his hand.

268
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you hear me?

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Stop it!

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm leaving, everyone.

271
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

272
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Good bye, everyone.

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What's wrong?

274
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Mrs. Mo,

275
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
it's urgent.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The Western Courtyard of the Banshee House is in use tonight.

277
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Please remember,

278
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
don't come out again after you're done.

279
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't come near that yard.

280
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, yes.

281
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Thank you.

282
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mother,

283
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
this bastard is so mean to me.

284
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's not true.

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You said he's just a weirdo.

286
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Shut up.

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This bastard is dead.

288
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Please excuse me.

289
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What's wrong with him?

290
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Is he really going to destroy the whole Mo family?

291
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Please.

292
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Please.

293
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Zhao Yingqi?

294
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Come here.

295
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Take us to the western Courtyard.

296
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You go to the eastern Courtyard.

297
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We'll go up and check.

298
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Try to put these Zhao Yingqi

299
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in the Mo's house.

300
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
After the disaster...

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The whole family was shouting at me.

302
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But the things that were done by the Yiling family

303
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
were all done by Zhao Yingqi.

304
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
By then,

305
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
if they come from the eastern Courtyard,

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
we'll attack them from the east.

307
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Be careful.

308
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Don't move the people in the Mo's house.

309
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And,

310
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
the long-haired men here

311
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and the roof over there

312
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
will be sent to help.

313
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Keep the alert at any time.

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Please don't be disturbed by the evil spirit.

315
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What are you doing?

316
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is not the place you should come.

317
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't move.

318
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is not the thing you should take.

319
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, no, no.

320
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
No, no, no.

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I want this.

322
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I want this.

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you want it back?

324
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll beat you.

325
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't want it back.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't want it back.

327
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I want it back.

328
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Please.

329
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Forget it.

330
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Take it back.

331
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Don't be so stubborn.

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I didn't hit him.

333
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Look at him.

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He's got the flag.

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The Wen clan is right.

336
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The Zhou clan is not.

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There's no mistake.

338
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There's no mistake.

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The flag is not enough.

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The talisman

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
can only attract

342
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the most impoverished.

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But it's useful.

344
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Mr. Mo, it's getting dark.

345
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The horse is about to catch the evil spirit.

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You should go back to your room.

347
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's dangerous at night.

348
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
No matter what you hear at night,

349
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
please don't come out.

350
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Mr. Mo, what's wrong?

351
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You just broke the flag.

352
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Who's in the West Sea?

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My painting is better than theirs.

354
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're really crazy.

355
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Don't be so stubborn.

356
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I think we should

357
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
do our own thing.

358
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's go there.

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Look over there.

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The flag

361
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
should be here.

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Over there?

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes.

364
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Mr. Mo,

365
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
we must not go out.

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We can't come to the West Sea.

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How can we find the flag?

368
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Go.

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Bring the black flag over here.

370
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But Mr. Mo...

371
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He's afraid that

372
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
someone will steal the flag.

373
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So he's trying to get it.

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Look at the flag.

375
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Everyone is holding the black flag.

376
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Hurry up.

377
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Hurry up.

378
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Young Master,

379
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
we've got the flag.

380
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's go.

381
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Jingyi,

382
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
the song is so familiar.

383
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:37,880
It's like a

384
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
song.

385
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Lan Zhan.

386
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Take it out.

387
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Take it out.

388
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Yes.

389
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
What the hell?

390
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Hit him.

391
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Yes.

392
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
It hurts.

393
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Go.

394
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Be gentle.

395
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
What's wrong?

396
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I don't know.

397
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Oh, no.

398
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
I've never seen a Mo Xunyu

399
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
who grew up.

400
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
But he's from the Gu Sulan family.

401
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Don't you recognize me?

402
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
What should we do?

403
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Mr. Zhao,

404
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
why don't you get up first?

405
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Xishi.

406
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Gu Yulun.

407
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
What should we do, Master?

408
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
No.

409
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Yulun.

410
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
It's you.

411
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
It's you.

412
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
It's Xie Sui.

413
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
It's not that simple.

414
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Look at the black pattern on his neck.

415
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
What's the special mark?

416
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
No.

417
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
It's been two people

418
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
who have been killed

419
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
in the middle of the night.

420
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Xie Shi is dead.

421
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Mrs. Mo.

422
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
He killed my son.

423
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
What's the point of killing me?

424
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Your son has become like this.

425
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
It's none of my business.

426
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Mrs. Mo.

427
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
The death of the master is

428
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
the same as the death of the master.

429
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
It's not what you think.

430
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
What do you know?

431
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
The father of this lunatic

432
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
is the nine-star.

433
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
He has learned a lot of martial arts.

434
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
I...

435
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Mrs. Mo.

436
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
I have no evidence.

437
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
So...

438
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Evidence?

439
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Doesn't my son have evidence?

440
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
This lunatic said

441
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
as long as we

442
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
touch his things,

443
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,880
he'll break his arm.

444
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Unfortunately,

445
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
we didn't steal anything from him.

446
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
He didn't only frame my son,

447
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
but also hurt him.

448
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
You can't live without a seat.

449
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
You dare to steal this kind of stuff.

450
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
No wonder you can't come up with anything.

451
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Father.

452
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
My daughter.

453
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
What did you do to my son?

454
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Don't worry.

455
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
He just got married.

456
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
You're useless.

457
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
I can't live without him.

458
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
You're useless.

459
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
You're useless.

460
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
You're useless.

461
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
You're useless.

462
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
You're useless.

463
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
You're useless.

464
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
You're useless.

465
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
What's wrong with you?

466
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
What's wrong with you?

467
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
You can't even protect a child.

468
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm not...

469
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
You really think you're a slave?

470
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
You're so sensitive

471
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
to being kicked out of the house

472
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
and being kicked out of the house.

473
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm asking you, my dear.

474
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
You should be 20 years old.

475
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Why can't you understand?

476
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Did you tell him last night

477
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
not to touch anything here?

478
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Don't go to the Western Courtyard.

479
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
He's a good man.

480
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
He's a thief.

481
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
It's his fault.

482
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
It's my fault.

483
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
You...

484
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Go.

485
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Go and get him.

486
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Why are you standing there?

487
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Go.

488
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Go.

489
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
What are you doing?

490
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
You're in trouble.

491
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Get out of here.

492
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Lan Yang, let's go.

493
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Get out.

494
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Go, father.

495
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Go.

496
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Ding.

497
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Go and rest in the room.

498
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Go.

499
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Go and rest.

500
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Go.

501
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Go.

502
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Go.

503
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
My lady.

504
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
What is this?

505
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
It's a bloodbath.

506
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Send a signal to Lord Han.

507
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Lord Han?

508
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Are you saying Lord Han is a slave?

509
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
But Lord Han didn't tell us

510
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
where he went before.

511
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Wait.

512
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Are you saying Lord Han is nearby?

513
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
No.

514
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Send a message first.

515
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Wait.

516
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
Don't bother Lord Han.

517
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
What if we can't wait?

518
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
We don't know anything.

519
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
I said don't bother Lord Han.

520
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I can solve it.

521
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Wait.

522
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Wait.

523
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
I said...

524
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
It seems that we have to fight.

525
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Yes.

526
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
These black patterns

527
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
are the traces of the Eagle Tiger's clothing.

528
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
But the Eagle Tiger's clothing is destroyed already.

529
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,880
What exactly is the evil here?

530
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
A'Tong, you're awake.

531
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Your Majesty.

532
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Look at that bag.

533
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
No!

534
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Ghost!

535
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Ghost!

536
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,880
I can't see anything.

537
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880
It's him! It's him! A'Tong killed himself!

538
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
No ghost.

539
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Don't talk!

540
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Their left hand is broken.

541
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
You're crazy.

542
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
You can't laugh at this?

543
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
No, no.

544
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Stop it. No one cares about you.

545
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
He's not Mu Ziyuan's father.

546
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
That's not A'Tong.

547
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Why?

548
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Look at his hand.

549
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
They're not left-handed.

550
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Every time he hits me, I use my right hand.

551
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I know this very well.

552
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
What are you so proud of?

553
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
You're so proud of yourself.

554
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Yes, the evil spirit is in their left hand.

555
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Please raise your left hand.

556
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
No.

557
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
He's afraid of our safety.

558
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Take off your clothes.

559
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
No.

560
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Get up.

561
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Get up.

562
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
No.

563
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
No.

564
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Ziyan!

565
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
A' wrote on your head.

566
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
He plays my famous villain.

567
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
No.

568
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Oh, man.

569
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

570
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

571
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,880
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

572
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

573
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

574
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,880
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

575
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

576
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Lord Han Guang!

577
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Lord Han Guang!

578
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
What is the evil spirit doing?

579
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
It's so dangerous!

580
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
It's not the evil spirit.

581
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
It's a spirit of a spirit.

582
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
It's hidden in the sword.

583
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
It's a sword spirit.

584
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
A spirit?

585
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Why does it have such a big wish?

586
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Lord Han Guang!

587
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
This is...

588
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
The Tiger-Headed Manor?

589
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
The Tiger-Headed Manor?

590
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,880
You mean there's a trace of the Tiger-Headed Manor in the sword?

591
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,880
The Tiger-Headed Manor is destroyed in the night sky.

592
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Could it be...

593
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Could it be Lord Yiling?

594
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
He's not dead yet?

595
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Where's Lord Mo?

596
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Wei Ying.

597
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Is it really you?

598
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Lord Mo.

599
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Thank you, Lord Mo.

600
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,880
I didn't expect that you would give such a gold to the three-day Yiling Clan.

601
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
You're so talented.

602
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Lord Mo.

603
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Lord Mo.

604
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Lord Mo.

605
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Lord Mo.

606
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Who will be the last one to take the last step?

607
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Lord Mo.

608
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Lord Mo.

609
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
Lord Mo.

610
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Lord Mo.
