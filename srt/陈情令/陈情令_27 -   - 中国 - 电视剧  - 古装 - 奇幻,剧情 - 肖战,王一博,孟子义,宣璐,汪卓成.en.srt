00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 27

3
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,200
You need to think again.

4
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,640
If you go,

5
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,320
you'll rebel against orthodoxy for real,

6
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,160
with no way back.

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,160
Rebel against orthodoxy?

8
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,640
What kind of orthodoxy is that?

9
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,080
Lan Zhan,

10
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,120
do you still remember

11
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
the promise we have made together?

12
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,320
I wish I, Wei Wuxian,

13
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
could eliminate the evil and help the poor for my life,

14
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
and have nothing to be regret.

15
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,120
I wish I could eliminate the evil and help the poor for my life.

16
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,680
But tell me now that

17
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,280
who's stronger and who's weaker,

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,040
and who's right and who's wrong.

19
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,160
Wei Ying!

20
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
Is this the promise that we pledged our lives to keep?

21
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
I only regret that I didn't stop the Jins

22
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,720
who took living people as baits in the Crowd Hunt.

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,920
Otherwise, Wen Ning won't come to such end.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,760
I have missed a chance to save him.

25
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
At this time,

26
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,600
I won't give it up anyway.

27
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,720
Besides,

28
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,040
I must save him.

29
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,720
Lan Zhan,

30
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,280
If I have to fight with them finally,

31
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,200
I'd prefer to fight with you.

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
If I am doomed to death,

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,080
at least,

34
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,880
I could be killed by you.

35
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,360
That would be worth it.

36
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,360
Hya!

37
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,520
Hya!

38
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,080
Hya!

39
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,120
Hya!

40
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,160
Hya!

41
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,240
Hya!

42
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
Where is it?

43
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
This place? The Burial Mounds.

44
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,720
This... Can people live here?

45
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Why can't?

46
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,320
I once lived here for three months.

47
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
We are old friends now.

48
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,840
Follow up.

49
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
Follow up.

50
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
= Pageant Hall =

51
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,400
Even that seclusive old predecessor Lan comes .

52
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,400
I knew things would turn out in this way.

53
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Let's see how it ends.

54
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,320
Guangyao,

55
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,880
you

56
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,440
tell all clan leaders here,

57
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,760
what Wei Wuxian did.

58
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
This time, in the Qiongqi Road,

59
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,680
Wei Wuxian,

60
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,280
he made Wen Ning into a puppet

61
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
who killed a lot of people.

62
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,120
There are four overseers killed,

63
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,240
and about fifty remnants of Wen clan fled.

64
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,280
Having led them into the Burial Mounds,

65
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,000
Wei Wuxian took the Demon-Subdue Palace of Xue Chonghai,

66
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,520
and set many barriers at the mountain foot.

67
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,800
Our people

68
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,880
can't step into the region.

69
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,160
He's really making a big trouble this time.

70
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,880
On this matter, his method was nowhere near proper.

71
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,920
I apologize on behalf of him to Jin clan of Lanling.

72
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,440
If there is any remedy,

73
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
please tell me directly.

74
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,320
I will try my best to do it.

75
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,680
Clan Leader Jiang Cheng,

76
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
for your sake,

77
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,360
I shouldn't speak too much on this.

78
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,080
Yet, these overseers are not only from our Jin clan,

79
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,840
but some from the other clans.

80
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
Right?

81
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,040
Yes.

82
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,520
Wei Ying also killed people in our clan.

83
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,840
Right!

84
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,640
Although Clan Leader Jin is so generous that he may let it pass,

85
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,080
we can't.

86
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
My friends, you may not know that

87
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,480
the Wen's cultivator whom Wei Wuxian wanted to save that day

88
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,560
is called Wen Ning.

89
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,480
He and his sister Wen Qing

90
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,240
helped us a lot in Sunshot Campaign.

91
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,160
Hence...

92
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,960
What do you mean they helped you?

93
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,520
Wen clan of Qishan,

94
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,600
aren't they the murderers who massacred you Jiang clan?

95
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,240
I know a few about Wen Qing and her brother.

96
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,480
They came to the lecture in Lan clan before.

97
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
Their temperament

98
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
is indeed distinct from the others of Wen clan.

99
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,160
Although I haven't met them again,

100
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,000
they didn't kill or assist killing anyone

101
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
in Sunshot Campaign.

102
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,720
Neither did they participate in nor did they stop the others.

103
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,560
They seem to be trusted fellows beside Wen Ruohan.

104
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,600
Even though Wen Qing is his trusted fellow,

105
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,720
how could she be capable of stopping him?

106
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,480
Since they were silent and didn't stop him,

107
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,360
when Wen clan committed their crimes,

108
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,960
they can be thought as cold watchers.

109
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
How can they enjoy the favor

110
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
when Wen clan was in power,

111
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
but bear no burden and pay no price

112
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
when Wen clan collapsed?

113
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
What Clan Leader Nie said is right!

114
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,720
Since Wen Qing was a trusted fellow beside Wen Ruohan,

115
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,000
if people say that

116
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,280
she didn't participate in the whole case,

117
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,080
I won't buy it.

118
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,600
None of Wen clan is clear of some murders.

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,680
Maybe it is that we haven't discovered it yet.

120
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,360
Agreed!

121
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
These underlings of Wen clan

122
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
aren't allowed to survive!

123
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
Helping the Wen clan

124
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
is to be an enemy against us.

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,520
Yes!

126
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,480
Right!

127
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,960
Clan Leader Jiang,

128
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,800
since this should be your family affair,

129
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,960
I'm not supposed to say these words,

130
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,880
but

131
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,520
as for Wei Ying,

132
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,280
I have to remind you.

133
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,640
Please.

134
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,040
Wei Ying is your trusted assistant.

135
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,280
He is important to you.

136
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,640
We all know that.

137
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,600
But on the contrary,

138
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,360
it's hard to say,

139
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
whether he respects you as a clan leader.

140
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
Being a clan leader so many years myself,

141
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,600
I haven't seen any subordinate

142
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,000
that can be so proud and self-centered before his master.

143
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,880
Do you know how outside people comment that?

144
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
In Sunshot Campaign,

145
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
all your achievements that today

146
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,720
were made by Wei Wuxian alone.

147
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Isn't it ridiculous?

148
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
Right.

149
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,360
Clan Leader Jin asked Wei Ying to hand in the Stygian Tiger Amulet

150
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,640
out of kindness.

151
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
He is afraid that Wei Wuxian can't control it well

152
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,520
which may lead to a disaster.

153
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,640
Yet Wei gauged a heart of a gentleman with his mean measure.

154
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,560
Does he think that everyone covets his spiritual tool?

155
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
So ridiculous!

156
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
As for spiritual tools,

157
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,440
every clan have a few their own.

158
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,400
That's right.

159
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
Besides,

160
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
no one knows where did his Stygian Tiger Amulet come from.

161
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,920
- Right. - Yes.

162
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,120
There were four shards of Yin Iron.

163
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,640
When it is brought up,

164
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,120
the last one hasn't been found yet.

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,320
Xue Yang has stolen that shard from Chang clan of Yueyang.

166
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
We were all present at that time.

167
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,120
From Yueyang to Qinghe,

168
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,800
who knows whether

169
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,560
Wei Ying colluded with Xue Yang secretly or not?

170
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,320
- Why don't you think about it?
- Yes. You are right!

171
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,960
Who made that Wen cultivator into a puppet?

172
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
Don't bring it up again!

173
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
This Wei Wuxian,

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,080
it's OK for him to have suspected me of desiring his spiritual tool

175
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,880
but he is a member of Jiang clan

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,480
and was helped by Jiang family.

177
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,480
Yet he refused to obey Clan Leader Jiang's order so many times.

178
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,960
At such a grand occasion as the banquet that day,

179
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,280
to everyone's face, he fell out

180
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,080
with us suddenly

181
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
and left irresponsibly.

182
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,680
Behind you,

183
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,120
he even told the other people at Mount Phoenix

184
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,080
that he did never take Clan Leader Jiang seriously.

185
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,480
People here all heard it!

186
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,560
- Yes! - Yeah!

187
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,120
No, I didn't!

188
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
What did you say?

189
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,520
I never heard Wei Ying say that,

190
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,920
neither did I see

191
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,640
he showed any disrespect to Clan Leader Jiang.

192
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,240
Really?

193
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,840
That day at the Phoenix Mountain Crowd Hunt,

194
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
Childe Wei was so aggressive

195
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,200
and he said many words,

196
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
one more shocking than another.

197
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,400
Maybe he said something similar.

198
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,240
I just can't recall it clearly.

199
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,520
Right.

200
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,120
He's always arrogant

201
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,880
and often say some rampant words.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,080
We all know

203
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
that Second Childe Lan and Childe Wei

204
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,400
are close friends in daily life.

205
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,120
I heard if Second Childe Lan

206
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,320
didn't free him on purpose in the Qiongqi Road that day,

207
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
Wei Ying couldn't have fled away that easily.

208
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,280
I have these words in mind for so long that

209
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Wei Wuxian,

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,480
though had some merits in Sunshot Campaign,

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,600
but there are more courtiers who earned more merits than him.

212
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,560
None of them

213
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,800
is so proud of himself as he did.

214
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,840
I thought he's problematic far before.

215
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,680
Never study the decent tricks,

216
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,320
but crafty tricks,

217
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,160
and fiddle with those messy talismans.

218
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,240
I knew things would go wrong soon or later.

219
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,120
See?

220
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,440
his brutal nature of killing has been exposed.

221
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,080
He has indiscriminately killed so many our men

222
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
just for those underlings of Wen.

223
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,720
Not indiscriminately.

224
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,800
What do you mean by saying that, Miss?

225
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,480
No, I have no other meaning

226
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,800
and I just thought the word "indiscriminately" is inappropriate.

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
Why is it inappropriate?

228
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Ever since the start of Sunshot Campaign,

229
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,760
Wei Wuxian has been fond of killing randomly.

230
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,480
Can you deny that?

231
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,040
Sunshot Campaign is a battle.

232
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
On the battlefield, can we say

233
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,160
everyone can count as killing indiscriminately?

234
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,000
Now let's focus on this specific case,

235
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,280
if those overseers who were killed

236
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,320
really had abused prisoners

237
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
and had got Wen Ning killed.

238
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,560
This can't be called indiscriminate killing then.

239
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I disagree!

240
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,280
Then we should justify

241
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,240
his killing our people?

242
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Shall we praise it as chivalry?

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Yeah!

244
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,480
We don't even know

245
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
whether those overseers did that or not.

246
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,400
Besides, no one saw it personally.

247
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,400
Yeah!

248
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,590
Those overseers who survived

249
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,880
all said that they never abused prisoners.

250
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,110
And it's Wen Ning himself

251
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
who fell off from the cliff accidentally.

252
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,760
They even helped to cure him out of kindness,

253
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,830
but they never thought they would be revenged so brutally.

254
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,310
It's so bitterly disappointing!

255
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,400
Those overseers

256
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
are afraid to bear the responsibility of killing and abusing prisoners.

257
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,760
Surely they would insist that they are innocent

258
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
and Wen Ning fell off himself.

259
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,120
Miss Luo,

260
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,800
I think you are saying chicanery

261
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,720
with a guilty conscience, right?

262
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
Clan Leader Yao,

263
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,160
please explain what do you mean

264
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,880
by "with a guilty conscience" ?

265
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,400
Shall I explain?

266
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,120
You know it very well.

267
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Don't waste time with her.

268
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,280
How could she even be a member of Jin clan.

269
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,560
I feel ashamed standing with her.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Fine.

271
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,880
You all speak loud.

272
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,360
You all make sense.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,960
Such being the case,

274
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,120
I will secede from the clan.

275
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,400
Clan Leader Jiang Cheng,

276
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,040
I think Wei Wuxian has planned this for long

277
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,680
that they went to Burial Mounds this time.

278
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,680
After all, with his capability now,

279
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,800
it is not that difficult for him to build his own clan.

280
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,560
He wants to take this opportunity

281
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,080
to develop his own section and become unrestrained.

282
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,040
Clan Leader Jiang Cheng,

283
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,440
you rebuilt Jiang clan with hard efforts.

284
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,240
Wei Wuxian has always been a controversial character.

285
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
And he keeps making trouble for you.

286
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,680
It may be that he didn't respect you at all,

287
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
and never think about your feelings.

288
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
No.

289
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,920
That's his character since childhood.

290
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
Even my father couldn't change that.

291
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,440
Did brother Fengmian really have no method?

292
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
As for brother Fengmian, he was partial to him.

293
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,000
Clan Leader Jiang Cheng,

294
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,640
you are different from your father.

295
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,040
You have just rebuilt Jiang clan for several years.

296
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
It's time for you to build up your authority.

297
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,480
Yet,

298
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,840
he has no intention to defend your authority

299
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,920
and never considers this.

300
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,840
What would your new disciples think

301
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
if they saw it?

302
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,760
Should they take him as their role model

303
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
and defy your authority?

304
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,040
Clan Leader Jin, that's enough.

305
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,920
I will go to Burial Mounds myself

306
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
to end the issue.

307
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,120
That's the wise decision.

308
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,400
Clan Leader Jiang Cheng,

309
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,040
Dealing with someone and something

310
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,640
you can't be too generous with them.

311
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,920
As for the ominous Stygian Tiger Amulet...

312
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,360
I will ask him to hand in

313
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,880
and give everyone an account.

314
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,320
Well, you all hear that!

315
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,480
So poor is the table of Clan Leader Jiang.

316
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,240
Even the cup was crushed by him with hand.

317
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,240
It seems he is really angry.

318
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,000
Second bro,

319
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,560
where is Wangji?

320
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,440
I saw that he left in advance.

321
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,080
This girl really has her backbone.

322
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,480
Yeah!

323
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,680
Yet,

324
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,640
it's really difficult to deal with this issue of Childe Wei.

325
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
This Childe Wei,

326
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,440
is so capable

327
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,760
that he could even resurrect the dead?

328
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
According to the overseers,

329
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,880
Wei Wuxian did make the dead Wen Ning into a puppet.

330
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
Wei Ying,

331
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
you really messed this up.

332
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
But the case of Yin Iron isn't clear yet.

333
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,320
Maybe Childe Wei didn't do it.

334
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,640
If it weren't him, then who could it be?

335
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Wei Ying,

336
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,840
he depends on his capability

337
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,880
and refused to follow the righteous course.

338
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,760
You,

339
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,960
have to take him as a warning.

340
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,600
Yes,

341
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,560
I will follow your words.

342
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,080
Wangji,

343
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
have you regretted?

344
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
When you stole into the forbidden chamber of Library Pavilion,

345
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,920
I didn't punish you

346
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,520
for I wish you could be self-retrospective.

347
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,240
You should have gone to the Qiongqi Road

348
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,240
and let Wei Wuxian and his fellows go!

349
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,720
Should you make one mistake after another?

350
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,360
What's the use of the family disciplines that

351
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,440
I have asked you to recite?

352
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,600
Answer me,

353
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,640
what's the fifty-second clause

354
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
of the family disciplines?

355
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,400
No association with the evil.

356
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,160
Did you forget your father's lesson?

357
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,960
My mother, she...

358
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,800
Hold your tongue!

359
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,880
Wangji,

360
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,360
I have been taking care of you since you were a child,

361
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
and I always take you as my own son.

362
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,040
I am always strict with you

363
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,800
because I wish

364
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,880
that you can stick to the right path.

365
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,840
I don't want you

366
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
to repeat your father's tragedy.

367
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,480
That's what I want to say to you.

368
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
I hope you can choose a right path yourself.

369
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,560
Now you may leave.

370
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm taking a walk.

371
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,240
Childe Jin.

372
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,040
Lady Jiang.

373
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,280
Childe Jin,

374
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
I have to find my brother.

375
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Excuse me.

376
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,680
I don't mind!

377
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,160
Lady Jiang,

378
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,360
I,

379
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,120
I know what happened today.

380
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,320
But this is Wei Wuxian his own business.

381
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,200
Childe Jin,

382
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,720
as for involving you in this mess,

383
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm so sorry.

384
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,360
Tomorrow,

385
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,400
tomorrow I and Cheng

386
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,240
will leave Jinlintai.

387
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,120
You'll leave?

388
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
Where are you going?

389
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
The Burial Mounds?

390
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
Would you please not go there?

391
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,360
Lady Jiang,

392
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,960
please stay here,

393
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,320
stay in Jinlintai.

394
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,000
No matter how people slander you,

395
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
trust me,

396
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,200
I will take care of you for my whole life.

397
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,320
Senior sister!

398
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,480
Wei Wuxian.

399
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,920
Wei Wuxian.

400
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,000
Wei Wuxian.

401
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,080
Wen Qing,

402
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,600
you scorched it again.

403
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,880
Wei Wuxian,

404
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,960
why didn't answer

405
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
when I was calling.

406
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,040
You know that we have stayed here for three days and nights.

407
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,440
Why you still ask?

408
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Still taking much.

409
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,400
Don't eat it then.

410
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,880
Don't snatch.

411
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,120
By the way,

412
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,200
he can hear words now.

413
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,000
Talk more often with him,

414
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,720
he may wake up earlier.

415
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
Ning,

416
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,000
can you hear me?

417
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,880
Ning.

418
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,000
Fourth uncle.

419
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
Childe Wei,

420
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,000
shall we reclaim the whole

421
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
barren land today?

422
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,080
Yeah.

423
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
Only in this way can we grow the crops well.

424
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,840
This. This.

425
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,040
Yuan, quit it.

426
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,460
Speak! Speak!

427
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,550
= Wen Yuan =
Speak! Speak!

428
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:35,800
Speak! Speak!

429
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,200
Fine. Put your hands away.

430
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,920
Put away...

431
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,560
Here you are. Go play with this.

432
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,280
Yuan,

433
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,040
if you still follow me in this way

434
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,080
I will plant you in the field as the turnip.

435
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,400
Yuan!

436
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,320
You really want to be a turnip.

437
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,320
Fine! Then stay still.

438
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
If you move, I won't plant you.

439
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,280
There you go!

440
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,560
I plant a big turnip today.

441
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,880
After several days,

442
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,920
many turnips will grow out.

443
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,560
Then everyone can eat to his heart's content.

444
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,800
But I'm not the turnip.

445
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,840
Then we plant a child here.

446
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,240
If we water the child, apply fertilizer to him

447
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,560
and let him enjoy the sun often,

448
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,160
we can grow many children.

449
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,560
I want three elder brothers

450
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,320
and two elder sisters.

451
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,240
No problem.

452
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
We'll give Yuan three elder brothers

453
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,640
and two elder sisters.

454
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,840
Will they look like me

455
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,320
or the turnips?

456
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,960
That's hard to say.

457
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,480
Do you want them to look like you

458
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,640
or the turnips?

459
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,680
Wei Wuxian,

460
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,200
what are you doing?

461
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,640
Aunt,

462
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,720
we're trying to grow some elder brothers and sisters here.

463
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,120
Yuan,

464
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
how about growing more aunts?

465
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,760
If we grow more aunts

466
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,040
then we won't be wanting in the labor force.

467
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Get up. Come.

468
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,960
Wei Wuxian,

469
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
I just left for a while.

470
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,080
How could you

471
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,520
plant Yuan in the soil?

472
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
It's fine that you can't help work,

473
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,080
but how can you make trouble?

474
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
I haven't washed the clothes

475
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,000
he got off yesterday.

476
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,080
You messed up his clothes again.

477
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
What should he wear tomorrow?

478
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,440
You should wash all his clothes today!

479
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,680
Washing clothes is women's job.

480
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,720
How can a man like me do disgrace that divine job?

481
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,600
Wash or not?

482
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
Fine. Fine. Fine.

483
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,880
Clan Leader.

484
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,710
How's it?

485
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,880
Surrounding the Burial Mounds, there are walls of talismans.

486
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,120
We can't step into it.

487
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,600
You people wait here.

488
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,230
Let me have a look first.

489
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,400
Clan Leader,

490
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,480
you may be in danger to go there alone.

491
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,520
Potatoes!

492
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,400
Turnips!

493
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,720
I dislike turnips. I want potatoes.

494
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,840
Turnips grow well and won't wither easily.

495
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
No, potatoes.

496
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,160
I said turnips, then we grow turnips.

497
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,960
Childe Wei.

498
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,840
Here you come, Jiang Cheng.

499
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,480
Tell me,

500
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,840
it's better to plant potatoes or turnips?

501
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,320
Why you look at me?

502
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,840
Back to work.

503
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
What are you doing?

504
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,200
Can't you see it?

505
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Building a house.

506
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,720
Building a house?

507
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,520
Then during the way I came up

508
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,920
what are those diggers doing?

509
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,840
Don't tell me that you want to grow foods!

510
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,600
You already saw it.

511
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,240
They are going to grow foods there.

512
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
You want to grow foods on a mountain of corpses.

513
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,160
Can the foods be eatable?

514
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,600
Believe me,

515
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,560
when people are extremely hungry

516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,280
they will eat anything.

517
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,120
You really want to station here in long run.

518
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,360
Can people live in such a terrible place?

519
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,920
I once lived there for three months.

520
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,640
No returning to the Lotus Cove?

521
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
Since Yunmeng and Yiling are close to each other

522
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,880
I can steal back anytime I miss Yunmeng.

523
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,640
Daydream!

524
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,440
Where is this child from?

525
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,440
Get off me!

526
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,440
Get off?

527
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,840
Can you use the words correctly?

528
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,400
Yuan,

529
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,080
how can you hold the leg of whoever you see?

530
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,240
Don't put your hand which just touched the soil into month!

531
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,920
Do you know what kind of soil it is?

532
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Come here. Come here. Come here.

533
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,120
- Where's grandma? - Yuan.

534
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,920
Come here.

535
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,560
- Go to grandma. - Come here.

536
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,160
- Grandma. - Come here.

537
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,200
Run slowly.

538
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
Play with grandma.

539
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,080
Those clan leaders

540
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,320
thought that you have gathered a group of remnant rebels

541
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,280
to throne yourself in the mountain swaying some flags.

542
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,880
It turn out to be a group of the old, the young and the weak.

543
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,120
All useless!

544
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,560
All useless?

545
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,400
Can't you speak in a good manner?

546
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,760
Where's Wen Ning?

547
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,120
Why you ask for him suddenly?

548
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,120
These days many people came to me to ask about him.

549
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
Who can I turn to when they come to me?

550
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,920
I can only come to you.

551
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,280
What do you want to do?

552
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,600
Don't worry.

553
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,400
Jiang Cheng come here to meet the old friend.

554
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,040
He won't do anything to him.

555
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,200
He just calms down.

556
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Don't disturb him.

557
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,080
I know.

558
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
After entering it, don't make noises.

559
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,040
Fine. Fine.

560
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Why are you still waiting?

561
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,080
Let's go.

562
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,720
Don't trample on it!

563
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
This is useful to me.

564
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,680
It will be finished soon.

565
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,560
Don't trample on that!

566
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,000
This is also useful.

567
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,760
To be finished soon.

568
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,720
You threw them all over.

569
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,040
You can't blame who would step on them.

570
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,000
I live alone here.

571
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,400
I feel like scattering them. So what?

572
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,960
You really...

573
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
You live in such place?

574
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,600
Wen Ning.

575
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,680
Wen Ning.

576
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,760
Someone came to see you.

577
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,720
He can hear it actually.

578
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,320
Why is he in this condition?

579
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,920
People said,

580
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,000
the dead who you resurrect will become fierce

581
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,480
and kill people without blink.

582
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,440
Resurrection?

583
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,720
Where is the people I resurrected?

584
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,800
Ning's part of spirit was snatched by the Dancing Peri when he was a child.

585
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,240
Hence he was taken as a rare bait

586
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,760
by some vicious men to attract the evil.

587
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
When we found him

588
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,480
he was corrupted by the evil.

589
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,760
Pulse stopped.

590
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,840
He had only the last breath.

591
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,920
I just wanted to give Jin clan a lesson through Wen Ning

592
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,320
by using the power of Stygian Tiger Amulet.

593
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,160
It didn't come to me that

594
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,840
he would become the puppet

595
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
and lose his mind.

596
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,040
Could he slaughter others just because he lost his mind?

597
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
Wen Ning was introvert and coward.

598
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,800
He often hid his emotions.

599
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,600
When he lost his mind

600
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,680
those pain, fury, anxiety and uneasiness

601
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,200
hidden inside his heart

602
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,880
all erupted out.

603
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,440
How is him now?

604
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,640
Now,

605
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,960
I try to call his consciousness back.

606
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,680
You're having bats in your belfry again.

607
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,240
Can he count as a human now?

608
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,800
What's his difference from those

609
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
puppets we killed?

610
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,880
Wei Wuxian,

611
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,800
was that really you?

612
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,560
Jiang Cheng,

613
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,760
you too suspect I took that shard of Yin Iron?
