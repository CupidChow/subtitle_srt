00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 11

3
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Meng Yao.

4
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,160
Are you OK, Meng Yao?

5
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,880
From now on,

6
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
I can't take care of you anymore, my childe.

7
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
Childe, you need to work harder.

8
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,760
Do not make Clan Leader angry any longer.

9
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,840
What?

10
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,640
Clan Leader has ordered

11
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,400
I must leave Yet Clean Field at once.

12
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,520
Why?

13
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Clan Leader has made up his mind.

14
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
Farewell.

15
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,760
Brother,

16
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,120
Meng Yao said you drove him out of the door.

17
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,760
What on earth is going on here?

18
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,320
- Brother... - Sit down.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,760
Where is your manner?

20
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,280
Clan Leader Nie,

21
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,640
Childe Meng is injured.

22
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,480
And I wonder what mistake has he committed.

23
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
I am afraid if he is drove away like this...

24
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
Do not mention it again.

25
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Childe Jiang and Childe Wei,

26
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,070
What is your move next?

27
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,640
Now the situation in Cloud Recesses bodes ill rather than well,

28
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,560
besides, Lan Zhan is on the way back to Cloud Recesses.

29
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,800
I am afraid that he may encounter danger, too.

30
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,320
Wei Wuxian,

31
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,280
nowadays, Wen clan sends people in charge of indoctrination.

32
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,120
Wen Xu has gone to Cloud Recesses.

33
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,040
and it is unknown who has gone to Lotus Cove.

34
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
Right.

35
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,920
So let's come back to Lotus Cove quickly.

36
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,080
Yes.

37
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,160
Now Wen clan has sent out its gangsters.

38
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,320
You two need to go back to Lotus Cove as soon as possible.

39
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,280
As for Xichen,

40
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,920
The best thing I could wish is his safety.

41
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
Wait for me. Wait for me.

42
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,720
- Childe Jiang is back. - Childe.

43
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
Childe is back.

44
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Childe.

45
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,120
- Childe Jiang is back. - Childe.

46
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,960
Hi, Childe Jiang and Wei. Hello, Childe..

47
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,240
- Hi, Childe Jiang. - Hi, Childe Jiang.

48
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Childe Jiang.

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
Childe.

50
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
Hi, Childe Jiang, Childe Wei.

51
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,840
Come and see.

52
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,480
Childe Jiang and Wei are back.

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,960
Long time no see, Childe Jiang and Wei.

54
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
Right, Uncle.

55
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
How about your business recently?

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,520
Good, good.

57
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
By the way, Uncle.

58
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,280
Is there anything strange in Yunmeng recently?

59
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
There is nothing strange

60
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,160
other than some unfamiliar faces.

61
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,920
It is said that some smaller clans around here

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,840
want to go to Clan Leader for shelter.

63
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,800
I don't know the details.

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,400
Stay. Don't go.

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,200
Come here. I got fresh lotus seedpods.

66
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,240
Take a bag of it with you.

67
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Thank you, Uncle.

68
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,680
Remember to have a cup of tea with me.

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,760
- Childe. - Childe is back.

70
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
I've missed you so much.

71
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you take something delicious for us?

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,640
Childes are back. Childes are back.

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,840
I will go to tell the lady.

74
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,000
Lady. Lady.

75
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
Lady.

76
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,800
What's up?

77
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,720
You are in such a rush.

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Childes are back.

79
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,160
Are Xian, Cheng back?

80
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,600
Tell me, this time we went out without permission,

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,480
will dad punish us?

82
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,840
In my opinion, chances are we will be punched by him.

83
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,760
It's all your fault.

84
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,600
What were you running around for?

85
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,200
or else I wouldn't go out to search you.

86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,160
My mistake.

87
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,320
later I will bear the punishment for you.

88
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,720
Come on.

89
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,280
I have been with you since I was a child.

90
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
Since when I don't get punched

91
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
as I have a brother like you?

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
I don't know what sin did I commit in another life.

93
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,040
Thanks very much.

94
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,880
Don't be angry.

95
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,200
In afterlife, let's still be brothers, is that OK?

96
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,080
Shut up.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Uncle Jiang.

98
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,225
It's me who broke the rules and went out without permission

99
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,040
which was why Jiang Cheng went out, intending to find me.

100
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,670
Please punish me, Uncle Jiang.

101
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
Dad, I am not filial

102
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,720
for making you worried.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
Cheng, Xian

104
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,080
Have you got hurt

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
or encountered any danger in the journey?

106
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,760
Dad...

107
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Uncle Jiang, it is our bad

108
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,200
for making you concerned.

109
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,280
Dad,

110
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
we were not going out for fun this time,

111
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
instead, we were with Lan Wangji...

112
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
Xian, Cheng.

113
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,160
- Senior sister. - Sister.

114
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,920
Do you miss me, senior sister?

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,720
Sister, ignore him.

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,160
Sister, how are you there days?

117
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,000
Senior sister must be missing me.

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
You has lost weight because of it.

119
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
Shame on you.

120
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,240
Enough. Enough.

121
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,640
Don't chatting.

122
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,640
Let's eat first.

123
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,640
Sure.

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,040
Come and sit.

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Where is my mom?

126
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,200
Your mom is a little tired.

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240
We start first.

128
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,420
Who says I am tired?

129
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,790
=Yu Ziyuan, Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

130
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
Mom.

131
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Since you come, just sit and have the meal.

132
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,520
The children are hungry.

133
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
I told them to eat first.

134
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,760
All of you, sit down.

135
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,920
It is not the right time to be hungry.

136
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,440
In a few days when they are in Qishan

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,280
whether they can eat or not remains unknown.

138
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,200
They better go hungry for a while now

139
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,280
to get used to it.

140
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,360
No matter what will happen in the future

141
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
it is necessary to have meals today.

142
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,120
Mom,

143
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
are we really going to accept indoctrination in person?

144
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,440
Ask your dad.

145
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,480
Here is the thing.

146
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Presumably

147
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,160
you have heard about it in Qinghe.

148
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,680
Wen clan of Qishan has also sent special envoy to Yunmeng

149
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,920
urging all the clan

150
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,280
to send their family juniors to go to Qishan within 7 days.

151
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,440
They will offer indoctrination in person.

152
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,040
Cheng, Xian,

153
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,280
I was going to explain it to you.

154
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,560
These days you two should prepare for it and set off.

155
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,600
Offer indoctrination in person?

156
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,880
It is what Wen clan said?

157
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
Such a shame on them.

158
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,040
Watch your language and enjoy your meal.

159
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,280
Thank you, senior sister.

160
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
How can you be so calm?

161
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,640
Why are you so anxious?

162
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,080
Anxious?

163
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,840
How can you be

164
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,360
so calm and unconcerned?

165
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
The letter said

166
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,760
if we ever dare to disobey their order

167
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,240
and refuse to give them

168
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
our clan heirs,

169
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,760
we will be accused of

170
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,080
treason against the gentry and harm to all the clans.

171
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,480
Then we will be wiped out.

172
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,280
How arrogant!

173
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,320
What does it mean clan heirs?

174
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,520
Namely, either Cheng or Li

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,040
has to be at their mercy.

176
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,840
Why do we sent them away?

177
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Indoctrination?

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,280
Since when it is Wen clan's turn to step in

179
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,880
when we indoctrinate our own children?

180
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,320
It is obvious that we send our own children to be treated

181
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
as hostages.

182
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,400
Mom, do not be pissed off.

183
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll go, that's it.

184
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Of course it is you.

185
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,840
How could it be your sister.

186
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,440
Look at her

187
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
peeling the lotus seeds with pleasure.

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Stop it, Li.

189
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,420
Who are you peeling the lotus seeds for?

190
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
You are the master

191
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
not a myrmidon of someone else.

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,680
Milady.

193
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,920
What?

194
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,600
What did I say anything wrong?

195
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,400
Myrmidon,

196
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,360
not willing to hear that?

197
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
Jiang Fengmian, I ask you

198
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,640
are you going to send him this time?

199
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,080
It's up to him.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
He can go if he wants to.

201
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
I'll go.

202
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
How nice!

203
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,240
He can go if he wants to.

204
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,680
He doesn't want to go, he stays.

205
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
So why does our Cheng go without other choice?

206
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,880
You raise a son for others like this?

207
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,160
Clan Leader Jiang,

208
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,600
you are such a kind person.

209
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,840
Milady,

210
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,320
I believe you are tired

211
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,800
and it is time to take a break.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
- Mom. - Don't you ever call me!

213
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,320
You want to tell me to shut up

214
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,720
like your dad?

215
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,600
You idiot!

216
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,080
I tell you

217
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,880
in your whole life

218
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,680
you are nothing compared with that guy sitting beside you

219
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
no matter for cultivation or night hunt.

220
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,840
Now you are even the one to seek your doom first.

221
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,240
But it's not your fault,

222
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,480
your mom is no match for his mom.

223
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,760
It is what it is.

224
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,480
But I am not reconciled for you.

225
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,720
How many times have I told you?

226
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
Do not mess up with him.

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,120
How could you say a good word for him?

228
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,240
How can I have a son like you?

229
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,360
Fine. Let's eat.

230
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,920
Wen Zhuliu.

231
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Lan Zhan.

232
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,160
You are always arrogant,

233
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,280
but now you still end up in my hands.

234
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,440
What about this?

235
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
You kneel down

236
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,800
and hand in Yin Iron

237
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
I will not kill you.

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,760
You know what?

239
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,440
What I disgust most

240
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
is your patronizing tone.

241
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,760
Who the hell do you think you are?

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,080
You are merely an tiny ants on the foot

243
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,440
of Qishan Mountain.

244
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,320
Wen Zhuliu, beat him!

245
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,830
Shit.

246
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,880
No doubt, it is Devil Scatter Spell created by Wei Wuxian.

247
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,680
Just paper tigers.

248
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,760
Keep chasing?

249
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,520
No.

250
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,000
Let him go.

251
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,080
My brother has arrived Cloud Recesses .

252
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720
It is better to give him a look

253
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,680
what ruins has Cloud Recesses become.

254
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,080
How long will a tiny ant keep its arrogance?

255
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:45,875
Kill!

256
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,920
=Wen Xu, Wen clan of Qishan.

257
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:53,080
Kill!

258
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,300
Come here!

259
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,080
Besiege Cloud Recesses!

260
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Don't even let a flying sneak in.

261
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,960
Clean the house! Clean the house!

262
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,480
Clan Leader,

263
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
Wen Xu has encircled every entrance of the mountain

264
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
with his people.

265
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,600
He says he will set a fire and burn the mountain to the ground.

266
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Uncle.

267
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
Wen clan of Qishan

268
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,240
is sinister and vicious, sure enough.

269
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,760
Uncle,

270
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,840
there is fire poison in Wen Xu's Red Fire Talisman.

271
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,600
Do not be angry.

272
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Where is Wangji?

273
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Have you contacted him?

274
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
You have to contact him.

275
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,160
Ask him to leave as soon as possible.

276
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Never ever come back.

277
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,560
If he hides outside,

278
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,840
there are chances that we can keep...

279
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,960
Uncle

280
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,600
Clan Leader. Clan Leader.

281
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,480
Something bad happened.

282
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:26,775
- Outside!  - Lan clan juniors,

283
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
face danger fearlessly.

284
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,040
Do you still remember what I have taught you before?

285
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,720
Zewu Jun,

286
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Wen clan has gone around the mountain and broken the wards.

287
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,480
They set fire everywhere.

288
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,480
The fire is nearly expanding to

289
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,080
the houses where inner disciples live.

290
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,040
Uncle,

291
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
now the urgency is clear.

292
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,760
Lan clan may face a devastating disaster.

293
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,120
With all due respect

294
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,360
I beg uncle to take the ancient books in Library Pavilion

295
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
and  leave the Cloud Recesses.

296
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,000
Clan leader!

297
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
If I leave,

298
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
what about you?

299
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,440
what about the rest of you?

300
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,080
We will retreat to the Cold Pond Cave.

301
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,320
Without headband, they cannot get in.

302
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,720
Uncle.

303
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,720
It is urgent.

304
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Please look at the big picture.

305
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,000
No matter what, we have to save the foundation of Lan clan.

306
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,115
Xichen.

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,760
Please do not say another word.

308
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,280
You go

309
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,280
and I'll stay.

310
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,480
Uncle.

311
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,240
If you still consider me your uncle,

312
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,800
go now.

313
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Uncle,

314
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,920
I am the master of Lan clan.

315
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,480
I swear I will never leave Cloud Recesses.

316
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,480
It is because you are the master that

317
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
you should be the one to leave.

318
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Only if the ancient books aren't destroyed

319
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,840
and the master doesn't die,

320
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,200
the Lan clan of Gusu is not eliminated.

321
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Uncle.

322
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,280
Pass my order,

323
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:41,345
all the inner disciples

324
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,440
bring outside disciples to the Cold Pond Cave.

325
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,400
Dad.

326
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,400
It's you two.

327
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
What?

328
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
What's up? It's so late.

329
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,400
Uncle Jiang,

330
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,000
the reason Wen clan is so rampant now

331
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,760
might have something to do with us.

332
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,080
It is a long story.

333
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,240
I am afraid that I will start

334
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,960
from the day when we took lectures in Lan clan.

335
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,040
On the way we came back from Qinghe

336
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,920
I've kept sending messages to Lan Zhan

337
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,920
but had never got his respond.

338
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
Nowadays Wen clan

339
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,840
becomes increasingly rampant

340
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,360
and reveals its original malicious appearance.

341
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
They tend to do bad things without fear.

342
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
They rob things when they can't steal.

343
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,120
I am worried will Cloud Recesses...

344
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,320
Actually

345
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,160
I have been long aware of what you have said.

346
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,840
You have known it for a long time?

347
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,480
Is it when we were taking lectures?

348
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,720
What Clan Leader Lan worried about is right.

349
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,360
We just did not expect

350
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,840
Wen clan would do evil this brazenly.

351
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
When you are in Qinghe

352
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,240
Clan Leader Lan sends another letter.

353
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,600
It says

354
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,040
Lan clan has become a thorn in the Wen's flesh for Yin Iron.

355
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,900
Wen Xu has gone to Gusu.

356
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,400
It may not be as simple as

357
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,880
giving order and indoctrination.

358
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,320
What about us?

359
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,120
Will Wen clan attack us?

360
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,800
Now although Wen clan is strong,

361
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,920
Clan Leader Lan said

362
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,040
refining Yin Iron is extremely complicated.

363
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,480
Yin Iron will control people when refined carelessly.

364
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,560
Therefore, before Wen Ruohan gets stronger,

365
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,200
they will not send people to siege and suppress various schools,

366
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,520
in case of a counterattack.

367
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,640
While Lan clan is deeply involved with Yin Iron

368
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,200
now they cannot keep a low profile any longer.

369
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Cheng, Xian.

370
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,960
Delay always brings danger.

371
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,560
You start off together in three days.

372
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,560
But...

373
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,720
I know I am making it hard for you.

374
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,280
Uncle Jiang, I understand.

375
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,400
The situation is stronger than people now.

376
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,760
When we arrive Qishan,

377
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,680
we will definitely take care of ourselves.

378
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
As for that Wen Chao,

379
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,560
he at most gives us two punches when pissed off.

380
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,000
But he dare not kill us.

381
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,360
To attempt the impossible.

382
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,680
Do nothing until you achieve something.

383
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,720
How many people are out there?

384
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,040
All the disciples are scattered by Wen clan.

385
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,080
I can't contact them.

386
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,800
There should be dozens outside.

387
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,000
Master, let's get in quickly.

388
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
I wait here.

389
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,920
Master.

390
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,840
Lan Qiren.

391
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,040
Master Lan. Master Lan.

392
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
Kill them!

393
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,440
Uncle, go.

394
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,720
Kill!

395
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,680
kill!

396
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,200
Everyone keeps up.

397
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,000
How to get in?

398
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,240
I... I am a peripheral disciple.

399
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,920
I don't know.

400
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,560
Listen, Lan Wangji!

401
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Hand out Yin Iron,

402
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,200
or

403
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,920
I will kill all the disciples

404
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,360
in Cloud Recesses.

405
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
I ask again.

406
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,720
How to get in?

407
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,200
Say!

408
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,720
Headband! Headband!

409
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,280
All the inner disciples are equipped with headbands.

410
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,040
The cloudy figure on it is Lan clan's stamp.

411
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Only the inner disciples making a mudra can get in.

412
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,840
Su She, you are such a coward.

413
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,040
How can a black sheep like you appear in Lan clan .

414
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,880
So hard to find a informer.

415
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,280
Go. Keep saying.

416
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,320
Where is Lan Xichen?

417
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,480
He... he has escaped with ancient books.

418
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,520
Wangji.

419
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,280
Uncle.

420
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,200
It is here that

421
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,240
predecessor Lan Yi told me

422
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,120
we should keep our conscience clear.

423
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,440
Thank you so much.

424
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,920
I will surely give you a handsome reward.

425
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Lan Wangji,

426
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,080
you finally come out.

427
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,560
Let them go.

428
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,440
Retreat from Cloud Recesses.

429
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,520
Where is Yin Iron?

430
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,760
Retreat from Cloud Recesses.

431
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,320
I will go to Qishan.

432
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,000
OK.

433
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,840
Set him free.

434
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,760
By the way,

435
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,600
aren't you very powerful?

436
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,600
Come,

437
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,280
break one of his legs.

438
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,680
Senior brother, fighting!

439
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,920
He can't shoot that.

440
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,160
Of course he can.

441
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Where is the kite?

442
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,440
Senior brother, fighting!

443
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,040
Fighting! Fighting!

444
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
He's great!

445
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,280
So he is.

446
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
Senior brother, go!

447
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,160
Fighting!

448
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,560
Senior brother, go! Go! Senior brother, go!

449
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,640
It's so close.

450
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,000
So close.

451
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,880
Right.

452
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,840
It has gone so far.

453
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,160
Can you shoot it?

454
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,880
You guess.

455
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,800
Senior brother, go!

456
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,280
Senior brother, go!

457
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,000
Senior brother, go!

458
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,680
Childe Wei, go! Childe Wei, go!

459
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,200
Wei Ying, fighting!

460
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,520
Good! Sure enough senior brother is the best!

461
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,120
Good! Good! Well shoot!

462
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,280
Sure enough senior brother is the best!

463
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,440
Even if you are in Qishan, Wen clan is nothing to you.

464
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,640
Give them a lesson.

465
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,520
Let them know

466
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,320
Jiang clan is not a soft touch.

467
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,400
It won't be as easy as today to shoot under their sun.

468
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,200
It is nothing but

469
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,840
to attempt the impossible.

470
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,200
Your Excellency. Your Excellency, mercy! mercy!

471
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,360
I am guilty.

472
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,560
I will never do it again.

473
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,040
Your Excellency, mercy. Your Excellency.

474
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,720
Your Excellency, mercy.

475
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,160
I will never do it again.

476
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,840
Mercy, mercy, Your Excellency.

477
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,840
I will never do it again.

478
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,040
I am guilty.

479
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,320
I will never do it again.

480
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
Your Excellency, mercy.

481
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,720
Your Excellency, mercy. Your Excellency, mercy.

482
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,920
I am guilty.

483
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,480
I will never do it again.

484
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
I will never ever do it again.

485
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,600
Your Excellency, mercy. Your Excellency, mercy.

486
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,680
Your Excellency, mercy. I shall never do it again.

487
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,520
Mercy, Your Excellency.

488
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,720
Mercy, Your Excellency.

489
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,840
Your Excellency. Mercy, Your Excellency.

490
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
I am guilty.

491
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,480
Mercy, Your Excellency.

492
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,630
I will never ever do it again.

493
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,230
I am guilty.

494
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,670
Your Excellency, mercy. Your Excellency, mercy.

495
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,880
Mercy, Your Excellency.

496
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,920
Kill.

497
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,080
Your Excellency, mercy.

498
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,230
Your Excellency, mercy. I am guilty.

499
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,000
What do you think of my puppets?

500
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,560
You are scared?

501
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,560
It is said

502
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,560
you let go of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian.

503
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,560
I failed to do my mission.

504
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,600
This is my last time to warn you.

505
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,920
If that happens again

506
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,280
Wen Ning would be the one who comes here.

507
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,000
It will not happen again.

508
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,080
Uncle Wen brought me up and I am grateful.

509
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,200
As long as Uncle Wen has an order

510
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,280
I dare not disobey.

511
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,440
As long as you understand.

512
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,320
I am testing Yin Iron.

513
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
You acupuncture me.

514
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Copy that.

515
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,800
Take it.

516
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,080
Take them all.

517
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,560
This

518
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
and this,

519
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,560
and this.

520
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,640
Senior sister. Senior sister.

521
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,520
That's enough.

522
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,520
It'll take more than two years for us to eat them all.

523
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,360
Li, enough.

524
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,920
The children from Jiang clan of Yunmeng

525
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,400
are not so delicate

526
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,560
that cannot face the storm outside.

527
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
Uncle Jiang,

528
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,440
do you have something to give us?

529
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,840
What should be given has been given.

530
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,880
Hold your sword beside you and keep your creed in heart.

531
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,120
To attempt the impossible, right?

532
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,840
That doesn't mean

533
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
making mischief

534
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,880
when you are aware of the result.

535
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,160
Mark my words.

536
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,360
Do nothing before you achieve something.

537
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,360
So, it is not early.

538
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,440
Set off, please.

539
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Childe Jin.

540
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,960
Bro Wei.

541
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,680
Bro Jiang.

542
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,360
Jiang Cheng

543
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,920
where are people from Lan clan of Gusu?

544
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,760
What do you think?

545
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,840
Is there something wrong?

546
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,360
It might be good that Lan Wangji doesn't come.

547
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,600
Don't you forget he has Yin Iron.

548
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,360
Chances are Wen Chao fails to find him

549
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,600
and he hides himself away.

550
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,400
But I feel something wrong here.

551
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,600
Take care of yourself first, OK?

552
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,160
Second Childe Wen is here.

553
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,520
Second Childe Wen is here.

554
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,920
Everyone forms a queue.

555
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,120
Look at your appearances.

556
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,400
You all look like sleepy mangy dogs.

557
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,600
Why the hell don't you bring him over?

558
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,880
Lan Zhan.

559
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,000
Lan Zhan.

560
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,000
Wei Wuxian, don't make troubles.

561
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,080
As long as he is fine,

562
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:51,775
you'll get a chance to ask him about everything.

563
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,400
That thing

564
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,840
might be sent into the Cold Pond Cave.

565
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,840
I know.

566
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Lan Zhan.

567
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,720
Lan Zhan.

568
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,280
Silence. No talking.

569
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Since you guys are here in Qishan,

570
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,920
you shall follow Qishan's rules.

571
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,220
First and foremost,

572
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,600
during indoctrination

573
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,120
no one is allowed to carry weapons personally,

574
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,440
in case of disturbing His Excellency.

575
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,880
Now let us start.

576
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,840
Hand in your swords one by one.
