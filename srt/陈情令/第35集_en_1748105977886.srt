1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was surprised to see that it was a black cat.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was surprised to see that it is black cat.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He said he would break your legs.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He just said it.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
What do you want?

24
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
I'll tell you...

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,600
Lord Han!

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry, Lord Han.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Please listen to me, Lord Han.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
It's not over.

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Wait for me.

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
You little rabbit.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
I always thought...

32
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,000
that Jiang Cheng would always stand by my side.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And Lord Han would always stand by my side.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I never thought...

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
that everything would be completely lost until now.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Lord Han

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Lan Zhan, I'm fine.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What's going on?

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is just an ordinary evil curse.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When he comes to me,

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll just break it off.

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
By then, you have to help me.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't handle it myself.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, right.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you find him?

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where is he?

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are we going to find him?

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, we're not.

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm just going to tell you.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Did we find that person?

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He came from Jinling.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You met Jiang Wanyi.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
As long as two people are alive,

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
how could they meet?

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll carry you.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was just pulled by Zi Dian.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just had a leg numbness.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't even break it.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Besides, it's too hard to carry a man.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is it?

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is it nice?

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You used to carry me.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How could I carry you?

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You remember it wrong.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How could I carry you?

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You never remember this.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Lan Zhan, are you okay?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't force yourself.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Or I'll carry you.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not good at all.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Anyway, I'm not good.

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not good.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you doing?

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Lan Zhan, you recognized me in the big mountain?

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How did you know?

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to know.

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You told me.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I told you?

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because of Jinling?

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Or because of you?

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not right.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Think about it.

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just tell me.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Looks like we're old friends.

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know.

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know.

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know anything.

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I really don't know anything.

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Han Guajun.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's really not me.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Han Guajun.

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I just passed by.

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I really don't know anything.

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't know?

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then I'll tell you.

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Will you tell me?

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You suddenly know.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong with you?

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Han Guajun.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you have wine?

104
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The route has been passed down

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
by people and people.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But it's not true.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So it's just a rumor.

108
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And the rumor will make ordinary people

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
leave the route.

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So his work is just a prescription.

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And this is just the first prescription.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know what to do.

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know what to do.

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know what to do.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know what to do.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is just the first prescription.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This young master.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think you are a little familiar.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then there will be the second one.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The second prescription

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is the monster on the road.

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If ordinary people

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
don't hesitate to break into the road

124
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or get into the forest,

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the monster on the road

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
will also run away.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The third prescription

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is the mysterious town near the castle.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If the previous two prescription

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
are ordinary people,

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
the third prescription

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
is the repair of the door.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But it's just a normal repair.

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If it's a repair of a spirit or a spirit,

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
a repair of the special power of the mysterious town

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
or a level of the Lord Han Guang,

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
then this prescription

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
can only be broken.

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The third prescription

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
is just a ten-person treasure

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
on the road.

142
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not found by anyone.

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then who is the person

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
who set up this treasure?

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I already know.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is the location of the Qinghe Nye family.

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
In addition to the Nye family,

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
no one can easily set up

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
these three officials on the Qinghe family.

150
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Moreover,

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
you will be seen near the castle

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and leave evidence.

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The Qinghe Nye family

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
set up a ten-person treasure

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
on the road.

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What exactly is it?

157
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
How did the body in the wall

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
come here?

159
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Did he eat anyone?

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Chief Nie,

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
if you don't speak clearly today,

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
be careful that you are thrown out.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The Xuanmen family

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
came to ask for punishment together.

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I will tell you the truth.

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I will tell you the truth.

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I will tell you the truth.

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I will tell you the truth.

169
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I will tell you the truth.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I will tell you the truth.

171
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I will tell you the truth.

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Chief Nie,

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you have to ask for punishment together.

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You can't say it out loud

175
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
unless you are willing to listen.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No one will believe you anymore.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's not all.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's my ancestral grave.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ancestral grave?

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Your ancestral grave can't be put in the body

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and it can't be used as a knife.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Commandery Han,

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
before I say it,

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,240
You see, in our two families,

185
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,000
your brother and my brother are in the same position.

186
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,960
No matter what I say,

187
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
you...

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and the one next to you,

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
you must not tell anyone.

190
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
If anything happens,

191
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
please help me to make a witness

192
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
and tell me a few words.

193
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
Lord Han Guang,

194
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,760
you always talk and talk.

195
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,400
As long as you swear,

196
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,960
I'll believe you.

197
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,360
As you wish.

198
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,560
Then let me ask you,

199
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,360
is he not eating human treasures?

200
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,000
Did he eat any of them?

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,160
He did.

202
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,840
No, no, no.

203
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,520
But it's not what you think.

204
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,720
These are not the main mistakes

205
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,920
in our family.

206
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,120
It's decades ago.

207
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,320
The rumors about eating human treasures

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,720
were spread from that time.

209
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,560
I was just responsible for the speed of the sky

210
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,920
and the spread of rumors.

211
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm willing to ask.

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,320
Lord Han Guang,

213
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
you know that

214
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,520
our Nie family is different from other Xianmen's families.

215
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,920
The four ancient righteous channels

216
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,120
are all made of sword and sword.

217
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
But...

218
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Of course, except for...

219
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,920
Who is that?

220
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,960
He is made of talisman.

221
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,200
Our Nie family's ancestors

222
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,880
are a disciple.

223
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,720
So our family is made of talisman.

224
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Our ancestors' sword

225
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
is strong in strength and strength.

226
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
Almost every family member

227
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,440
is a devil.

228
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,880
They hate death.

229
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,920
And they are in a bad mood.

230
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,120
They have a great relationship with them.

231
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,640
Before the family members were born,

232
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,960
their sword was used to control the master.

233
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
But after the master died,

234
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,480
they were not controlled.

235
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,640
They became a weapon.

236
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,840
Oh?

237
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,920
This is close to the evil channels.

238
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
No, no.

239
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,800
The evil channels are the evil channels.

240
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,120
It's because they want to kill people.

241
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,880
But our family's sword

242
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,720
doesn't need people to kill them.

243
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,680
Instead,

244
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,800
they need the devil to kill them.

245
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,680
They have been killing too many things in their whole life.

246
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,400
If they don't give them these things,

247
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,040
they will be in a bad mood.

248
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
They can't live in peace.

249
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,320
And every sword leader

250
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
can only recognize one master.

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,040
He can't do anything for others.

252
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,440
We, the descendants,

253
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,560
can't tolerate the sword.

254
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,640
First, it's not good for the ancestors.

255
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,160
Second, even if it's tolerated,

256
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,400
it can't be solved.

257
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,960
But it's really the Great Master.

258
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,600
No way.

259
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
The sword that follows the evil channels,

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,920
the evil channels,

261
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,520
the evil channels that search for the Taoist Taoism

262
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
is actually the Great Master.

263
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,800
The cultivation of our ancestors

264
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
is getting worse and worse.

265
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,280
This problem is getting worse and worse.

266
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,360
Until our sixth generation,

267
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,560
he came up with a way.

268
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,760
It's to build a human treasure?

269
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,240
It's almost the same.

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,320
But what I thought at first

271
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,720
wasn't this way.

272
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,320
He just gave his father and grandfather's sword

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,760
and made two coffin dishes.

274
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
He built a rock.

275
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,280
It's strange that

276
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,440
there's no precious item in the rock.

277
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,680
But it's under the pressure of hundreds of demons.

278
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,440
Hanguang Jun, listen to me.

279
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,620
We didn't collect these for the sake of the

280
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,120
descendants.

281
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Since the Taoists want to fight against these evil channels,

282
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,520
they'll give them the evil channels

283
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,600
to fight them.

284
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,720
So we'll bury the evil channels and the Taoist Taoism

285
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,960
as a burial item.

286
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,840
We'll use the spirit of the Taoist Taoism

287
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,160
to bring back the peace of the descendants.

288
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,240
Then why did he eat people?

289
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,320
He didn't eat people.

290
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,120
Even if he ate people,

291
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,480
it's not what you think.

292
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,320
The one we started to cultivate

293
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,880
is actually a wood.

294
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,400
It's a common grave.

295
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,280
But after that,

296
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,280
the Tumus was dug by Teh during the찬.

297
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,480
Is this really Taishui could put douил on the freedom?

298
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
Probably not.

299
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,240
I heard Teh on the road

300
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,200
was a wooden ladder.

301
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,640
So they just closed the restaurant.

302
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,080
There were background articles coming.

303
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,120
They dug outgeist tribeslerin

304
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,520
in winter style, watermelon style,

305
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,840
but the ding mobilized the cave

306
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
with the beautiful manner of weapons.

307
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,260
Come on, come on.

308
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,120
This can bring you much pleasure.

309
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Let's go!

310
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,700
Goodness.

311
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,080
Dodging the Holy Do من正門?!

312
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,800
It can't be?

313
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
How can you.

314
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,520
Kuanhluan Legion

315
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,300
All kinds species

316
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,400
This, in other words

317
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,220
Theúde has been successfully passed

318
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,240
Disaster has been again

319
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,260
that number of theheros

320
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,560
was made of煮 hurry

321
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,200
Well said

322
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,980
They've never yet come out

323
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,120
or entered the course

324
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,160
Me and Yufeedu

325
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,540
have arrived.

326
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,140
There are not offers.

327
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,660
Someone is gossiping

328
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,900
the CityCr vowel was

329
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,220
bad people gave abed

330
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,100
the IlulIn.

331
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Our family

332
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,580
wanted to make a big spot

333
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
so nobody has brought

334
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,640
the mountain sig

335
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,920
Welcome

336
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,500
litres and

337
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,400
two

338
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,720
gu

339
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,480
Lee

340
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,900
off

341
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:26,240
Miss

342
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,500
is

343
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,220
I will go there regularly to check it out.

344
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,780
I saw this today.

345
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,420
I just picked up this stone and a dog chased me.

346
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,100
I... I...

347
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,860
This chicken soup is similar to our ancestral powder.

348
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,860
The ordinary cultivators know this is our land.

349
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,380
They will not come to celebrate this era.

350
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,220
Who knows?

351
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,020
Who knows that it's so unlucky?

352
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,900
I met a golden spirit with many rules.

353
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,380
Isn't that right?

354
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,580
Lord Han Guang, and this young master.

355
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,460
I have told you everything I should and shouldn't have.

356
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,540
Don't tell anyone.

357
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,980
I will follow your order.

358
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,060
Thank you, Lord Han Guang.

359
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,700
Then...

360
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,260
Can I say goodbye first?

361
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,620
Wait.

362
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,860
Brother Nie.

363
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,060
What's so funny? Let me see.

364
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,140
Be careful.

365
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,620
This is my favorite fan.

366
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,460
Look. The gold and the bridge are made of different materials.

367
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,980
How is it?

368
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,660
Is it a good quality?

369
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,860
I think it's like that.

370
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,460
What do you mean by that?

371
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,460
This fan is made of different materials.

372
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,340
It's a good quality.

373
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,900
Young master, you are so good-looking.

374
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,540
I will leave now.

375
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,140
Lan Zhan.

376
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,460
What are you doing?

377
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,420
I am all out.

378
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,180
It's nothing. I am walking here.

379
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,660
Are you carrying handentry for Haoran?

380
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
I...

381
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,180
It's time for the last round.

382
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,900
Okay.

383
00:22:50,660 --> 00:23:16,800
Come on

384
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,280
light

385
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,800
if

386
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,780
a

387
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,540
and

388
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,720
an

389
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,160
He's getting better and better

390
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,660
Dry There

391
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,080
ava

392
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,180
La la La la ya

393
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,220
Yo yo yo yo 27

394
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,620
Damn Slender

395
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,300
Da publishing

396
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,880
Squad

397
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:54,620
Its shape does not exist under the

398
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,060
Sand Valley

399
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,500
I have never seen her this green

400
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I've never seen him like this.

401
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
He's like something's been stimulated.

402
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
It's something on you.

403
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
The evil curse?

404
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
The evil curse was set by Jin Ling in the Stone Castle.

405
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Jin Ling's reaction to the evil curse is so strong.

406
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Does it mean...

407
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,500
The Stone Castle you're watching is where Jin Ling takes us.

408
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Put that side up.

409
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Be careful.

410
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Lord Han, and this...

411
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Lord Nie, where's the air bridge?

412
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Yes, yes, yes.

413
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Excuse me.

414
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Maybe I'll have to trouble you to get back in the air.

415
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Okay, okay.

416
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Wait!

417
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Lord Nie, don't worry.

418
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
We just want to see what's in the Stone Castle.

419
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I'll give it back to you later.

420
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
I...

421
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Help me.

422
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
You...

423
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
You...

424
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Go seal the front line.

425
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
No.

426
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
We don't know what's the reason for us to be here.

427
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
It's too dangerous to be here.

428
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
You...

429
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
You...

430
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
What are you looking for?

431
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
But we're wrong.

432
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
We're not here to kill the people.

433
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,500
The murderer, Jin Ling...

434
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
He's the master.

435
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
No, no, no.

436
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
You must have been mistaken.

437
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
No one uses the sword in our world.

438
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
We use knives.

439
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Lord Han, I really didn't lie to you.

440
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
You...

441
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Lord Nie, you didn't lie to us.

442
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
And you were wrong about us.

443
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
The evil spirit can only be found on the sword.

444
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
It means it's a spirit weapon.

445
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,500
But who can guarantee that it must be Jian Ling?

446
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Lord Nie, there's something.

447
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Can I trouble you?

448
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
There's something else.

449
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
It's not a trouble.

450
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
It's just that I need to trouble you

451
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
to get all the weapons and knives out of here.

452
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
What?

453
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Lord Han, are you a little...

454
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I...

455
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Lord Nie, please.

456
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Open the door.

457
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Yes.

458
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
The last one.

459
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Is this the last one?

460
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
It's so strange.

461
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
All the knives here

462
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
have no sharp edges like the Tiger's.

463
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Nor the sharp edges of the Tiger's.

464
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Nor the sharp edges of the Tiger's.

465
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Could it be...

466
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Lord Nie,

467
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
have all the knives in your family

468
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
been here?

469
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
They're all here.

470
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
What?

471
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
You haven't dug enough for your family?

472
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm afraid not.

473
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
You...

474
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
What do you mean?

475
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I'm afraid of the elephant.

476
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
You mean

477
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
the knife of Lord Chifeng is not here?

478
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Brother!

479
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Brother!

480
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Brother!

481
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Brother!

482
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
I'm going to kill you!

483
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Go away!

484
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Brother!

485
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Don't go over there.

486
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Brother, don't go over there.

487
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Brother!

488
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Brother!

489
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Brother!

490
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Brother!

491
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Brother!

492
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Brother!

493
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Brother!

494
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Brother!

495
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Brother!

496
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Brother!

497
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Brother!

498
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Don't kill me.

499
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Brother!

500
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Brother!

501
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
So Lord Chifeng is in the Golden Flower Pond

502
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
and is in the Golden Mines.

503
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
But he's still running away.

504
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
And no one has seen his body.

505
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
That's right.

506
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Isn't that the same as me?

507
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Lan Zhan,

508
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
if the knife of Lord Chifeng is the one

509
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
who is the one who killed Lord Chifeng

510
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
and he brought us here

511
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
to tell us who his master is,

512
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
where will he take us next?

513
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
I believe you.

514
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
It seems that this knife of the forest

515
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
really fits us.

516
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Do you think

517
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
he will take us to Lord Chifeng?

518
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Yes.

519
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
It seems that whoever left this knife

520
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
in the Mo's Manor

521
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
is all to make us find Lord Chifeng.

522
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
So,

523
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
it's not an accident to go to the Fire Tribe.

524
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
I think

525
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
it's not an accident to go to the Fire Tribe.

526
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
And looking at the knife of the forest

527
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
in such a hurry,

528
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm afraid Lord Chifeng

529
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
will die.

530
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
But

531
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
even if Lord Chifeng is really killed by someone,

532
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
what's the connection

533
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
between the fire and my fire?

534
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Will someone

535
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
harm me?

536
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm sure of it.

537
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Chief Nie,

538
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
you were so rude just now.

539
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
I'm really sorry.

540
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Lord Mo, you're being serious.

541
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
If it really is...

542
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
If it really is

543
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
the evil of my brother,

544
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
we will naturally

545
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
not do anything wrong.

546
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
But after I fix the knife of the forest,

547
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I will naturally go to look for

548
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Lord Han Guang and Lord Mo.

549
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
If...

550
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
If I really can find

551
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
my brother's corpse,

552
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
then I...

553
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Then I will also...

554
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Chief Nie,

555
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
if you can confirm

556
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
the corpse of Lord Han Guang,

557
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Lord Han Guang will definitely

558
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
fly it to you right away.

559
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Let's go.

560
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
How is the evil group?

561
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
It's not bad.

562
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
But there's still a little bit left.

563
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
It's okay.

564
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Yes, but it's not the evil group.

565
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
How much is a little bit?

566
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
A little bit...

567
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
is a little bit.

568
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
How can I tell you?

569
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,500
How about I give you a peek?

570
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Lan Zhan, let me ask you a question.

571
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Do you think that

572
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
the one who left the knife of the forest

573
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
to Lord Mo and killed Lord Chi Feng

574
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
is the same person?

575
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Two pieces.

576
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
As you can see,

577
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
if this person really killed Lord Chi Feng,

578
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
but the corpse is not even

579
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
willing to let everyone find it,

580
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
it's even more impossible to

581
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
leave the knife of the forest

582
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
to hurt the Lan family.

583
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Because it's too easy to be investigated like this,

584
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
it's too easy to be discovered.

585
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
One is a heartless person,

586
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
the other is afraid that

587
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
everyone will not find it.

588
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
So they are definitely

589
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
not the same person.

590
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
The person who killed Lord Chi Feng

591
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
seems to know a lot of

592
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
the secret of the evil group.

593
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
The person who left the knife of the forest

594
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
knows my identity.

595
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
I'm afraid that the path is not easy.

596
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
There are so many secrets.

597
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Step by step.

598
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
How do you recognize me?

599
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Think about it yourself.

600
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Lan Zhan.

601
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm leaving. I'll be back.

602
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Come on.

603
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Come on.

604
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Come on.

605
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Come on.

606
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Come on.

607
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Come on.

608
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
It's been a long time.

609
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Lan Zhan, it's been a long time.

610
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Sir,

611
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
the city is a haunted house

612
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
for many years.

613
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Don't go around.

614
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
It's very dangerous.

615
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I heard that

616
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
there are dozens of people in Yueryang City.

617
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
They were killed overnight.

618
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
The soul of the person

619
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
is trapped in the house.

620
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
They can only be in trouble overnight.

621
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
It's all because of a decade ago.

622
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Now,

623
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
there is no such thing.

624
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Because of the previous

625
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
ancestors who passed through this place,

626
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
they were already in our shop.

627
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
It seems that they are still sitting in your place.

628
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Fairy?

629
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Lan Zhan.

630
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
I didn't expect

631
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
that we would still come back

632
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
to this place.

633
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Lan Zhan.

634
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
You did it on purpose?

635
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
That night,

636
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
you didn't know

637
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
that the whole day was red.

638
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Blood red.

639
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Blood red.

640
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
The whole night

641
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
was lined up

642
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
with people.

643
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
It was horrible.

644
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
What happened next?

645
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
A few buildings were built

646
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
and a person was caught.

647
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Who was caught?

648
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
I don't know.

649
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I'm happy.

650
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
You don't know?

651
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Xing Chen and Song Lan

652
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
were the ones who caught Xue Yang here.

653
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
The one who was the gentle one.

654
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Now,

655
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
I'm afraid that

656
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
it's the guest of the day.

657
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Drink.

658
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
That little Liu Mang didn't die.

659
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
He became a real guest.

660
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
No matter what,

661
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
16 years ago,

662
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Xue Yang suddenly appeared on the Golden Forest Platform.

663
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
All the family members

664
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
were in charge of Xue Yang.

665
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Only Jing Guang Shan was against it.

666
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
He said he killed 50 people in Chang Shui.

667
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Did anyone see it?

668
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Can't I save one person?

669
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
What happened next?

670
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Later,

671
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
the only one who was in charge of Chang Shui

672
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
was Chang Ping.

673
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
He was killed.

674
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
What?

675
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Chang Ping announced

676
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
that Chang Shui was killed

677
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
and Xue Yang was killed.

678
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
He was killed by a tiger.

679
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Until Jing Guang Shan died,

680
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Jing Guang Yao, the head of the family,

681
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
was killed by a tiger.

682
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Xue Yang was killed.

683
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Xue Yang was probably killed.

684
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
I heard that he was killed by a enemy.

685
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
It's none of his business.

686
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
No one has seen him after that.

687
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Even if he's not dead,

688
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
he can't find us.

689
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Come on, drink.

690
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
I heard

691
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
he has something to do with the Yiling Lao Clan.

692
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Right?

693
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Drink.

694
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Again?

695
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
I didn't expect

696
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
that in 16 years,

697
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
everyone in the Yiling Lao Clan

698
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
is still so cruel.

699
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I'm involved in everything.

700
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
No.

701
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Xue Yang was killed by a tiger.

702
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
How did I get the message?

703
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Didn't they come out?

704
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Xiao Xing Chen disappeared.

705
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
He was sent away.

706
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
No one has seen them.

707
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
For so many years,

708
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
no news has been reported.

709
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Lan Zhan.

710
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
16 years ago,

711
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Chang Ping suddenly lost his eyes

712
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
overnight.

713
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
He died in the forest.

714
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
The weapon he had in his hand

715
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
was

716
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
the Soul Flower.

717
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
What?

718
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
How is that possible?

719
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
So

720
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
they all thought

721
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Xiao Xing Chen was the one

722
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
who killed him.

723
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I've only seen

724
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Su Lan once

725
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
after the engagement.

726
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
I thought I would regret it

727
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
but I didn't expect that

728
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I would never see him again.

729
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
To be honest,

730
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I'm quite envious

731
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
of Xiao Xing Chen

732
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
and Su Lan.

733
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
We were

734
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
in the dark

735
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
but they were

736
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
not involved in anything

737
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
in the family.

738
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
They were

739
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
so down

740
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
because of

741
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
their own problems.

742
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
It's true.

743
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
It's true.

744
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
That's right.

745
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
It's true.

746
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm a man of my word.

747
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
I'm a man of my word.

748
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I'm a man of my word.

749
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
I'm a man of my word.

750
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I'm a man of my word.

751
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm a man of my word.

752
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm a man of my word.

753
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
I'm a man of my word.

754
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
I'm a man of my word.

755
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm a man of my word.

756
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I'm a man of my word.

757
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I'm a man of my word.

758
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm a man of my word.

759
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
