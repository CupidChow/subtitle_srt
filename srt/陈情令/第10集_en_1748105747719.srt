00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fifth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The fifth one is the first one.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The fifth one is the first one.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fifth one is the first one.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The body acted out.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,380
there are thrinations of Ganon and Hongsi...

35
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,120
Even those dying here were created by the Lightruction machinery.

36
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,140
And who are the murderers?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:22,300
Viele du

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,240
He's an extraordinary player.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,760
Xue Young.

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
I won't let you escape today.

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,840
You're really果 keeping.

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,200
fished me so long

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
but you still found me?

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,560
Who are you?

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,840
Why do you kill innocent?

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,640
It's been more than ten days.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm so tired.

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,760
I must enjoy today

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Xue Yang, since you came down the mountain, you have been hiding the gate for countless times.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
I have been chasing you for half a month, and you have been shot to death.

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Now you have killed dozens of people in the long run.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Today, you must be punished for your crime.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Qian You, I will be punished for my crime.

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,760
But if I am punished, I will see if you can catch me.

55
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
What is this?

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
What?

57
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
It's fun.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
What?

59
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
First, close the door.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Since this guy has a secret code, I don't know how much he is taller than this guy.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Let's close the door first.

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
What?

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Nan Zhan, do you still know how boring this is?

64
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Nan Zhan, do you still know how boring this is?

65
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
How is it, kid? Is it fun?

66
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
What is your name? So awesome.

67
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,760
My name is Wu Yi, and my name is Tong Pao.

68
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
But I am here to do something for you.

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
It's too little to mention.

70
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I have to give him another name.

71
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Why don't we call him Tong Si?

72
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Qian Kunxiu, be careful.

73
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Xing Chen.

74
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Zi Chen.

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Xue Yang, do you admit your crime?

76
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Yes.

77
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes.

78
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Yes.

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
So you are all family members.

80
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
No wonder you are so mad.

81
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I am Xing Chen.

82
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
This is my friend, Song Lan.

83
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Ming Yue is a little bit mad.

84
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Xue Ling is the one who sent Zi Chen.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
I am Ya Ming.

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I am sorry for your misjudgment.

87
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I dare not.

88
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I was wandering around today.

89
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
I saw the information of Xing Chen.

90
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
So I came here.

91
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
You are all so kind.

92
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
You are so famous.

93
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I didn't expect to see you.

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Kid, why are you laughing?

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Nothing.

96
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
I just think you are just a little bit of a coward.

97
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
You...

98
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Xue Yang is young but she is very active.

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
She is very cunning.

100
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,760
She has been involved in the case of the Immortal family.

101
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
She is the one who did it.

102
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
She is so kind now.

103
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,760
She will escape when she has a chance.

104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
We should not let her get into trouble.

105
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Interesting.

106
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
I want to see how she will escape.

107
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Give it to me.

108
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
What?

109
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
The cause.

110
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I don't understand what you are talking about.

111
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
I am just a victim.

112
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I am not a criminal.

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
I am not a thief.

114
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I am just a gold digger.

115
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Lan Zhan, what are you doing with her?

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Just get on her hand.

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Give it to me.

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
I will do it myself.

119
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
You are a famous man.

120
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
You are a big man.

121
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
You are afraid of being caught.

122
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Sorry.

123
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,760
The Immortal family is very generous.

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
I am the second one.

125
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
No one dares to fight for the first place.

126
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
You are interesting.

127
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Lan Zhan, why don't you try it?

128
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
See if you can find the cause.

129
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
No need.

130
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Since I entered this hall,

131
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I am not in a hurry.

132
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
There must be something strange.

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,760
She is so obedient and kind.

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
She must be very good at hiding the Yin Iron.

135
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
You see,

136
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,760
where does she hide the Yin Iron?

137
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
This is the most dangerous place.

138
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
The safest place.

139
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Let's go.

140
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Xue Yang, let me ask you.

141
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Are you the one who sent the Wens?

142
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
You are so good at saving me, Xue Yang.

143
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I am just a little rogue in Kuizhou.

144
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I am just a little group.

145
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,760
I can judge the Wens from the first-class people.

146
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
You are not good at the first-class people.

147
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
You are not good at the first-class people.

148
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
You are a little family.

149
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
You are not good at keeping your love.

150
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
You are just a little group.

151
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Yes, I killed a few little immortals.

152
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
But I have told you before.

153
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
This has nothing to do with Wens.

154
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
It is just my personal grudge.

155
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Personal grudge?

156
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
What kind of personal grudge

157
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
makes you so cruel and cruel?

158
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
If I have ever to see her...

159
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,760
I would like to know your idleness.

160
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Never...

161
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Let me ask you some questions.

162
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
We should ask the question about Wens.

163
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Brother Wei, Brother Lan and Brother Jiang.

164
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Brother Nie.

165
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I just came here in the inn

166
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
after I arrived at the Moiao Street.

167
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,760
What's going on?

168
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Why are you so cruel?

169
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Brother Nie.

170
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Brother Nie.

171
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm worried about your safety.

172
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm here to welcome you.

173
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I'm here to see you.

174
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Please go to Qinghe.

175
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Brother, you're here.

176
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
But I don't know anything.

177
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
It's nothing serious.

178
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
But please go with me.

179
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I'll wait for you.

180
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Brother Nie.

181
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Brother.

182
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Xuyang is a big man.

183
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I don't know if you can leave her to us.

184
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I'll take her to the inn

185
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
and deal with her.

186
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,760
By the way, this is the place of the Clan Leader Nie.

187
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Clan Leader Nie is always so wise.

188
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
He loves to give and share.

189
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm sure he'll be able to handle it.

190
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Of course.

191
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Xuyang is a cunning man.

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
He's a smart man.

193
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
He's a smart man.

194
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
You'd better leave now.

195
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Aren't you going with us?

196
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,760
We'll say goodbye now.

197
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Since we're here,

198
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,760
we should go to Qinghe together.

199
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
We should discuss how to deal with Xuyang

200
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,760
and deal with Wen's plan.

201
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I don't know anything about Yin Iron.

202
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Brother Song is a small person.

203
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
I'm a family member of Brother Song.

204
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Yin Ze is a member of Qingque.

205
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
He's a good friend.

206
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
He doesn't want to be a family member.

207
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Xuyang is now in the house.

208
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
I believe you'll discuss it with us.

209
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
As for the dispute between the people,

210
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
we really don't want to discuss it.

211
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
That's right.

212
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
If you need me to

213
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
get the world closer to you,

214
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,760
I'll do it.

215
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,760
Almost done.

216
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
A very friendly boy...

217
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,760
how to deal with your criminal partner.

218
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Mine and Lan Zhan were too deal with too many kills

219
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
so they decided to get out.

220
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Right Lan Zhan?

221
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Even that,

222
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
without you joining me.

223
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
You...

224
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm Bai Xuege.

225
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
I'm Baoshan Sanren.

226
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Baoshan Sanren?

227
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Wei Guang.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
What's wrong?

229
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm not a good person.

230
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm not a good person.

231
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
I'm a bad person.

232
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I'm not a good person.

233
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm not a good person.

234
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Wei.

235
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
I'm Baoshan Sanren.

236
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
But I'm the most bad person.

237
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
So I know that

238
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I'm a bad person.

239
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
But I've never seen it.

240
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I didn't expect you to be a child of the junior sister.

241
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Yes.

242
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
Although we are old,

243
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,760
but you're still my uncle.

244
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I don't know when

246
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I can see my uncle and his family.

247
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Master is good in the wild.

248
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
He's not a bad person.

249
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Besides,

250
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
the disciple of the mountain is not in Huishan.

251
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
He's in charge of the door.

252
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
But if Master sees Mr. Wei,

253
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
he'll be happy.

254
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Let's go.

257
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Xing Chen.

258
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Xing Chen.

259
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Don't forget me.

260
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Let's go and see.

261
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
What a good young master.

262
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
He's so good.

263
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
He's so good at playing the flute.

264
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
All right.

265
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Let's go back to the Qing River.

266
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
By the way,

267
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
you must watch the sunset.

268
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Don't worry.

269
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Let's go.

270
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Let's go.

271
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Let's go.

272
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Xing Chen.

273
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Xing Chen.

274
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Xing Chen.

275
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
These are the new brothers' men.

276
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Since the Qishan's Wen clan sent people to pass the message,

277
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
the chief sent people to strengthen their defense.

278
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Pass the message?

279
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Second Young Master doesn't know.

280
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Recently, the chief of the Wen clan sent people to pass the message.

281
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
He said that he would choose at least one of the disciples of the inner gate

282
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
to pass the message to Qishan.

283
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
He must have something to do.

284
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Otherwise,

285
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
what will happen?

286
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Wen clan will send people to attack.

287
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
One, two, three, four.

288
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
All the new brothers' families

289
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
said that we were among them.

290
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
They have a school in Lan City.

291
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
They are in the school.

292
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
The school in Lan City

293
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
is where the ancestors' children are going.

294
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
The school is the one who comes to catch people.

295
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Where is the school?

296
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
It's the school of catching people.

297
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
The inner gate is the one who sends the message.

298
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
No.

299
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
The inner gate of the Nian clan's disciples

300
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
is only me.

301
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
What should I do?

302
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
No.

303
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I have to ask the eldest brother.

304
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
What?

305
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Chief.

306
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
It's not the Chifeng Cui.

307
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
He is still alive.

308
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Huaisang is the eldest brother.

309
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Huaisang.

310
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
What did you just ask me?

311
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Nothing.

312
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Young master Jiang.

313
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Young master Wei.

314
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I heard from Qishan that

315
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
the two young masters of Yunmeng

316
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
are very young.

317
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Today, they are very famous.

318
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Wangji.

319
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
How is your elder brother?

320
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
He is good.

321
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Thank you for your concern.

322
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
He is fine.

323
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
It's him.

324
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Yes.

325
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Take him in.

326
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Go.

327
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Please.

328
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
You are so generous.

329
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
You are so generous.

330
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
You are so generous.

331
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
You are so generous.

332
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
If you can't find Yin Tian,

333
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
then the Ninth Emperor will punish you.

334
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Wait.

335
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
What?

336
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Are you begging for mercy for the stone?

337
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Chief Nie.

338
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Now the situation is not clear.

339
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
We have to find out.

340
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
We won't be late.

341
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
The consequences of the money are clear.

342
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Brother.

343
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Chief Nie.

344
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,760
If I really work with Qishan,

345
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
I'm afraid that

346
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,760
the whole Nieshi family

347
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
will have a fight with Yueyang.

348
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
The Wen family is not human.

349
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
They are the gods.

350
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
I, Nie Mingjue, am the top emperor.

351
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
I have no other choice but to avenge my son.

352
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Don't be angry, Chief.

353
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Although I am not good enough,

354
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Yin Tian is the only one

355
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
who affects the safety of the Xianmen family.

356
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Moreover,

357
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Xueyang is the chief's dream.

358
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
It's a matter of time to kill him.

359
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Why don't we ask Yin Tian

360
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
as soon as possible?

361
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm afraid that the Wen Ruohan

362
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,760
doesn't know Xueyang is in our hands.

363
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
We'd better not make any progress.

364
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
If we take a step ahead

365
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
and ask Xueyang for Yin Tian,

366
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,760
then it's no use to be so suspicious.

367
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
This is not easy.

368
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
The land is not old.

369
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
It's really hard to get along with people.

370
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
No way.

371
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
My brother is very kind.

372
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
It seems that Jin Guangshan is not a talent.

373
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Meng Yao,

374
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
put him in the prison

375
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,760
and send the people to guard the Yan family.

376
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Yes.

377
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Guards.

378
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Let's go.

379
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,760
One, two, three, four.

380
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
One, two, three, four.

381
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Guards.

382
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Guards.

383
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Guards.

384
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Guards.

385
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Go.

386
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Chief Nie is strong.

387
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
In the next few days,

388
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
we'll send the people to guard the land.

389
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Guards,

390
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
why don't you go with me

391
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
to escort the rebels?

392
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I know.

393
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Brother,

394
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
can you go with me now?

395
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
This is the Chief's order.

396
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
All right, Meng Yao.

397
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,760
You just have to arrange for the guests to come in.

398
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,760
You can just wipe out the rebels.

399
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
You can't even

400
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
get involved in the war.

401
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Meng Yao,

402
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
I know that

403
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
the soldiers in the Yan family

404
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
are going to be in danger.

405
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Of course,

406
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I have to listen to you.

407
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
But

408
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
the situation in the prison

409
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
is quite serious.

410
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
I hope you don't think too much.

411
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Otherwise,

412
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I can't bear to

413
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
blame you for being so stubborn.

414
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Then you go to find

415
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
the Chifeng Lord.

416
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Jin Xue.

417
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
You're so stubborn.

418
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Why don't you think about

419
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
who you are?

420
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
It seems that

421
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
four silver bars

422
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
are all missing.

423
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
To be serious,

424
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
there are only three pieces.

425
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
No one has seen

426
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
the piece on Xue Yang's body.

427
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Does anyone know

428
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
the origin of Xue Yang's son?

429
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
But...

430
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
he is Xue.

431
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
You mean,

432
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Xue Chonghai?

433
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Xue Chonghai?

434
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
I'll tell you later.

435
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
You know it again.

436
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm sorry.

441
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
I'm sorry.

443
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm sorry.

444
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I'm sorry.

445
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
No matter what happens to Xue Yang,

446
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
the Wen clan

447
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
will take two silver bars first.

448
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Wen Chao has already taken the lead.

449
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
He's already exposed.

450
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
He's already warm-hearted.

451
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
He won't let it go.

452
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
I think there's a problem

453
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
with the Wen clan.

454
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Actually,

455
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
as long as we can

456
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
make the silver bars

457
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
into magic bars,

458
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
and turn them into the silver bars of the Wen clan,

459
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
isn't it easy?

460
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
You're right.

461
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
You...

462
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
A thousand years ago,

463
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
the ancient masters of the fairy mountain

464
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
couldn't make a silver bar.

465
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
The family of the Lan family

466
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
and the Tianzi family

467
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
were all in vain.

468
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
As a first-class man,

469
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
I suggest you

470
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
not to move your head

471
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
to make these magic bars.

472
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Then,

473
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
how should we make the silver bars

474
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
now?

475
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
By the way,

476
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
does the Wen clan

477
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
know that you're in the Bujing City?

478
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
The Wen clan has been following us

479
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
along the way

480
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
like a dog's skin.

481
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
You said we caught Xue Yang.

482
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Do they know?

483
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Then,

484
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
will the Bujing City be in danger?

485
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Wang Ji,

486
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Xichen told me

487
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
that he found the silver bars

488
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
in the forbidden book.

489
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
And the golden bars

490
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
were taken by you

491
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
to the ancient city with the silver bars.

492
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
It's not a good idea

493
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
to make a big exchange.

494
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Yes.

495
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Wait.

496
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Brother Zongling,

497
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
you're so stubborn.

498
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
You're so stubborn.

499
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Childe Wei,

500
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
why are you here?

501
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I just went to drink.

502
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
I didn't find the wrong way.

503
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Why didn't you go to the Bujing City?

504
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I was ordered to watch Xue Yang.

505
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

506
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Please.

507
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
The gold bars in Qinghe

508
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
are more brilliant than the ones in Gusu.

509
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
They're all different.

510
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
The earth is full of holes.

511
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
The sky is the back,

512
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
the earth is the west.

513
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Lan Zhan.

514
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Go to bed.

515
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Wei Ying.

516
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
I'm going.

517
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Wei Wuxian.

518
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Wei Wuxian.

519
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Wei Wuxian.

520
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Where did you go again?

521
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Where did you go tonight?

522
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
I don't know.

523
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Maybe I went to drink.

524
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
I'll get going.

525
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Come with me.

526
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Something happened outside.

527
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
What's wrong?

528
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
What's wrong?

529
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
The Wen Clan is coming.

530
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Go.

531
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,760
What's wrong with Mr. Wen?

532
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Chief Nie.

533
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,760
The matter of the alliance with the Chang City

534
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
is very serious.

535
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
I'll handle the matter.

536
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
How can I let some

537
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
unknowingly

538
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
late-today

539
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
of the late-today

540
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
of the late-today of the late-today?

541
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Chief Nie.

542
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm here to tell you something.

543
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I'll give you a chance

544
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,760
to give out the Yin Iron and the Fan Ren Xue Yang.

545
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
I'll think you're a Xuan Ya Le Ma

546
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
who's no longer pursuing the Yue Clan.

547
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Nian Mo.

548
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
It's a difficult life.

549
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Nian Ming Jue.

550
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Don't drink too much.

551
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Just drink.

552
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Good knife.

553
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Good knife.

554
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Good job.

555
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
It seems that you Qinghe Nieshisi

556
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
are going to stay with Gusulan

557
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
as a group.

558
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
I don't know what's behind the heaven and hell.

559
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Since that's the case,

560
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
I'll ask for the late-today

561
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
to clean the door.

562
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Huai Zi.

563
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
I'll go and check on Xue Yang.

564
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Meng Yao.

565
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Meng...

566
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Silly.

567
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
I'll go and help the late-today

568
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
to the gate of Ji Hao Camp.

569
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Chief.

570
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Go to the dungeon to find Xue Yang.

571
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I'll go and find Chi Feng Village.

572
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Go to the dungeon to find Chi Feng Village.

573
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Go to the dungeon to find Chi Feng Village.

574
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
No!

575
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
No!

576
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Xue Yang is running away!

577
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
What?

578
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Meng Yao!

579
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Meng Yao!

580
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
It's not me.

581
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
It's not me.

582
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
It's really not me.

583
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
It's really not me.

584
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Xue Yang killed her.

585
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Be careful!

586
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Be careful!

587
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Meng Yao.

588
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
Stop!

589
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Chief Nie.

590
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Qing He is at the foot of Qi Mountain.

591
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
And you are at my foot now.

592
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Chief Nie.

593
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Brother.

594
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Wen Chao.

595
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
This is the place where Qing He and Nie are.

596
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
I suggest you not to fight too much.

597
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Wei Wuxian.

598
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Wei Wuxian.

599
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
You really love to interfere in matters of the late.

600
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,760
You love to interfere in the Lan clan's affairs, right?

601
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Okay.

602
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I'll tell you now.

603
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,760
My brother Wen Xu has taken someone to the Gu Su.

604
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Even if he can return to the Gu Su,

605
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
what do you think he can see?

606
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,760
That is the place where the Cloud Deity is.

607
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,760
That is the place where the Cloud Deity is.

608
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Lan Cunzhu.

609
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Those three silver iron were used by our Wen family.

610
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
You little rascal.

611
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Nie Mingjue.

612
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
You helped the few people who hid the silver iron today.

613
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
You hit my Wen family.

614
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
It seems that my Wen family has been too long.

615
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Your family members

616
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,760
don't even care about us.

617
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I let you go today.

618
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
But if there is another time,

619
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
you will be in the next Cloud Deity.

620
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,760
As for you, Wei Wuxian.

621
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
My father has ordered

622
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,760
all the family members to go to Qishan.

623
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I'll play with you then.

624
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Let's go.

625
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Brother.

626
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Brother.

627
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Wuxian.

628
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Bring Meng Yao to see me.

629
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Let's go.

630
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Brother.

631
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Cunzhu.

632
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Please wait.

633
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Please explain to me.

634
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
What do you want to explain?

635
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
I can't break it.

636
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
What do you have to break?

637
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Cunzhu.

638
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Cunzhu, you consider me as your father.

639
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,760
But you always despise me.

640
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,760
You always treat me like a fool.

641
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
So you killed him.

642
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
No.

643
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
It's not because of this.

644
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
If you don't put me in the eyes,

645
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
I'll bear it if I'm in a hurry.

646
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,760
It's really because he always takes me for a dog.

647
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
It's okay.

648
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Just now,

649
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,760
I saw him let go of Xueyang

650
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
by myself.

651
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
I went up to find his reason.

652
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
This time, it's all because of this.

653
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
My mother said that my mother is...

654
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
You're lying.

655
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm telling the truth.

656
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
You're so stubborn.

657
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
You're just a little bit of a public figure.

658
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
You care so much about this humiliation.

659
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
I'm sorry,

660
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
but I have to tell you this.

661
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
I'm sorry.

662
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
You're so stubborn.

663
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
You're just a little bit of a public figure.

664
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
I'm sorry.

665
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm sorry.

666
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm sorry.

667
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm sorry.

668
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm sorry.

669
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm sorry.

671
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
I'm sorry.

672
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
You saved me today.

674
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
I don't understand you.

675
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
You can go.

676
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
No matter where you go,

677
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,760
I will never come back.

678
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Master.

679
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Master.

680
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Master.

681
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
I want

682
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
to thank you for your kindness.

683
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

684
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

685
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

686
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

687
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

688
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

689
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

690
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

691
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

692
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

693
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

694
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

695
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

696
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

697
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

698
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

699
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

700
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
I want to thank you for your kindness.

701
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
Master.
