00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,580
He's right under the sky.

67
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,020
Is he having a hard time?

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,020
Chief Nie, Master Meng is injured.

69
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020
I don't know what crime he committed.

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
I'm afraid that...

71
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Don't mention it again.

72
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,020
Master Jiang, Master Wei.

73
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,020

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
Lan Zhan is on his way back.

78
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm afraid that he might be in danger.

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Wei Wuxian,

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,020
Wen Shi sent someone to listen to the news.

81
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,020
Wen Xu went to Cloud God's place.

82
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,020
I don't know who went to Lotus Cove.

83
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
Right.

84
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
Let's go back to Lotus Cove.

85
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
That's right.

86
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,020
Now that Wen Shi is in the Cove,

87
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,020
you two should go back to Cloud Dream as soon as possible.

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
As for Xichen...

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,020
I really hope that he'll be safe and sound.

90
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,020
I don't know what happened to him.

91
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,020
He's looking for me.

92
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Wait for me.

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,020

Good morning, Master Jiang.

Yes, uncle.

105
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,020
How is business?

00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Good.

107
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Uncle,

108
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,020
what happened to Yunmeng?

109
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Nothing much.

110
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,020
I just had some strange faces.

111
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
I heard that it's the little fairy's house

112
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
and asked the head of the village head.

113
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,020
I'm not very clear about the rest.

114
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Come, let's go.

115
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
Come, let's have a new face.

116
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Please wear it.

117
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Thank you, uncle.

118
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Remember to come and have tea.

119
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:50,020
Young master, young master is back.

120
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,020
The fairy is back.

124
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,020
My lady!

125
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020

126
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,020
My lady!

127
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
What is it?

128
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
Why are you so anxious?

129
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Young master is back.

130
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
It's A-Xie.

131
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
A-Cheng and the others are back.

132
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,220
Hello temple leader?

133
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,120
Ah, it's...

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
material?

136
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,760
It'll hurt a lot just like this kind of sp 76

137
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,720
Do you want to know a lastings den or not?

No..

139
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,860
Why would you do that?

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,020
Please, give me a second

You're such a brother.

150
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,420
I don't know what I did in my life.

151
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
You've worked hard.

152
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
Don't be angry.

153
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,420
In the next life,

154
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
we'll still be brothers, okay?

155
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Wait.

156
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Uncle Jiang, I'm the one who violated the rules.

157
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
I'm leaving.

158
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
And Jiang Chengchun is going to see me.

I'm sorry.

162
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Cheng, Ah Xian.

163
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
Is it safe to go out this time?

164
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Is it dangerous?

165
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Dad, Uncle Jiang, it's our fault.

166
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
I let you miss me.

167
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
Dad, we're not going to play this time.

168
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
We're going to play with Lan Wangji.

169
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
Ah Xian, Cheng.

170
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,420
Ah Xian, Ah Xian.

171
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,420
Do you miss me, Ah Xian?

172
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Ah Xian, don't mind her.

173
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
Ah Xian, how are you doing?

174
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Ah Xian must miss me.

175
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Ah Xian is thin.

176
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Do you want to be a face?

177
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Okay, okay.

178
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Let's have dinner first.

179

Okay.

Come, sit.

181
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Where's mom?

182
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
Your mom is a little tired.

183
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Let's use it first.

184
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Who said I'm tired?

185
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,420
Mom.

186
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Mom.

187
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
Come and sit and eat.

188
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
The kids are hungry.

189
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
I'll let them eat first.

190
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
Sit down.

191
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
It's also called hunger now.

192
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
When we arrive at Qishan in a few days,

193
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
I don't know if they'll eat.

194
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
I'll have a few more meals.

195
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm used to it.

196
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
No matter what happens,

197
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,420
we still have to eat today.

198
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Mom.

199
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
We really have to go to Tingxun?

200
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Ask your dad.

201
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Is that so?

202
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
I'm sure you're in the Qinghe City.

203
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
I'm not sure.

204
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm not sure.

205
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
I think you're in the Qinghe City.

206
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
I'm not sure.

207
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
I'm not sure.

208
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
I'm not sure.

209
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,420
I'm sure you've heard it before.

210
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
The Qishan Wenshi sent a special envoy

211
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
to Yunmeng.

212
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Each family will have to send

213
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
their own family to Qishan

214
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
in seven days.

215
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
They'll send people to call them.

216
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Cheng, A-Xian.

217
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
I'm going to tell you.

218
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
You guys should get ready to go.

219
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Call them?

220
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
That's what Wenshi said.

221
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
It's so shameless.

222
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
I'll eat with you.

223
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,420
Thank you, Senior Sister.

224
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,420
How can you still eat?

225
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Why are you so anxious?

226
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Why are you still so anxious?

227
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,420
Why are you still so anxious?

228
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
The legend says

229
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
if you dare to defy their orders

230
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
and refuse to hand over

231
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
the heir to my family

232
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,420
you'll be punished

233
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,420
for being a criminal.

234
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
What a big excuse.

235
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
What does the heir mean?

236
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Cheng and A-Li

237
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,420
at least have one in their family.

238
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,420
What are you going to do?

239
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Call them?

240
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
How can you call them?

241
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
You're going to be punished

242
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
for being a criminal?

243
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,420
You're going to be punished

244
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
for being a criminal?

245
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,420
Don't be angry. I'll go.

246
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,420
Of course you'll go.

247
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
Or I'll have to ask your sister to go.

248
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
Look at her now.

249
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,420
She even drank the lotus seed.

250
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420
A-Li, stop.

251
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Who are you going to give it to?

252
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
You're the master.

253
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
You're not the family's servant.

254
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
What's wrong?

255
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
Did I say something wrong?

256
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Family servant?

257
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
You don't want to hear this word?

258
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
Jiang Feng Mian, I'm asking you.

259
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Are you going to let her go this time?

260
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
She can go if she wants to.

261
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
I'll go.

262
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
That's great.

263
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
If she wants to, she can go.

264
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
If she wants to, she can.

265
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Why do we have to go?

266
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
You raised your son like this.

267
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
You're a good person.

268
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Master Jiang, you're a good person.

269
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
I think you're tired.

270
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
You should go back to rest.

271
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Mother.

272
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
What are you doing?

273
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
You're like your father.

274
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
I'm not going to say anything.

275
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
You're a fool.

276
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Tell me.

277
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
You can't compare to the one sitting next to you.

278
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
You can't compare to Xiuwei.

279
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,420
You can't compare to Ye Lie.

280
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
You have to go to death.

281
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
There's no way.

282
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Your mother can't compare to other people's mother.

283
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
She can't compare to you.

284
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,420
But your mother is not fair to you.

285
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
How many times have I told you?

286
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,420
Don't be a fool.

287
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
You even want to talk to her.

288
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
How can I have a son like you?

289
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
Okay, let's eat.

290
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Okay.

291
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
The Soul Land.

292
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Soul Land.

293
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Lan Zhan,

294
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
you're so arrogant.

295
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,420
You even got my hand.

296
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Well,

297
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,420
kneel down.

298
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Walk the stone and give me the silver.

299
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,420
I'll spare your life.

300
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
You know what?

301
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
I hate you the most.

302
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
You're so high-ranking.

303
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Who do you think you are?

304
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,420
You're just a building under our flag.

305
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Wen Zhu Liu, shoot!

306
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
You're so high-ranking.

307
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
You're so high-ranking.

308
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
You're just a building under our flag.

309
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
You're just a building under our flag.

310
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Are you still chasing?

311
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,420
No, I'm just letting him go.

312
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
Brother Jia is here.

313
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,420
I'll let him go and see if he can get rid of the waste.

314
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
When can a building be built?

315
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Shoot!

316
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
Shoot!

317
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Shoot!

318
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Open fire!

319
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Put your hands up!

320
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Put your hands up!

321
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Put your hands up!

322
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,420
All of you, all of you!

323
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Master,

324
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Master Wen Xu has surrounded the mountain.

325
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Yang Yang Yao, fire the mountain!

326
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Uncle.

327
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
The mountain is so deep.

328
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
It's really hard to swallow.

329
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Uncle,

330
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Wen Xu's Chiyan Manor has a fire poison.

331
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
Don't mess with me.

332
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
Where's Wang Ji?

333
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Can you contact him?

334
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
You must contact Wang Ji.

335
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Let him go.

336
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Don't come back.

337
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
He might be out there.

338
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
Maybe he can survive.

339
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Maybe he can survive.

340
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Uncle.

341
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Master.

342
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Master.

343
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
It's bad.

344
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Outside.

345
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Brother Wen Xu, you're so weak.

346
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Did you forget what I taught you?

347
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Lord Ze Wujun,

348
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
the disciples of Wen Xu have surrounded the mountain.

349
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
They've broken the barrier.

350
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
They've put the fire on the place.

351
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
The fire has been spread to the disciples' residence.

352
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Uncle,

353
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
the situation is very bad.

354
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
The fire is very bad.

355
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
The water is very cold.

356
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Please take the ancient skill of the book

357
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
and leave the place.

358
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Master.

359
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
I'm leaving.

360
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
What do you do?

361
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
What about the others?

362
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
We've retreated to the cave.

363
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
There's no silence.

364
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
They can't get in.

365
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
Uncle.

366
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
The situation is very bad.

367
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
The Lord has been in danger.

368
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
No matter what,

369
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
we must protect the foundation of the Lan family.

370
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
Xichen.

371
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Don't say that.

372
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Leave.

373
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
I'll stay.

374
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Uncle.

375
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
If you still recognize me as uncle,

376
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
then leave.

377
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Uncle.

378
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
I'm the master.

379
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
I've lost my life and my life.

380
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
I'm the master.

381
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
You're the master.

382
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
I'm the master.

383
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,420
I'll leave.

384
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
I'm not the master.

385
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,420
I won't die.

386
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I won't leave.

387
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
I won't leave.

388
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
I won't leave.

389
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
I won't leave.

390
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,800
Kozulaoshimashed minimum

391
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,120

392
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,300
Allacher Nasmer

393
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,520
The external compeÏires

394
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,560
hasty entrance

395
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,320
into handles

396
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Dad.

397
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Oh, it's you two?

398
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
What's the matter?

399
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
It's so late.

400
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
What's the matter?

401
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Uncle Jiang,

402
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,420
things are so complicated now.

403
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
I'm afraid it's none of our business.

404
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
This matter is long.

405
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm afraid it's going to be

406
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
a long story from the beginning.

407
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,420
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
We came back from Qinghe.

409
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
I've been sending messages to Lan Zhan.

410
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
But I can't get his reply.

411
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
And now the Wen clan is getting more and more

412
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
unbearable and showing their true colors.

413
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
They're getting more and more ruthless.

414
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
They're secretly trying to change the name.

415
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
I'm worried that

416
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
there's no place for them to be.

417
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
Actually,

418
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
I've known what you said.

419
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
You knew it long ago?

420
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
When you were in school?

421
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,420
The advantages and disadvantages of the Lan clan.

422
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
That's right.

423
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
We just didn't know

424
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,420
that the Wen clan would be so bright and bright.

425
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,420
When you were in Qinghe,

426
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,420
you came to Fengxing again.

427
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
It's said that

428
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
the Lan clan is already

429
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,420
the new clan of Wen clan because of the Yin Iron.

430
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Wen clan is already in the ancient tribe.

431
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
I'm afraid it's not just a message.

432
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
It's a simple message.

433
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
What should we do?

434
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Will Wen clan be doing the same thing to us?

435
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Although Wen clan is in a big situation now,

436
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
the Lan clan said

437
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,420
that the Yin Iron is very complicated.

438
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
It's not good.

439
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
It's because of the power of the Yin Iron.

440
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,420
So,

441
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
before the Wen Ruohan was in power,

442
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
he shouldn't have sent people

443
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
to attack and corner all the sects.

444
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
In case they would have attacked.

445
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
It's just that the Lan clan

446
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,420
and the Yin Iron are too much.

447
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
I'm afraid that

448
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
they can't take care of it anymore.

449
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I don't think so.

450
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,420
A-Chen,

451
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
it's not a delay.

452
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
You two will leave together in three days.

453
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
But...

454
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
I know

455
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
it's going to be hard for you two.

456
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Uncle Jiang, I understand.

457
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
Now that the situation is better than before,

458
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
we went to Qishan.

459
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,420
We will take care of ourselves.

460
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,420
As for Wen Chao,

461
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
he doesn't like to attack us.

462
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
He doesn't dare to kill anyone.

463
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
I know that I can't do anything.

464
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
I have my own way.

465
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
I can do anything.

466
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,420
How many people are outside?

467
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
All disciples have been disbanded.

468
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
They can't get in.

469
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
There should be more people outside.

470
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Sir, let's go in.

471
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
I'll wait here.

472
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
Sir!

473
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
What's going on?

474
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
What's going on?

475
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Kill them!

476
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Kill them!

477
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Uncle, let's go.

478
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Kill them!

479
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Kill them!

480
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Follow them!

481
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
Kill them!

482
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
How do we get in?

483
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,420
I... I'm a disciple of the outside world.

484
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,420
I don't know.

485
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
I'm afraid you'll forget.

486
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Listen up!

487
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Hand over the silver iron.

488
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420
Otherwise, I'll kill all of you

489
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,420
who are not worthy of your life.

490
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,420
I'll kill them!

491
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
Let's go in again.

492
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Let's go in.

493
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
Let's go in.

494
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm not hungry.

495
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,420
All of them are not worthy of your life.

496
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,420
The silver iron is the only one.

497
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Only the disciples can get in.

498
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
I'll kill you, coward!

499
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
How can you be so stupid?

500
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Finally, I have a reason to say it.

501
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
I'm not hungry.

502
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Where is Anxi Chen?

503
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
He...

504
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
He's gone.

505
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
He's gone!

506
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Wang Ji!

507
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Uncle, it's here.

508
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Lan Yi Qian told me

509
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,420
that I'm not worthy of your life.

510
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,420
You're right.

511
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,420
I'll kill you.

512
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,420
Wang Ji, you're finally out.

513
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,420
Let him go.

514
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
I'll kill him.

515
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Where is the silver iron?

516
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,420
I'll go to the mountain to kill him.

517
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
Okay.

518
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,420
Let him go.

519
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
By the way,

520
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
aren't you amazing?

521
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Come on.

522
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,420
Let me hit his leg.

523
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Come on.

524
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
Come on.

525
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,420
Come on, brother.

526
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
Come on.

527
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,420
Go on.

528
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
Come on.

529
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Come on.

530
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,420
Come on.

531
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,420
What the hell?

532
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Come on.

533
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
It's too hard.

534
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Come on.

535
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Come on.

536
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Come on.

537
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Come on, brothers!

538
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
Come on, brothers!

539
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
It's not that far.

540
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Can you stand it?

541
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
Guess.

542
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Come on, brothers!

543
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Come on, brothers!

544
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Come on, brothers!

545
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Come on, brothers!

546
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Good!

547
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Good!

548
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,140
Good! Good!

549
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,700
Good! Good!

550
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,220
Senior Brother is really good.

551
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,820
Even if he goes to Mount Ji,

552
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,340
he won't be afraid of our Wen clan.

553
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,500
He'll teach them a lesson.

554
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,380
Let them know that

555
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,180
we Jiang clan are not good at bullying.

556
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
The sun...

557
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,180
I'm afraid it's not as good as today.

558
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,140
It's just that

559
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,620
it's not known whether it's good or bad.

568
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,780
ä¸è½Yijun, please help us!

569
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,040
Jin clan is also...

570
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,300
Jin clan is in danger!

571
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,500
Jin clan is in danger!

572
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,220
Jin clan is in danger!

573
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,060
Jin clan is in danger!

574
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,500
Jin clan is in danger as well!

575
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,420
Help, Xie Du.

576
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,660
Xie Du, help.

577
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,260
He's wrong.

578
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,260
Help, Xie Du.

579
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,420
He's wrong again.

580
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
He's wrong.

581
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,780
Xie Du, help.

582
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,820
Help, Xie Du.

583
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,940
Kill him.

584
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,980
Xie Du, help.

585
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,900
Xie Du, help.

586
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,020
He's wrong again.

587
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,460
Do you think my puppet is good?

588
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,940
Help.

589
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,540
Are you scared?

590
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,340
I heard that

591
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,460
you've let Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji go.

592
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,580
Wen Qin is not doing well.

593
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,220
This is the last time I remind you.

594
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,740
If you do it again,

595
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,220
Wen Ning will be here.

596
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,820
No, not again.

597
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,940
Uncle Wen didn't raise Yu Zhen for Wen Qin.

598
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,180
As long as you ask me for my life,

599
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,140
Wen Qin will do it.

600
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,260
Good.

601
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,140
If I lose my body,

602
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,180
you'll be my teacher.

603
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,580
Yes.

604
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,060
Take it.

605
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,100
Take it.

606
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,620
Take it.

607
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,300
Take this.

608
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,300
Take this.

609
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,060
And this.

610
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,220
Senior sister,

611
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
that's enough.

612
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
We can't finish it in two years.

613
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,820
Ah Li, that's enough.

614
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,220
My son, Yun Meng,

615
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,100
is not as fragile as he is.

616
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,420
He's not as fragile as he is.

617
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,420
He's not as fragile as he is.

618
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,220
Uncle Jiang,

619
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,100
do you have anything else to give us?

620
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,260
I've already given you

621
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,580
what I want.

622
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,620
I'll give you everything I want.

623
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,820
You can't be so naive, right?

624
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,220
You mean

625
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
you're not going to the warehouse

626
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,780
but to do something?

627
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,900
Hey.

628
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,220
Remember,

629
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,340
if you don't do it,

630
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,180
you'll be in trouble.

631
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,340
Alright, it's late.

632
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,340
Get up.

633
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,940
live

634
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,600
What a opponents expansion...

635
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,020
What generally matters are who ace the first

636
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,660
He toasts

637
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Brother Wei, Brother Jiang.

638
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Why is there no one in Gusulan's world?

639
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:49,660
Brother Wei, Brother Jiang.

640
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Did something happen?

641
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Maybe it's good that Lord Lan didn't come.

642
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
Don't forget that Yin Die is still with him.

643
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Maybe Wen Chao didn't find him.

644
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
He hid it himself.

645
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,660
But I feel something is not right.

646
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
You'd better take care of yourself.

647
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Second Prince Wen is here!

648
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Second Prince Wen is here!

649
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Everyone, get ready!

650
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,660
You all are so lucky.

651
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,660
You're just like the stray dogs that don't sleep.

652
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Why don't you take him out?

653
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Lan Zhan.

654
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,660
Lan Zhan.

655
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Wei Wuxian, you're too late.

656
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
It's good that you're fine.

657
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
The rest of the people are afraid that you won't be able to ask.

658
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,660
Maybe that thing has been sent to Handan Cave.

659
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,660
I know.

660
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Lan Zhan.

661
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Lan Zhan.

662
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
Don't talk.

663
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
Since you're here,

664
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,660
you must follow the rules of Qishan.

665
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
The first thing is,

666
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
no one should wear a weapon

667
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,660
when you're listening to the message.

668
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,660
So as not to disturb the people.

669
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Let's start now.

670
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Everyone should be on their own.

671
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
I'm sorry.

672
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
I'm sorry.

673
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
I'm sorry.

674
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,660
I'm sorry.

675
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
I'm sorry.

676
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,660
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
I'm sorry.

678
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,660
I'm sorry.

679
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,660
I'm sorry.

680
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,660
I'm sorry.

681
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,660
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,660
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,660
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,660
I'm sorry.

686
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,660
I'm sorry.

688
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,660
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,660
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,660
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,660
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,660
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,660
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I'm sorry.

699
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,660
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,660
I'm sorry.

703
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,660
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,660
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,660
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,660
I'm sorry.

708
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,660
I'm sorry.

709
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,660
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
I'm sorry.

712
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,660
I'm sorry.
