1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first time I saw a black cat, I thought it was a black cat.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought it was a black cat.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought it was a black cat.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought it was a black cat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought it was a black cat.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And made a stitchingους out of it.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It was made of wood.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But it looked like I was thinking of something.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,060
I made a stitchinguses out of it.

10
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,000
Thanks to the inner design, I end up having the kind of inclusion from theoffice.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,160
Qui

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
What's wrong?

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,360
You've journalistised Xia electronic drink.

14
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,020
It's too late to deal with what�� the whole city thought of you.

15
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,220
Whochuckles so much at you, Mr. Yao?

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,900
Master Jiang must have thought I was such a selfish re который!

17
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,920
Go forward, arrow your blade and back down...

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,020
...to honor penguin He.

19
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,140
But he can't help me and is bonded with me.

20
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,280
Now Tim Finally A day has passed.

21
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,880
We are the only two of them.

22
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,040
The chief is very badly hurt by us.

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,280
We tried to escape and we couldn't find him.

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Please take care of the chief.

25
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,960
Please help us.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,160
Father, Wen Ruohan has ordered

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,320
to chase out all the children of Qishan

28
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,600
and the family of Zhu Lian.

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,280
Kill them all.

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
I have a lot of things to do.

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,840
I have many things to do.

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,040
I have no intention to go to all the families.

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,680
But I didn't expect

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,680
to be killed by them.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,160
You should rest well.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
Since we are in Lianhua,

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,440
I will try my best

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,960
to protect the family.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,960
Thank you, chief.

40
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,640
No need.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,720
Go prepare a room

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,040
and heal the wound for the chief.

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,080
Yes.

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,880
Chief.

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,440
Uncle Xiang.

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,680
Father.

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
Wen Shi Ji sent out the people.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm sure they will release the soldiers.

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm afraid for the chief,

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Lian Huawu is not safe.

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm also thinking about it.

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Wen Ruohan killed the ancestors.

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,440
Now it seems that only the Lanling Jin clan

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,600
is capable of fighting against the enemy.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,200
But Jin clan...

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,000
Uncle Jiang.

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,680
Jin Zixuan is a good man.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,200
Even if Jin clan doesn't dare to fight against Wen Shi,

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,640
as long as Jin Zixuan stands by our side,

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,200
I believe Jin clan

61
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,640
won't look at all the family members

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
and be like Wen Shi.

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,200
That's right.

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,840
Father.

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,120
This time, I will save A Xie

66
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
and take the soldiers with me

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
to the Lanling.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,640
Father.

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,800
I'll go with you.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,360
No.

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,520
A-Chang, A-Xie.

72
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,480
You two keep Lian Huawu.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,480
Yes, Uncle Jiang.

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,440
A-Chang.

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,800
A-Chang.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
A-Chang.

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
A-Chang.

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
A-Chang.

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
A-Chang.

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,840
A-Chang.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,840
A-Chang.

82
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,840
A-Chang.

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,840
A-Chang.

84
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,840
A-Chang.

85
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
A-Chang.

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
A-Chang.

87
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
A-Chang.

88
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Zi Fan.

89
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,640
I'm leaving for a few days.

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
While we're here,

91
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
you must follow the instructions

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
of the two brothers.

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
You must practice with them.

94
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Don't be too bold.

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Do you hear me?

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,040
Yes, Uncle Jiang.

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
Father, don't worry.

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,640
I'll protect Lian Huawu.

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,440
Uncle Jiang, Sister.

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Go back early.

101
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Have a safe journey.

102
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,440
Okay.

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Let's go.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
A-Li.

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
A-Li, come here.

106
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
I brought you something

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,440
this morning.

108
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
This box

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
is the gift from Granny Liu.

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
It's a gift from her.

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
This box is the gift from Qu Feng.

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
If you...

113
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,640
If you have any trouble with it,

114
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
remember to call her.

115
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
Call her to help.

116
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
I'll take it.

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Thank you, Mother.

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
You're welcome.

119
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
I'm here for your safety.

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,240
Go to Lanling.

121
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
It's dangerous.

122
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Take care of yourself.

123
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Go.

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Father.

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Let's go.

126
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Father.

127
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Father.

128
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Why didn't you let us go

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,240
to Lanling?

130
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,440
It's a matter of choice.

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm afraid Wen Shi won't let us go.

132
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Besides,

133
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,040
if we both go,

134
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
what will Lian Huawu do?

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Don't worry.

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
Uncle Jiang and Sister Shi

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
will be safe

138
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,640
after a few days.

139
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Wen Shi is so good at it.

140
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
Pingyang and Yao Shi,

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
they're so close to each other.

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
Jingye wants to kill them.

143
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
It's so terrible.

144
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,040
Wen Shi is so cruel.

145
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
He's so cruel.

146
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,040
We didn't know it the first day.

147
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,240
But he's so good at it.

148
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm afraid he'll be more

149
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,640
bloody in the future.

150
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Uncle Jiang.

151
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
We should take a good look at it.

152
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,440
If Wen Shi wants to find Lian Huawu,

153
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
how should we deal with him?

154
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
How?

155
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,840
How many Wen Shi evil people come here?

156
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I'll kill them all.

157
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
I'll kill them all.

158
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
What's going on?

159
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Father.

160
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
What's wrong?

161
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Is Xue Yang's whereabouts?

162
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Father.

163
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,840
I've sent someone to search everywhere.

164
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I've got no news.

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
Xue Yang's dead body was found

166
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
and he's dead.

167
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm afraid he's already killed someone.

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Father.

169
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
What's wrong?

170
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Call the police.

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
I've got an order.

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,640
Didn't you ask someone to send him to cure Lian Huawu?

173
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
Did you go to the doctor?

174
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,040
Do you want to get him back?

175
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Father.

176
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Father.

177
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Father.

178
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
No need.

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Wu Xishan's

180
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
roadblocks and burials.

181
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
You've sent someone to search.

182
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,840
What did you find?

183
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
I found that Xuan Wu.

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,440
He's dead.

185
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Dead?

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,840
The roadblocks were the ones

187
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,440
that Xue Chong killed.

188
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Is that it?

189
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Yes.

190
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,640
It must be Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji

191
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
who killed him.

192
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
But I found out

193
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
that Xuan Wu's heart was sealed.

194
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
It must be Wu who sealed it.

195
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,040
So we didn't find it.

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,240
Where's the key?

197
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
It's gone.

198
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240
It's gone.

199
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,440
Can this

200
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,240
roadblocks be a 100-year-old thing?

201
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
It must be a fake.

202
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Find it out.

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Yes.

204
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Father.

205
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Do you still consider other things

206
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,840
in Yunmeng?

207
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,840
If you want to kill him,

208
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,040
you can kill him.

209
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Yes.

210
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
It's not over.

211
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Come back.

212
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,040
It's so early today.

213
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I don't want to play.

214
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
It's boring.

215
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm afraid he might see the World Cup.

216
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,740
Uncle.

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,440
Right.

218
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
What types of mangy container

219
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,940
are you…

220
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,040
We're going after the folks here.

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:22,200
Pick them up with the 60

222
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Boss and Elder Brother.

223
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm afraid of the sky, the earth, and the birds.

224
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm afraid of the birds and the dogs.

225
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,640
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Hurry up and go to the sword.

227
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Hurry up.

228
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Zhang Cheng, Uncle Jiang and Sister Shi

229
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
have been away for ten days.

230
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Why haven't you come back yet?

231
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I received a letter from dad a few days ago.

232
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I've been working on it for a few days.

233
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm almost back.

234
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
I just don't know if I should talk to my mother

235
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
or send someone to pick me up.

236
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
I don't know if my mother's anger has gone away

237
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
after so long.

238
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,640
If I can go out, it's better.

239
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm afraid of the sky.

240
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Whose seal is this?

241
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
It's mine.

242
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
How dare you!

243
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Get me up!

244
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Brother Zhang, I'm done.

245
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Brother Zhang, Sixth Brother, Sixth Brother has been caught.

246
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Who? Why?

247
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I don't know. I don't know why.

248
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Why did you catch him?

249
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Don't worry. Tell me.

250
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
We went out to pick up the seal just now.

251
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
The seal fell over there.

252
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
We found it.

253
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
There are dozens of people there.

254
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
They are all from Wen clan.

255
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
The one who guarded it is a young woman.

256
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
She holds a seal in her hand and a sword on it.

257
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,640
We asked who the seal was.

258
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Sixth Brother said it was her.

259
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
The woman was angry.

260
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
She said something bold.

261
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
She caught Sixth Brother.

262
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Then?

263
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
We asked why she caught Sixth Brother.

264
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
She said she was not brave enough to hide her heart.

265
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
She even asked the guards to catch Sixth Brother.

266
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
There's no reason to catch her.

267
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Wen clan is going to go to heaven?

268
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Yes.

269
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
We are going to go to heaven.

270
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Don't argue.

271
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Wen clan is coming soon.

272
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Don't let them hear what we are going to catch.

273
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Let me ask you.

274
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Is that woman not a sword?

275
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
She looks very elegant.

276
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
She has a sword on her face.

277
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Yes, she is.

278
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
She is.

279
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
The Yellow Bell.

280
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
The Yellow Bell.

281
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Stop arguing.

282
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
It's so quiet.

283
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Mother, the Wen clan is coming.

284
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
They caught Sixth Brother.

285
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
You are shouting so loudly.

286
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I can hear it.

287
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
What's this?

288
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
It's catching her.

289
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
It's not killing her.

290
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Look at you.

291
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
You are so anxious and anxious.

292
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Do you still have any future?

293
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Be calm.

294
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
You are not too much.

295
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Have some firewood.

296
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Madam Yu,

297
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
there is nothing left to do.

298
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
The lotus root is quite good.

299
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
The wood is a bit dark.

300
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
It's not fresh.

301
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,480
I think Mrs. Yu,

302
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,040
you are too close to being the mother of the master.

303
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,960
I don't know how to explain it.

304
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,800
Here.

305
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,640
Here.

306
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,240
And here.

307
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,320
If you put some red sandals,

308
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
it should look good.

309
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,480
You caught me,

310
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
what exactly is the purpose of the Mengjiang City?

311
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,720
To make it.

312
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,480
You said I caught the one outside.

313
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,040
I will explain it later.

314
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
Where is the tea?

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,600
No tea.

316
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,360
I want to drink my own tea.

317
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't you people of the Jiang family

318
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,040
do anything?

319
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
The family of the Jiang family

320
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,760
has more important things to do.

321
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,800
You don't need to bring the trouble

322
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,040
to the people who send water for tea.

323
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,200
It's not a waste.

324
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,000
Mrs. Yu,

325
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,320
the Jiang family can't do this.

326
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,920
Even the servants

327
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,080
can make a mess on the hall.

328
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
If it's in our house,

329
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
it will be a crime.

330
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,800
Gold and silver are not ordinary families.

331
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,680
They have always been by my side,

332
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
and they never left me.

333
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
They never dare to

334
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,920
speak to anyone.

335
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,600
They can't.

336
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,080
Mrs. Yu,

337
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,760
what are you talking about?

338
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,000
In the world,

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
we have to be clear about the rules.

340
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,000
Otherwise, we will be in trouble.

341
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,560
The family is the family.

342
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,240
That's right.

343
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,240
The family should have the family.

344
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,840
But,

345
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,560
what do you want to do

346
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,600
to catch the Jiang family?

347
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Mrs. Yu,

348
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,880
I advise you to

349
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,800
make a clear line with this boy.

350
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
He is a good person.

351
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,440
I caught him.

352
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,880
A good person?

353
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,720
What good person can you be?

354
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,640
Come here.

355
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,120
Show Mrs. Yu.

356
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
This is the evidence.

357
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,280
What evidence?

358
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,640
This is a poisonous monster.

359
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,240
Do you think I'm blind?

360
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,880
Look carefully.

361
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,800
What color is this monster?

362
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
What shape is this monster?

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,880
So?

364
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,400
So?

365
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
Mrs. Yu,

366
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,080
the original and golden color.

367
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,640
What's it called?

368
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,720
It's like a sun.

369
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,240
There are so many kinds of seal.

370
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,600
Why does it have to be a poisonous monster?

371
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,360
Why does it have to be golden?

372
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,920
Why can't it be another shape?

373
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,880
Why can't it be another color?

374
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,040
Do you want to tell me

375
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,400
that this is a coincidence?

376
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,160
No way.

377
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,280
He did it on purpose.

378
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,440
He set this seal down.

379
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,800
He wanted to borrow money and set it up.

380
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,960
He wanted to set the sun down.

381
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,200
This is the biggest disadvantage

382
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
of the Qishan Manor.

383
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
Isn't it a lie?

384
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Although this seal is golden,

385
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,560
it's original.

386
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,520
But it's not the same

387
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,840
as the sun.

388
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,880
If you say so,

389
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,680
can't the orange be eaten?

390
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,080
The orange is golden, too.

391
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,360
And it's also original.

392
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,680
But you seem to like it.

393
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,560
So you came here

394
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,520
to set this seal down?

395
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,120
Of course not.

396
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,640
I came here to set up a person

397
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,000
for Mr. Wen of Qishan Manor.

398
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,560
This guy

399
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,840
was on the mountain of Muxi

400
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,040
when he fought with monsters and monsters.

401
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
He was so rude and cunning.

402
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,160
He was so cruel and cruel.

403
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,800
He was so mean.

404
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,120
Even his sword was damaged.

405
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,160
Luckily, Mr. Wen had a sword.

406
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,880
Even if he lost his sword,

407
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,840
he still won the monster.

408
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,640
Today, I'm here to

409
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,560
punish Mr. Wen's death.

410
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,120
I want to make a confession

411
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,840
to everyone in the world.

412
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Mother.

413
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,520
Step back.

414
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,320
This seal

415
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,440
must be your family name.

416
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,360
Now, Mr. Jiang is not here.

417
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,320
I think Mrs. Yu

418
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,920
should be a little bit worried.

419
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,520
If you have someone

420
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,480
to cover for him,

421
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,360
I can guess

422
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,800
if the rumors

423
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,200
are true.

424
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,920
What rumors?

425
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,320
What rumors?

426
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,880
Are they

427
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,240
the rumors of the chief of Jiang?

428
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,120
You...

429
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,360
Mother.

430
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
Step aside, Jiang Cheng.

431
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,840
Or you'll kneel down.

432
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,240
Jiang Cheng, don't worry.

433
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,920
U...

434
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
Wei Wuxian.

435
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,480
I've told you

436
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,960
many times

437
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,020
a lot of things

438
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,160
must be put in a big trouble for Jiang.

439
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,080
No, no, no, no, no.

440
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,740
No, no, no, no.

441
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,680
No, no, no, no, no.

442
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,860
No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,260
No, no, no, no, no.

444
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,800
Stop fighting.

445
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,140
Stop fighting, mom.

446
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,040
Jiang Cheng, get away from me.

447
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
What?

448
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
What do you mean?

449
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
What do you think Zidian is?

450
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
He's been so stubborn for so long.

451
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Don't even think about it next month.

452
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
He's got it.

453
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Isn't that when he's fine?

454
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,320
What do you want?

455
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Mrs. Yu, since it's a punishment,

456
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
she has to remember this for the rest of her life.

457
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm sorry.

459
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I'm sorry.

460
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm sorry.

461
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
I've always remembered this lesson.

464
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I've always regretted it.

465
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
I dare not to do it again.

466
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
If it's just a piece of paper,

467
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
after a few days,

468
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
she can still live and dance.

469
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,320
What punishment is that?

470
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
Besides, this young man

471
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,320
is easily sick and forgets his pain.

472
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,320
It's nothing.

473
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
How about you?

474
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
You cut his legs.

475
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Can't he live and dance since he died?

476
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Mr. Wen is generous.

477
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Of course, you can't do

478
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
such a cruel thing.

479
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
You just have to cut his right hand.

480
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Mr. Wen shouldn't have to remember it.

481
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
You cut his right hand?

482
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:56,320
That's right.

483
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Mother. Mother.

484
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Don't do things like what he said.

485
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Mrs. Yu, you have to think it through.

486
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
We'll surely find out

487
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
what happened to Qishan.

488
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
I'll take his right hand.

489
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
If you have any suggestions,

490
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
you can do it well.

491
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Or else,

492
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
when Mr. Wen comes,

493
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,320
it won't be easy.

494
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Close the gate.

495
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't let blood get into your eyes.

496
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
Mrs. Yu.

497
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Mother. Mother.

498
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Yanba.

499
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
If we can change the family's peace,

500
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
we'll keep fighting.

501
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Mother.

502
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,320
He can't let me see the left hand of the Marquis Xinhou.

503
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Yanba.

504
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
Yanba.

505
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Yanba.

506
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Yanba.

507
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Yanba.

508
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Yanba.

509
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Yanba.

510
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Yanba.

511
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Yanba.

512
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Yanba.

513
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Mrs. Yu.

514
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,320
I really appreciate you so much.

515
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,320
It seems that after we finish the investigation,

516
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
we'll be able to find an answer.

517
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
The investigation?

518
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Yes.

519
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
The investigation.

520
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
This is the second thing I come to know.

521
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
It's the new investigation order

522
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,320
I have been investigating every city.

523
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Now I announce that

524
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
this Lotus Wings is the new investigation

525
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
in our Wenshi.

526
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
What investigation?

527
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
This is my home!

528
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Mrs. Yu,

529
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,320
I advise you to teach your son well.

530
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
For hundreds of years,

531
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,320
everyone is a good man to Wenshi.

532
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
In front of Wenshi,

533
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
he said something like

534
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
your home and my home.

535
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I thought

536
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
this Lotus Wings is old

537
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
and there are some traitors.

538
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
I think you can't take it seriously.

539
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
But

540
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
since you listen to me,

541
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,320
my temper is a bit different.

542
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
So

543
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
I decided to put this book on the table.

544
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Get the Bradauen.

545
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,420
Want some?

546
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,680
Don't act like you care.

547
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,080
You're the one who's going to ruin my family.

548
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,800
You're such a fool.

549
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,720
How dare you call me a fool?

550
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm telling you,

551
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,720
the King of Chishan and King of Yin Chuan

552
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,960
will never protect you.

553
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
Shut up!

554
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
You bitch!

555
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,720
I've been in the fishing world for hundreds of years.

556
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,480
I've never heard of the King of Yin Chuan.

557
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,280
This is the subordinate family

558
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,880
from which British prison in Galilee.

559
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Is your family like that?

560
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,800
You're a fool.

561
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,560
I'm telling you,

562
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,600
you're a fool.

563
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,200
I'm a fool.

564
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,560
You're a fool.

565
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,080
My love.

566
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,520
My God.

567
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,480
My love!

568
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,680
My love!

569
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,160
I'll be right out.

570
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,880
You...

571
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,320
He...

572
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
He won't let you go!

573
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,520
You said it like you did now.

574
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,760
Do you know I'm the closest person to him?

575
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
I'm his closest person!

576
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,080
If you know you're like me,

577
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
he'll kill you!

578
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,880
What?

579
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,640
Is it a chopper or a chopper?

580
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,040
Or a firecracker?

581
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,320
Or a thousand-person war?

582
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
It's a fair place for me to live in.

583
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,120
I'll set up a spy.

584
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Don't come over!

585
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Don't come over!

586
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
What are you doing?

587
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Don't come over!

588
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Wei Chu Liang!

589
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Wei Chu Liang, help!

590
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
A single-handed?

591
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Purple-and-white pig.

592
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Purple-and-white pig.

593
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Wei Chu Liang, what are you waiting for?

594
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Kill him! Kill him!

595
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
You're called Zhao Zhu Liu, aren't you?

596
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
You're not a surname,

597
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
but you're a few-headed and you want to change your surname.

598
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
You're a weakling in the two regions.

599
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
You're so noble in the Wens.

600
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
You're so arrogant and ridiculous.

601
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
You're all so stupid.

602
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Wei Chu Liang, what are you talking about?

603
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Didn't you see how I was?

604
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
I told you to protect me.

605
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
How could you do that?

606
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Watch out!

607
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Watch out! I'll punish you!

608
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Sorry for the trouble.

609
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
You're so mean!

610
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Hurry up!

611
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Zhang Cheng, stop him!

612
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Don't let him get away!

613
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Don't let him get away!

614
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Don't let him get away!

615
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
An Niang!

616
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Hurry up!

617
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
A-Chen.

618
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
It's a good thing we didn't get hurt.

619
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,120
An Niang, what should we do now?

620
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
What do you mean?

621
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
You're so mean.

622
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
You can't just let him get away.

623
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
You're so mean.

624
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
You're so mean.

625
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
You're so mean.

626
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I can't even do anything.

627
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm sorry.

628
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I'm sorry.

629
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
What should we do now?

630
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
What should we do?

631
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Haven't you noticed?

632
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
They're here to protect us.

633
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
We can't let them get away.

634
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
We'll be here soon.

635
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Let's go.

636
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Senior Sister and Uncle Jiang...

637
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Shut up!

638
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
It's all your fault!

639
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
You're hurting him.

640
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
An Niang,

641
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
why did you give me Zi Dian?

642
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
You're the one who gave you the chance.

643
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Zi Dian has already recognized you.

644
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
An Niang,

645
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
aren't you going with us?

646
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
An Niang,

647
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
don't you know

648
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
that you're the one who gave me the chance?

649
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
I'm sorry.

650
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
I'm sorry.

651
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm sorry.

652
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm sorry.

653
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I'm sorry.

654
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
I'm sorry.

655
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
I'm sorry.

656
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm sorry.

657
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm sorry.

658
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm sorry.

660
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
I'll never leave.

661
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
An Niang!

662
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
An Niang!

663
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
An Niang!

664
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
An Niang!

665
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
He will naturally let you go

666
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
after he's safely arrived.

667
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
If anyone comes on the way,

668
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Zi Dian will protect you.

669
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
Hui Ying,

670
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
listen carefully.

671
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Protect Jiang Cheng,

672
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,600
I will protect her, do you hear me?

673
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,360
Madam Yu!

674
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,680
Don't talk nonsense! I only think you heard me!

675
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Mother!

676
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,480
Father...

677
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,600
I haven't come back yet.

678
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,360
Can't we just stay together for a while?

679
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,920
If you don't come back, then you can't come back.

680
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,880
I can't leave her.

681
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,560
Mother!

682
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,760
Father!

683
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Mother!

684
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
Mother!

685
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Mother!

686
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,280
Mother!

687
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,080
Mother!

688
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,160
Mother!

689
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Mother!

690
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Mother!

691
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Mother!

692
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Mother!

693
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Mother!

694
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
It's not broken!

695
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
It's not broken!

696
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
It's not broken!

697
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
It's broken!

698
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
It's broken!

699
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
It's not broken!

700
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
It's broken!

701
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Jiang Qiang!

702
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Listen to me.

703
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Calm down first.

704
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Yu Feiren is not sure

705
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
about that Huatan.

706
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
She didn't hold on to that

707
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Wen Zhu Liu just now, did she?

708
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
How can I calm down?

709
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
How can I calm down?

710
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Even if I kill Wen Zhu Liu,

711
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Wang Lingjiang will send a signal.

712
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
If Wen Chao

713
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
send a big army of people

714
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
to poison our family!

715
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Jiang Cheng!

716
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Look!

717
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
It's Uncle Jiang and Sister Shijie.

718
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Uncle Jiang!

719
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Father!

720
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Sister Shijie!

721
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Let us go!

722
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Let us go back to the house!

723
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Uncle Jiang!

724
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Father!

725
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Uncle Jiang!

726
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Father!

727
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Uncle Jiang!

728
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Father!

729
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Uncle Jiang!

730
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Father!

731
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Father!

732
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Father!

733
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Father!

734
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Uncle Jiang!

735
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Father, it seems that

736
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
it's what Ah Xin and Cheng did.

737
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Sister!

738
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Father!

739
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Hurry!

740
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Put the bed on!

741
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Father!

742
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Father!

743
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Cheng Ying!

744
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Uncle Jiang!

745
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Father!

746
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
What happened?

747
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,160
How could you be tied up here by Zi Dian?

748
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Where is mother?

749
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Why did she tie you up?

750
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Father!

751
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Let us go!

752
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
This is your mother's Zi Dian.

753
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
She is the owner of Zi Dian.

754
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I'm afraid she won't let me go.

755
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Mom,

756
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
don't let me go!

757
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Don't be scared!

758
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Do not let her go if you're not around.

759
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Come!

760
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Let us go,

761
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
put the bed on.

762
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Uncle!

763
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't know how long it will take.

764
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
There are more enemies coming.

765
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,440
Dad, let's go back and help him.

766
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,360
Let's go back, dad.

767
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,280
So lonely.

768
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,680
Dad, let's go back.

769
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,840
Dad.

770
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,440
Dad.

771
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,720
Listen up.

772
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,640
Don't turn the direction.

773
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,280
Don't go back to Lotus House.

774
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,440
After the funeral,

775
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,480
find a way to go to Meishan

776
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,960
and help your parents.

777
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,480
Dad.

778
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,400
Uncle Jiang.

779
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,480
Dad.

780
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,520
I'll go back and find three ladies.

781
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,760
Dad.

782
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,840
Let's go back and find mother, okay?

783
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,880
Dad.

784
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,000
You three must be fine.

785
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,000
Uncle Jiang.

786
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,960
Dad.

787
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,600
If anything happens to you,

788
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,520
we won't be fine.

789
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,720
Dad.

790
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Dad.

791
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Dad.

792
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Dad.

793
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Let me go.

794
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Why are you crying?

795
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I'm not going back.

796
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Dad.

797
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,680
Ah Lin.

798
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,280
I'm not crying.

799
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I'm not crying.

800
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Dad.

801
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Ah Ying.

802
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,480
You will watch

803
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,280
Ah Chen and Ah Lin carefully.

804
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,280
Dad.

805
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Uncle Jiang.

806
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Dad.

807
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
Hurry up and go back to Lotus House.

808
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Dad.

809
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Dad!

810
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Dad! Uncle Jiang!

811
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Dad!

812
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Dad!

813
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Dad!

814
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Dad!

815
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Dad!

816
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Dad!

817
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Dad!

818
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Uncle Jiang!

819
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Dad!

820
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,280
The rain has fallen, I have forgotten

821
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,280
How can I wait for you when I wake up?

822
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:28,280
How can I forget the rain in the red dust?

823
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,280
The snow is falling, the wind is cold

824
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,280
The mountains and the water are far away

825
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,280
The rain has fallen, the rain has fallen

826
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,280
The scenery is not clear, my flowers are like frost

827
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,280
The bamboo is like a tiger, I am torn into pieces

828
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,280
The moon is still there, why do I long for it?

829
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Why don't we laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh?

830
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,280
The leaves are like wind and waves, the sky is like a rain and the wind is like a rain

831
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:13,280
mogelijk- מחo處瓶喌传思悲 VID這一 ear

832
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:28,280
What if it's wonderful with a beautiful mind?
