1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The first one is the first one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The second one is the first one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The third one is the first one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The fourth one is the first one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The fourth one is the first one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The fifth one is the first one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The fifth one is the first one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The fifth one is the first one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The fifth one is the first one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The fifth one is the first one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The fifth one is the first one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fifth one is the first one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The fifth one is the first one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The fifth one is the first one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The fifth one is the first one.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The fifth one is the first one.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The fifth one is the first one.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fifth one is the first one.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The fifth one is the first one.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The fifth one is the first one.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The fifth one is the first one.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The fifth one is the first one.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fifth one is the first one.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fifth one is the first one.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fifth one is the first one.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The fifth one is the first one.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The fifth one is the first one.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fifth one is the first one.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fifth one is the first one.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fourth one is the first one.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Fundamentally,

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
we always draw the 2nd number book.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So it's easy to get 2nd and 3rd wrong.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm coming in.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why did you leave like that?

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Little rabbit, little rabbit.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can't raise a pet anywhere in life.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I just want to hide you here.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you still happy living here?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Happy.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, I'm relieved that you're happy living here.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Do you think

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I should bring you back to Lotus House?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, no, no.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If Lan Zhan is bored and wants to find you,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
he won't be able to find you.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But...

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wang Qin, be careful.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where is he going on his own?

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Is he going to find Yin Tie alone?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Do you think so too?

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Lan Zhan, you were there that day.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You saw it.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Your grand-grandmother was there.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That Yin Tie was found by us.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He wants to find Yin Tie alone.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He doesn't want me to be there.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You two should be reasonable.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Isn't he too unreasonable?

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ah Xian.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ah Xian.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sister.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What a cute rabbit.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You want me to take care of it?

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A man with a big belly and a rabbit.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm a man with a big belly and a rabbit.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A rabbit?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What are you doing?

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Little rabbit.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Dad said what are you doing with these little guys?

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You think you can't do it?

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You want to eat the rabbit meat, right?

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jiang Cheng, what are you talking about?

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Little rabbit can't listen to these words.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I just occasionally cut them.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't raise animals.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Where are you going to cut them?

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You don't have to care.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sister.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you like it,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
let's take one back.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If we take one back,

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it's not that we let him

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
separate from his family and loved ones.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How will he be happy

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
after that?

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, it's late.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go back.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Little rabbit,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
let's go.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's go.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wait for me.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's go back.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go back.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Childe Wen,

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
since you're here, please come in.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're so nice.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Childe Wen, you're here at midnight.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's the matter?

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's the matter?

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I heard from Wenjing that

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Lan's family is watching over Shennian.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is there something hidden?

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Lan's family is the only place where we can find our ancestors.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're afraid that we might bump into the immortal spirits.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Since you're so kind,

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll defeat you.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can you let me see it?

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Childe Wen,

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
please go back.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Lan Xichen,

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
don't be so selfish.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We can't help you.

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I might not be able to help you now.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But don't forget

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that Lan forgot that she just left the mountain alone.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Lan Xichen,

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
give the silver iron to the immortal spirits as soon as possible.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't let them get away with it.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll go and get it.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Lan Xichen,

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
give the silver iron to the immortal spirits as soon as possible.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't let them get away with it.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mengqi,

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
please be careful.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Nightfall,

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wei Wuxian,

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you bastard.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Bastard,

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you're not going to die?

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What's the matter?

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Father,

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
look.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Father, I'll go and get it back.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No need.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Shall we go back to the Clouds first?

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why?

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are you so careless?

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't worry.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A-Xin knows it's serious.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There must be something urgent

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to do with the farewell.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What could he do?

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Get ready.

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's go.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Lan Zhan.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're boring.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Lan Zhan.

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why are you like this?

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We said we wouldn't be able to make it.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How could you abandon me

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and start a business?

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you afraid

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll steal your weak point of view?

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't expect

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
you guys to be so petty.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Boring.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Tell me clearly.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Who's boring?

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Lan Zhan.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Lan Zhan,

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
wait for me.

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Lan Zhan.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is my own fortune.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A man can't be as far away as you.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
How is it?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is it fun?

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What should I give him a name?

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is it Tonghao?

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or Wu Yihao?

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't think so.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Or I'll call him

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Puru.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Puru.

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Lan Zhan,

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
wait for me.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The silver metal is moving.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How could he know?

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There might be another silver metal nearby.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you talking about the car?

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What?

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Nothing.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Nothing.

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Lan Zhan.

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you scared?

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Wu Xin.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Here.

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why are you here?

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I knew it when I heard this.

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sure it's you.

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Nie,

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
didn't you tell your chief Nie

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that you'll be back to Qinghe after school?

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Brother Nie,

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
we're like this.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're also going to the Lotus House with the chief Jiang?

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You're so arrogant.

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So arrogant.

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't be nervous.

207
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's go.

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Cheng.

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Be careful.

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Brother Wei,

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
why are you with Lan'er?

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Aren't you two

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
getting along so fast?

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's a long story.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I know.

216
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It must be you again.

217
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You're a good guy.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm good.

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What's over there?

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's go and see.

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's go.

222
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Lan Zhan,

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
why don't you go?

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Ji Yi,

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
don't go.

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't rush.

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Let's go and see.

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's go.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let's go.

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Young Master,

231
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
what are you looking at?

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's going on?

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Young Master,

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you know what you're doing.

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This is a gift.

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Recently,

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
a real flower girl who has been drinking and drinking

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
has suddenly been wandering around the world.

239
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
She went to the fake house to attend the meeting.

240
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I heard that

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
as long as there is a rich family in Fengya,

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
the real flower girl

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
will personally wear the present.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Real flower girl?

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I remember that

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I read in the 10-meter flower circle.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There are flowers in Tanzhou,

248
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
there are girls in the flower shop.

249
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The moon is down, there are masters.

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The masters' family

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
will give you a pair of real flowers.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's been three years.

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's a long-term experience.

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I said, Nian,

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
you are really amazing.

256
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Mr. Lan's work

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
can't even memorize a word.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You are a man of the word.

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You are a man of the word.

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Brother Wei,

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
let's go.

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Brother Wei, look.

263
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Brother Wei, look.

264
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Brother Wei, look.

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Brother Wei, look.

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Brother Wei, look.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Brother Wei, look.

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Brother Wei, look.

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Brother Wei, look.

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Brother Wei, look.

271
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Brother Wei, look.

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Brother Wei, look.

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Brother Wei, look.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Brother Wei, look.

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Brother Wei, look.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Brother Wei, look.

277
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:44,200
Brother

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Mr. Lan

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is such a rich person.

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A handsome young master.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:09,760
fairly

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,220
I'll do it.

283
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
God bilder.

284
00:18:35,440 --> 00:19:00,100
The

285
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,300
the

286
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Little bird.

287
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Wen Chao.

288
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Wen Chao is here.

289
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Wen Chao.

290
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Wen Chao.

291
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Wen Chao is here.

292
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
So that's how it is.

293
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,300
This Yin Iron makes Mudan the master of the flower,

294
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,300
instead of putting the real Flower Lady into it.

295
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,300
And she's trying to find other Yin Iron pieces

296
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,300
to make it more suitable for the world?

297
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Of course.

298
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Wei Xiu, this Yin Iron is really amazing.

299
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Of course.

300
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,300
How about we let Second Master take a look at the Yin Iron?

301
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
No, no, no.

302
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Wei Xiu, we can't afford to risk this Yin Iron.

303
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,300
It's not us.

304
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It's us.

305
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Wei Xiu, at least come back to Qing He with me.

306
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Look, it's so dangerous on the way.

307
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm alone...

308
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Wei Xiu, Wei Xiu.

309
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Little bird.

310
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
It's her again.

311
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Let's go.

312
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Wei Xiu, are you going to Qing He?

313
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Wei Xiu, wait for me.

314
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Master, the fairy tale is over.

315
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Yue Yang has been in a good mood for several days.

316
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
He's ordered us to help Yue Yang as soon as possible.

317
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
To help Xue Yang.

318
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Help?

319
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Xue Yang is a good thing.

320
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
It's worth helping me.

321
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
I'm just a secret agent.

322
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Don't be so fake.

323
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I'm just a secret agent.

324
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
I'm just a secret agent.

325
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm just a secret agent.

326
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I'm just a secret agent.

327
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Don't be so fake.

328
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
You think I don't know

329
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,300
that you just don't want me to find Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji's trouble?

330
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
What?

331
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,300
I've heard about it for months.

332
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm giving you a warning.

333
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Don't take the fairy tale as a bait.

334
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
I only want the Yin Iron from Lan Wangji.

335
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,300
And the piece I got from Shi Hua.

336
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,300
I've made a big contribution to the fairy tale.

337
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Xue Yang is a piece that's as good as me.

338
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,300
I almost forgot that you're not coming.

339
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
The Fan Mountain

340
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
is where you were born, right?

341
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
What do you want?

342
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
I don't want to do anything.

343
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,300
But Wei Wuxian will definitely pass by here on the way to Qinghe.

344
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
The county magistrate promised me

345
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
that he wouldn't hurt my family.

346
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Don't worry.

347
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
As long as you listen to me,

348
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
no one will have trouble.

349
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Go take care of that person's fault.

350
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,300
The Fan Mountain

351
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,300
is where you were born.

352
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
The Fairy Tale

353
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
It's okay.

354
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
It's okay.

355
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Here, have some.

356
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Miss Qing, the wine is coming out.

357
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Xiao'er, do you have any more?

358
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Give me a cup.

359
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Okay.

360
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Miss Wen, why are you here?

361
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Have a seat.

362
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Xiao'er, two bowls of soup.

363
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Xiao'er, we want two bowls of soup.

364
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Okay, have a seat.

365
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Xiao'er, I'll get some lily flower soup.

366
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Okay, have a seat.

367
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Xiao'er, we want lily flower soup too.

368
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Okay.

369
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,300
Xiao'er, hurry up.

370
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Let's go first.

371
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Sir.

372
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
Xiao'er, give them some.

373
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
We don't want it. Throw it away.

374
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
What are you doing? Are you trying to bribe me?

375
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Even if Qi Shan Wen is trying to bribe you,

376
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
what can we do?

377
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Stop!

378
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I have some.

379
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Sorry.

380
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Forget it.

381
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
The woman is...

382
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
dead.

383
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Look, there's a woman.

384
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
Let's go and ask her.

385
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Maybe we can take her out.

386
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
The woman is...

387
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
dead.

388
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Wife, we've passed this place.

389
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
We can't go anywhere.

390
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Can we take a night off here?

391
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Wife.

392
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Wife, we want to...

393
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,300
find a place to sleep.

394
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Sleep?

395
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Do you understand?

396
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Sleep.

397
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Wife.

398
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Wife.

399
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Let's go.

400
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Wife.

401
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
What's wrong?

402
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
I don't know.

403
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I think this place is weird.

404
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Wife.

405
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Wife.

406
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
The soul of a woman is dead.

407
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
She is alive.

408
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
She is alive.

409
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,300
What is she talking about?

410
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,300
What?

411
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,300
The soul of a woman is dead.

412
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
She is alive.

413
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Wife.

414
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,300
The soul of a woman is dead.

415
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Wife.

416
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
She is the woman of the five days.

417
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,300
Isn't this a normal sculpture?

418
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,300
It's not special except for the ugly smile.

419
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Is she really able to lock the soul?

420
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
Wife.

421
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
When I took the spirit stone,

422
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
no one saw me.

423
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Who are you? When did you come here?

424
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
I've been here all the time.

425
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,300
I should ask who you are.

426
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
Wife.

427
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
We've been here before.

428
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
We want to find a relative.

429
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
So we want to stay here for a night.

430
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Since we've been here,

431
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,300
let's leave early.

432
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Wife.

433
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,300
When did you get the soul of a woman?

434
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:44,300
The soul of a woman is a stone of the spirit of the heaven and earth.

435
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I don't know what happened.

436
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,300
I've gradually become the woman of the heaven.

437
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,300
I've been surrounded by people here.

438
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,300
But 20 years ago,

439
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,300
the five days of women started to break up.

440
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,300
They took the spirit stone.

441
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Although I was suppressed by a big family,

442
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,300
there were too many people who died.

443
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,300
It's getting more and more deserted here.

444
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Big family?

445
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
Wife.

446
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Who is the big family?

447
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Wife.

448
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,300
I can't remember.

449
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Wife.

450
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Is the big family the Wens of Qishan?

451
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
I can't remember.

452
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
You want to be a nun, right?

453
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Then sleep here.

454
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Maybe you understand everything.

455
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Wife.

456
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
I don't think I'm worried.

457
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,300
What five days of women is she laughing at me?

458
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Do you think she really can set up a spirit?

459
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Don't worry.

460
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Even if she's the god of the continent,

461
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
I...

462
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
I'm not worried.

463
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
I don't know what to do.

464
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
I'm worried.

465
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
I'm worried.

466
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Even if she's the god of the continent,

467
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
It's cold at night.

468
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Burn the fire.

469
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I'm not afraid of fire.

470
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Thank you, Wife.

471
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Wife.

472
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Wife.

473
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
What's the matter?

474
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
I... I just...

475
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
I had a nightmare.

476
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
We were...

477
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
She...

478
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Why did she suddenly die?

479
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Could it be that she's the god of the continent?

480
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Wife.

481
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Wife.

482
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
Lan Zhan.

483
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Lan Zhan.

484
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Did you say she looked at you?

485
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Shut up.

486
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Wife.

487
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
She's gone.

488
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
What should we do?

489
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
What else?

490
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Take this.

491
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Leave it to me.

492
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Thank you.

493
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Thank you for your kindness.

494
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Wife.

495
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Wife.

496
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
What's the matter?

497
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,300
They're all back.

498
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
They're all here.

499
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,300
What's this?

500
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,300
Isn't it the Martial Soul of the Five Heavens?

501
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Why are there more of them?

502
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
What's the matter with the Martial Soul of the Five Heavens?

503
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
They're all fools.

504
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
God, God, God.

505
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Help me, God.

506
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Help me, God.

507
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Lan Zhan.

508
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Help me, God.

509
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
surroundings.

510
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Laughing animals.

511
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
街 bike.

512
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
To snack.

513
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,300
Go give her water.

514
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Don't make a scene of our wedding.

515
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,300
biraz.

516
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
No one will believe her jokingly.

517
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
She's talking after Steve was shot.

518
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Theockμαvisor,

519
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
'm sure to say more.

520
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
I will not let you go.

521
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
I will not let you go.

522
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
I will not let you go.

523
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300

I will not let you go.

531
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
I will not let you go.

532
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
I will not let you go.

533
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
I will not let you go.

534
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
I will not let you go.

535
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
I will not let you go.

536
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
I will not let you go.

537
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
I will not let you go.

538
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,300
I will not let you go.

539
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,300
I will not let you go.

540
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I will not let you go.

541
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,300
I will not let you go.

542
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,300
I will not let you go.

543
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
I will not let you go.

544
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
I will not let you go.

545
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,300
I will not let you go.

546
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
I will not let you go.

547
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,300
I will not let you go.

548
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,300
I will not let you go.

549
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,300
I will not let you go.

550
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,300

I will not let you go.

560
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,300
I will not let you go.

561
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,300
I will not let you go.

562
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,300
I will not let you go.

563
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
