00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 06

3
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,440
What took you so long?

4
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
I grabbed some peanuts.

5
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,320
Bro Wei,

6
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,600
the liquor is really good.

7
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
Of course.

8
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,440
Here in Gusu, we shall drink the Emperor's Smile,

9
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,720
fragrant and mellow,

10
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,280
refreshing but not aggressive, smooth and powerful.

11
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,640
Just drink the liquor.

12
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,820
You make it sounds like you are describing a person.

13
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,040
Bro Jiang, I disagree.

14
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,920
I think Bro Wei is making an excellent point.

15
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,560
As a wise man said,

16
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,400
fine beauty is just like a great wine.

17
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
Cheers.

18
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
If that is true,

19
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,800
You shall find your partners by following the fragrance of liquor.

20
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,040
I will be fine,

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,280
as long as I have wine.

22
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,960
I don't know how the Lans from Gusu can put up with you.

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,960
Hey, I am adorable.

24
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,920
It is you.

25
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,960
No one can match your standards.

26
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,160
Bro Wei, what standards?

27
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,120
Wei Wuxian, I dare you!

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,360
Beauty, natural beauty.

29
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,800
Hey!

30
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Wei Wuxian!

31
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,920
Virtuous and caring.

32
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,440
And... Wei Wuxian!

33
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,680
comes from a good family.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,840
Stop it.

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
She should not be too chatty,

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
- and should have a gentle voice. -Stop running, Wei Wuxian.

37
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,520
- Be careful. - Stop running, Wei Wuxian.

38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,760
But not too capable.

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
There is more.

40
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,960
Should not burn through money.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,360
- You talk too much.  - Hey Hey Hey, it is okay.

42
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,120
Wei Wuxian!

43
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,720
Bro Jiang, get up.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,320
What are you guys doing?

45
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,200
What a happy coincidence.

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Since you are here,

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,160
Why not join us for a drink?

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Let's have a chat.

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Here at Cloud Recesses, alcohol is forbidden.

50
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,840
Lan Zhan,

51
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,640
don't be so rigid.

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,720
We succesfully expelled the Aqua Demon today.

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
It is an accomplishment.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,520
Let's celebrate.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,040
You three, go to the punishment chamber to be disciplined.

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
Where?

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,960
- What chamber? - What?

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
Lan Zhan, you see...

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,040
They are too drunk

60
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,400
too walk.

61
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,160
What if,

62
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
you sit down with me.

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Let's have a drink.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,040
And talk.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,680
Lan Zhan!

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,760
If you refuse to come with me,

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,160
I will ask help, and force it.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Lan Zhan?

69
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,200
Lan Zhan?

70
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,680
Lan Zhan?

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
Lan Zhan, come here.

72
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,480
Sit, and drink the wine.

73
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,880
See, I am not fooling you. Doesn't it taste great?

74
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,440
Lan Zhan?

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Wow, Lan Zhan, you have thick skins.

76
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,040
You won't even blush.

77
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Lan Zhan?

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Lan Zhan?

79
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,760
Can you please go back to your room?

80
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
Please do not sleep here.

81
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,640
Bet no one could imgine,

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
high and fine like you would one day follow to my leads.

83
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,720
Second Childe Lan, call me Brother Wei.

84
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
Brother Wei.

85
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
What's wrong?

86
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,160
Finally some reactions.

87
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
Your headband is tilted.

88
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,040
Tilted?

89
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,360
Let me help.

90
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,880
Go away.

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,280
It is still not right.

92
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,280
What?

93
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,960
I am just trying to help you to adjust.

94
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,320
Why are you so nervous?

95
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,960
Headband is sacred.

96
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,440
No one can touch it except for parents and significant others.

97
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600
Significant others?

98
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,080
What are you laughing at?

99
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,600
I am laughing at you, Gusu Lans.

100
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,480
So many rules, so rigid and pretentious.

101
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,720
No women would marry you.

102
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,720
You are gonna be alone by yourself forever.

103
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,160
That's fine.

104
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,400
Hey, is every member of your clan

105
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
that vapid?

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,320
Your father is as vapid as you.

107
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,280
Your mother must be so bored.

108
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,320
I don't have a mother.

109
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,160
That's impossible.

110
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,280
You can't be born out of the thin air.

111
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,520
My parents died when I was four.

112
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,800
You may think I should remember things then,

113
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
but I don't.

114
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,360
The only thing I remembered is being chased by wild dogs.

115
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,200
I don't remember

116
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,040
the look of my parents.

117
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,040
But I recall a scene,

118
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,760
I was riding on a donkey with my mom aside;

119
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
my father was right in front of us.

120
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,280
It might be that my mom cracked a joke,

121
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,040
and my father laughed.

122
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Lan Zhan,

123
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
here is to you.

124
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Not exactly. Here is to us,

125
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,000
May we never forget what is worth remembering,

126
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,760
or remember what is best forgotten.

127
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,760
Bottoms up.

128
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
Uncle, with all traveling, you must be exhausted.

129
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
How did the Cultivation Conference go?

130
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,880
We met with Clan Leader Nie.

131
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
As expected,

132
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,280
same demonic event has been happening in Qinghe.

133
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,280
Same red crackings

134
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,360
showed on those people's neck.

135
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,600
Do they have any clues?

136
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,960
Clan Leader Nie is looking into it.

137
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,120
Is everything okay in Cloud Recesses?

138
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Lately, the Wens have been quiet.

139
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
However, demonic event

140
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
was witnessed on Biling Lake.

141
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Tell me more about it.

142
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,080
I was just about to tell you that.

143
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
A couple days ago, a few students and I went to perform exorcism

144
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
on Biling Lake for water ghosts.

145
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Yet we found that the spirits in the lake

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,480
have been demonzied and become the Aqua Demon.

147
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,200
It has never happened before.

148
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,080
Childe Wei suspected that

149
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,640
It might have something to do with the snatched spirits.

150
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Childe Wei?

151
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,400
Wei Wuxian.

152
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,560
He is the elder disciple of Clan Leader Jiang.

153
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Is he

154
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,200
the son of...?

155
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,280
Right. He is the son of Wei Changze and Zangse Wanderer.

156
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,400
No wonder he is such a genie.

157
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,760
Just like his mother.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,680
Excuse me.

159
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,520
Master Lan,

160
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
Zewu Jun.

161
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,600
What is the problem?

162
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,920
Wei Wuxian sneaked in some liquors,

163
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,400
got drunk with a couple of students and got caught.

164
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,560
And Second Childe Lan was with them.

165
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,760
Wangji was with him?

166
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,360
How dare they.

167
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,400
Wangji is at fault.

168
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,880
Uncle and Brother, I shall be punished.

169
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Grand Master and Zewu Jun.

170
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,600
It is true that we disobeyed the rules and got drunk,

171
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,560
But Lan Zhan, he is not...

172
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,000
Nonsense!

173
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,520
Wei Wuxian.

174
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,160
Your confinement as a punishment was not even over yet,

175
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,920
here you are, causing troubles and disturbance again.

176
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
How far do you wanna take this?

177
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,440
Are you trying to ruin Cloud Recesses?

178
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Do not think that just because your mother is Zangse...

179
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,720
Grand Master.

180
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,280
Do you know my mother?

181
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Grand Master.

182
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,680
Shut up.

183
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,480
Wangji.

184
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
Childe Wei is not a member of the Lan clan.

185
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,120
But you are. And you are fully aware of the rules.

186
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Wangji recognizes the mistake that has been made.

187
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,400
Zewu Jun, Zewu Jun...

188
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,320
It was all on me. I made him drink the liquor.

189
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
It was against his will.

190
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,840
Wangji recognizes the mistake and shall be punished.

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,440
What is wrong with you? Why are you asking for punishment?

192
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,760
Wei Ying, as the head of the group,

193
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,880
shall be hit by bastinado three hundred times.

194
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,760
Same punishment to Lan Zhan.

195
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
The rest

196
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,840
shall be hit fifty times.

197
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
Let that be a warning.

198
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,880
Three... three hundred times.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,240
These bastinados are monstrous!

200
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
Am I gonna survive this?

201
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,240
Do it.

202
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,280
It hurts.

203
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,880
Cheng,

204
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,040
you are close to Xian and have always disciplined him.

205
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,440
Why did you fool around with him last night?

206
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,400
Sis, can we not talk about it anymore.

207
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,720
The fact that I got fifty hits

208
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,360
please keep it as a secret to our parents.

209
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
Three hundred hits for me

210
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,560
should also be kept as a secret.

211
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,800
You caused everything.

212
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,760
But no one forced you to drink the Emperor's Smile.

213
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,000
That's enough. Do you two wanna continue to fight?

214
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,560
Senior Sister.

215
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,840
It hurts everywhere.

216
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,960
Let it be a lesson to you.

217
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,760
Just endure it.

218
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Wait till the class ends,

219
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,600
I will make you Danggui soup.

220
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,720
Senior Sister.

221
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,280
I should have more proteins

222
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
to promote rapid healing.

223
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,960
Danggui soup with lamp should do the trick.

224
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,240
You two.

225
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,560
Zewu Jun.

226
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,880
Zewu Jun, did I break rules again?

227
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
You guys indeed went overboard last night.

228
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,560
But Uncle may be a bit harsh.

229
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
And so is the punishment.

230
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
The bastinado is quite heavy.

231
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
It probably will take weeks for

232
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,240
the wounds on your back to heal.

233
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,160
Weeks?! That's a long time...

234
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,960
Let me point to you a place to go

235
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,120
to heal a bit faster so you do not far behind in your studies.

236
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,920
Thank you for the support, Zewu Jun.

237
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,200
Zewu Jun.

238
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,280
My mother...

239
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Childe Wei.

240
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Back in the day, Zangse Wanderer was classmate with my uncle.

241
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
My uncle's behaviour was strictly mannered,

242
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
And you mother...

243
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,560
How should I say this...

244
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
She is just like you.

245
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,240
I hope you do not hold a grudge against my uncle.

246
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,000
It is true that he is being extra harsh on you.

247
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,160
It was just that...

248
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,280
Well, let's just say it was difficult for him

249
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,960
to keep his beard looking good back then.

250
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,070
= Biling Lake =

251
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,720
= The Aqua Demon =
= Biling Lake =

252
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,460
= Grey pupils appear =
= The Aqua Demon =
= Biling Lake =

253
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,600
It all makes sense now.

254
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,360
Yin Iron is in the water.

255
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,360
Lan Zhan.

256
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,240
Lan Zhan.

257
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,520
Lan Zhan.

258
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
How come you never told about a place like this?

259
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,080
Why didn't you share it with me?

260
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,840
That is not an act of a good friend.

261
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,880
How did you get in?

262
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,240
Zewu Jun let me in.

263
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,600
This is cold.

264
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,560
Really cold.

265
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,720
Bone-chilling. Bone-chilling.

266
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,040
Freezing.

267
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,360
Stop fumbling.

268
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,120
I know.

269
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,240
But the spring is freezing cold,

270
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,480
if I do not move around,

271
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
my blood will freeze,

272
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,360
so do the extremities.

273
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,440
Lan Zhan.

274
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,960
Lan Zhan

275
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,720
Hey you...

276
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,520
Alright, alright.

277
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,120
Though you are somewhat rigid, pedantic, and depressing

278
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,360
A little bit boring.

279
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,360
And I did not think too highly of you at the beginning.

280
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,720
But I changed my mind,

281
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,880
after our fights ended in a draw.

282
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,280
You are one of the people I approve.

283
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,240
And I wanna be friend with you.

284
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,600
That won't be necessary.

285
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,560
You are no fun.

286
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,320
Let me share something with you.

287
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,760
A lot of benefits come with being my friend.

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
What are you doing?

289
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
Getting undressed and start properly healing.

290
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,520
Please do not leave me here.

291
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,520
I will stop undressing.

292
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,480
Lan Zhan, have you ever been to Yunmeng?

293
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,880
There are a lot of fun things to do there.

294
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,880
Great food.

295
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,240
How about this?

296
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,040
If you ever visit the Lotus Cove,

297
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,120
I will pick lotus for you,

298
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,520
the seedpod, along with the water chestnut.

299
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,680
Never.

300
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,640
All right.

301
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,720
Let me tell you a big secret.

302
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,400
There are a lot of cuties in Yunmeng, pretty ladies.

303
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,240
Lan Zhan

304
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,720
Do you feel something strange happening?

305
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,480
Lan Zhan.

306
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,240
Lan Zhan, what is this place?

307
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Why is there a swirling tunnel beneath the Cold Spring?

308
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,480
What is this place? So weird.

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,920
The water is extremely cold but won't freeze.

310
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,120
Lan Zhan, wait up.

311
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
What is this thing?

312
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,440
Killer-String.

313
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,080
Killer-String?

314
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,760
Isn't that a peculiar trick of your clan?

315
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,560
What's happening?

316
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
Why are they all coming for me?

317
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,080
The graving on this Guqin is Lans' seal.

318
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,840
It will not attack me,

319
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,640
probably because it senses me as a member of the Lan clan.

320
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,680
How come this rabbit is wearing Lans' headband?

321
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
I heard that every member of Lan

322
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
wears a headband ever since they are child.

323
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,160
The headband recognizes the owner and has special power.

324
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,880
How come the rabbit wears the headband as well?

325
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Power...

326
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Headband.

327
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,280
Lan Zhan, the headband, hand over your headband.

328
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,720
Hurry.

329
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,680
I wanna take a closer look and see what it is.

330
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,200
It won't allow strangers to get near it.

331
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
Do not touch it.

332
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
This Guqin is a rare masterpiece

333
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,480
and it is enhanced by power.

334
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,880
It shall attack anyone who is not a member of the Lans.

335
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,000
It must belong to a member of the Lan clan, an ancestor.

336
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,200
I just want to take a look. I swear not to touch it.

337
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Drop it.

338
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,320
Be respectful,

339
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,280
to the heirloom.

340
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,120
How can I get a good look without picking it up?

341
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,360
I have my way.

342
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,080
Ask the spirit.

343
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,680
I have heard of the sorcerous act.

344
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
A unique skill only the Lan can execute.

345
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,040
Talk with the deceased through string art.

346
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,960
It is her.

347
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Who is it?

348
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,600
Wen clan of Qishan

349
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,160
Lan clan of Gusu

350
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,000
Jiang clan of Yunmeng

351
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,320
Jin clan of Lanling

352
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,840
Nie clan of Qinghe

353
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,120
Kill the gentry, and destroy the Yin Iron.

354
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,800
Kill the gentry, and destroy the Yin Iron.

355
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,320
Lan Zhan, what is that voice?

356
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,640
I do not know. Be careful.

357
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,560
Xue Chonghai, hand the Yin Iron over.

358
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,240
Sounds like the Five families

359
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
they were trying to decimate certain school.

360
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,400
Yin Iron? What is it?

361
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,560
I have never heard of it.

362
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,640
Yin Iron is cursed, not worth mentioning.

363
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,160
= Lan Yi from Lan clan of Gusu =

364
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,880
Uncle.

365
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,320
It is possible that Wangji and Childe Wei are just fine

366
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,040
and nothing happens.

367
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,440
I have sent people out to look for them.

368
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,000
Wangji has always been diligent, ever since he was a boy.

369
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,760
He would never fool around like Wei Ying.

370
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,440
Yet now, both of them disappeared in the Cold Spring...

371
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,120
I am worried... that...

372
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,720
Uncle, are you worried that...?

373
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
A storm is coming.

374
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
Second Childe Lan, Childe Wei

375
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,720
Second Childe Lan, Second Childe Lan...

376
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,400
Childe Wei, Childe Wei...

377
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,240
Second Childe Lan... Childe Wei...

378
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,480
Childe Wei... Second Childe Lan...

379
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,000
Second Childe Lan... Childe Wei...

380
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,200
Childe Wei...  Second Childe Lan... Second Childe Lan...

381
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,240
Sis.

382
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Sis.

383
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,440
You stay here and take a break.

384
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,040
I will bring some help and look over there.

385
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,720
Childe Wei... Second Childe Lan...

386
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,960
Second Childe Lan... Childe Wei...

387
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
Childe Wei... Second Childe Lan...

388
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,040
Second Childe Lan... Childe Wei...

389
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,440
Cheng,

390
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,240
Please find them.

391
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Be assured, sis.

392
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,400
I will find him

393
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,720
and break his legs.

394
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,240
Watch out, Lady Jiang.

395
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,560
Your highness.

396
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
Lan Zhan, descendant from the Lan clan.

397
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,880
So, she is the one?

398
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,440
The only female clan leader of Gusu Lan,

399
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,080
whom created the Killer-String sorcerous act.

400
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Lan Yi.

401
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,880
Wei Ying, disciple from the Jiang clan.

402
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,920
Your highness.

403
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,960
Predecessor

404
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
so these rabbits with headbands

405
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,960
are raised by you.

406
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,120
They were here to keep my company.

407
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,280
But my energy is fading away throughout the years.

408
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,360
They are too fond of play and thus often come out.

409
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,160
Ma'am,

410
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,960
The rumor was that you had passed away years ago.

411
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,600
How come...?

412
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,800
It must have something to do with the Yin Iron.

413
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
It was my biggest mistake,

414
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,200
in my lifetime.

415
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,160
And I paid the price.

416
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
With all my power,

417
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,520
I kept the Yin Iron in containment.

418
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,280
Predecessor,

419
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,640
what's Yin Iron

420
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,880
and

421
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,360
where are the shouting and pounding noises coming from?

422
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,480
The seal is cracking as the power gets weaker.

423
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,640
My energy is dying.

424
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
And here you are.

425
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,120
It may be destined.

426
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Predecessor?

427
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,120
Hundreds years ago,

428
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,040
when the Yin Iron was not fragments, but a whole.

429
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,640
Yiling Burial Mounds back then was a celestial land.

430
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,200
And Xue Chonghai

431
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,720
was the most powerful grand master back then.

432
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,880
A hundred years has passed,

433
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
Nobody knows,

434
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,080
why someone like Xu Chonghai, who had everything

435
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,760
would use the Iron to absorb grievance and resentment,

436
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,640
and use living people as sacrifice.

437
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,120
He controlled an ancient monster, Xuanwu, the slaughter

438
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,480
Blood was shed.

439
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,630
Lives were taken.

440
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,190
It was a great tragedy.

441
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,630
So the Five families united.

442
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,080
They killed Xue Chonghai.

443
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,630
You are as smart as I have expected, Childe Wei.

444
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,280
Xue Chonghai was executed, and Xuanwu was put down.

445
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,600
Dead bodies were everywhere.

446
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,920
And Yilin, this once celestial land

447
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,360
became a massive burial ground.

448
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,120
Predecessor,

449
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,360
What happened to Yin Iron after that?

450
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,710
Yin Iron has snatched and absorbed too many living spirits,

451
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,320
the grievances were too heavy to be dissipated.

452
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,360
Snatching spirits?

453
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,640
That is right.

454
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,840
Yin Iron was a rare treasure naturally grown.

455
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,920
It was able to absorb energy from the universe.

456
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,600
Yet Xue Chonghai fed it

457
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,120
with the living spirits,

458
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,640
even gentries with power.

459
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,000
The Yin Iron was filled with grievance and rencor.

460
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,040
The change was irreversible.

461
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,680
Hand the Yin Iron over.

462
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,960
Wen Mao,

463
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,080
You will end up like me.

464
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,240
just like me!

465
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,880
Later on, the five families

466
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,560
decided to suppress it.

467
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,600
And thus broke the Yin Iron into pieces

468
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,600
placed them into different locations that are full of good energy.

469
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,320
To avoid anyone to follow the same rut,

470
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,120
the Five clans made an agreement,

471
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,480
never spoke of the Yin Iron again

472
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,240
With all due respect,

473
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,560
if the Yin Iron can

474
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,880
truly absorb natural energy,

475
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,360
we may be able to turn it

476
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,640
into a good use.

477
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,280
Wei Ying.

478
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,040
I am surprised.

479
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,360
What you just said was the same as

480
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,160
what I had thought.

481
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,120
Being a woman

482
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,400
ever since I succeeded to be the Leader of Lans,

483
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,160
people never stopped criticizing.

484
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,560
We were experiencing reconstruction of the clan.

485
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,920
For years I tried to break the old rule,

486
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,040
and find ways to innovate.

487
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,080
All my life I was fighting to revitalize the Lans clan.

488
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,160
Yet I faced so many impediments and obstacles.

489
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,040
And one day,

490
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,240
when I was having a chat with my friend, Bao Shan,

491
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,600
she mentioned Yin Iron by accident.

492
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,160
Bao... Bao Shan?

493
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,320
Ma'am you are acquaintance to Bao Shan?

494
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,320
She was my best friend, dearest to my heart.

495
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,800
But I...

496
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,120
Failed her.

497
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,720
Why do you say so?

498
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Ever since I learned about Yin Iron,

499
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,960
I could not sleep.

500
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,560
I dived into Lans' book collections.

501
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
And I was able to put the clues together.

502
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,000
I found the hiding place

503
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,600
where that Lans' ancestors

504
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,000
stored the fragment of the Yin Iron.

505
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,840
Cold Spring Cave is full of natural energy.

506
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,160
The cold streams of air from all directions merge here,

507
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,680
and condensed into a pond of cold water that will never freeze.

508
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,840
It was not only the source of the Cold Spring

509
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,600
but also the best place to seal the Yin Iron.

510
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,120
So this is the place

511
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,040
where you found a fragment of the Yin Iron.

512
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,760
If Yin Iron cannot be mutualized,

513
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,680
How come you wanna find it?

514
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,920
I thought the way you did, Childe Wei

515
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,160
I was young and naive.

516
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,280
I ignored the warnings.

517
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,680
The fear was it couldn't be controlled, but you may be controlled instead.

518
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,400
Bao Shang told me the same thing.

519
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,040
But I had always done thing my own way,

520
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,360
and ask for a clear conscience.

521
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,120
I thought I was doing the right thing.

522
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,120
I wanted to promote Lans sorcery and heirloom.

523
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,480
I ignored her warning

524
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,480
and broke into the forbidden ground.

525
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,960
Unfortunately,

526
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,760
At the end of the day, I was wrong.

527
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,120
What happened?

528
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
Did Master Baoshan know about this?

529
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,720
= Baoshan Wanderer =

530
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,350
Lan Yi,
= Baoshan Wanderer =

531
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:17,400
Lan Yi,

532
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,120
Do you know what may happen

533
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
because of your decision.

534
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
I am not doing this for myself.

535
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,160
I am doing it for the Clan.

536
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,640
Why are you trying to stop me?

537
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,840
Yin Iron is extremely malicious.

538
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,120
No one has successfully purify it before.

539
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Have you ever thought about it,

540
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,120
if you break the seal but cannot control the thing,

541
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,960
What then...

542
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,680
As the Leader of the Lans clan,

543
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,200
I created the Killer-String.

544
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,880
Just because no one had done it before,

545
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,240
it doesn't mean I cannot make it happen.

546
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,600
You...

547
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,680
You can probably tell what happened next.

548
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,600
I could not mutualize Yin Iron.

549
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,760
Not only that

550
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,680
I made a terrible mistake.

551
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,960
Once the seal on the Yin Iron is broken,

552
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,040
It can never be redone.

553
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,880
I tried countless times,

554
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,960
All failed.

555
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,760
As a result,

556
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,400
I was injured badly.

557
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Yin Iron was sealed here temporarily with all my energy.
