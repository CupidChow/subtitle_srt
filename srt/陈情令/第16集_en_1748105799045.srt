00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,280
I thought you were awake.

86
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,760
I didn't sleep after taking a nap.

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
It's called what, I like it all.

92
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,200
I was so scared today.

93
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Luckily, Wen Zhu Liu protected you.

94
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,960
This bitch, she is also a living being.

95
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,160
When she was in the family,

96
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,600
she was forced to marry her.

97
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,240
But what use is she to marry her?

98
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,360
She doesn't like her.

99
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,200
She has been a wife for more than ten years.

100
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
Everyone is laughing at her behind her back.

101
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
She doesn't know how to look at her face.

102
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,520
She is a coward.

103
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,320
Now, she is a burden.

104
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Really?

105
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,720
How can I see how she is so confident?

106
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Why doesn't Jiang Feng Mian like her?

107
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,360
Do you have to say that?

108
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,720
A woman's family

109
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,800
always has a whip to hit others' ears.

110
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
She doesn't even have a little bit of education.

111
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
If Jiang Feng Mian marries her,

112
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
it's really a waste of my life.

113
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,360
Exactly.

114
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
A woman

115
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,800
should be like my Jiaojiao.

116
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,520
She is gentle, cute, obedient and sensible.

117
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,480
She is like me.

118
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,960
I am not like you.

119
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,240

My father's body is still in the spiritual house.

Where can I go if I don't go back?

169
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
What can you do when you're back?

170

They even killed Uncle Jiang and Mrs. Yun.

171
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
You'll die if you go back.

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
I'll die if I die.

173
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
You're afraid that you can die.

Yes.

186
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
I'll take good care of you.

187
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Shut up.

188
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
You're a good man.

189
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Why?

190
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Why?

191
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Tell me why?

192
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Why did you save them?

193
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Are you happy now?

194
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
I've told you many times.

195
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Don't be a hero.

196
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Look at you now.

197
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
You're a hero.

198
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Are you happy now?

199
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Are you happy now?

200
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Don't forget that they'll die if you tell them.

201
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
They'll die.

202
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
None of us matters.

203
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
You just let them die.

204
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Why did you do that to them?

205
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Now that Yun Meng is back,

206
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
my parents are gone.

207
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Are you happy now?

208
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Why?

209
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Why?

210
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
I want my parents.

211
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
I want my parents.

212
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
I want my brothers.

213
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Now they're gone.

214
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm gone.

215
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm gone.

216
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm gone.

217
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm gone.

218
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm gone.

219
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
I'm gone.

220
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Master Wen,

221
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
all the rooms are searched.

222
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
The treasure is 2400 pieces.

223
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
It's in the closet.

224
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Okay.

225
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Okay.

226
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
It should be a big celebration.

227
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
I think we should close the banquet here tonight.

228
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
It's not a big deal.

229
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Congratulations, Master Wen.

230
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
You're the master of Lotus Cove.

231
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
How can I call it Lotus Cove?

232
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
I've changed my name.

233
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
From today,

234
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Yun Meng is the master of Lotus Cove.

235
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Master Wen.

236
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Yes.

237
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Have you found Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian?

238
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I haven't found their trace.

239
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
We can't let them escape.

240
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Otherwise, they'll be helpless.

241
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
They should be far away.

242
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
They should go to catch them.

243
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Yes.

244
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Clean this place up.

245
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Yes.

246
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I'm going to the palace.

247
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
I'm going to the palace.

248
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I'm going to the palace.

249
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
I'm going to the palace.

250
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm going to the palace.

251
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I'm going to the palace.

252
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm going to the palace.

253
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm going to the palace.

254
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
I'm going to the palace.

255
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm going to the palace.

256
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
I'm going to the palace.

257
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm going to the palace.

258
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm going to the palace.

259
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
I'm going to the palace.

260
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
I'm going to the palace.

261
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm going to the palace.

262
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm going to the palace.

263
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm going to the palace.

264
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm going to the palace.

265
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
This place is a theatre.

266
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
This place is...

267
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
in front of the palace?

268
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,620
Shiji is missing.

269
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,320
I will tell her that she's not living.

270
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,440
Compared to before, I've keel a hundred times.

271
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,980
Don't forget about her.

272
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,960
That sister is waiting for us to find her.

273
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,980
Dead?

274
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,340
Rios...

275
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:17,100
Twentyissa Thies

276
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,220
Shijie

277
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,340
How is she?

278
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,560
Oh my god!

279
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:49,260
Here we come forth!

280
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:56,300
Um

281
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,660
Ah Xi

282
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,480
you tell me

283
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,160
So, I'm never sleeping here anymore.

284
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,240
She must be so bored today and I'm not!

285
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,560
If you go into sleep again you'll lose your Philip book...

286
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:57,260
I have problems trying to pry against her because I'm so Bauhakist.

287
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,120
You'll have to go if this doesn't work better for you.

288
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,900
You know everything,ेi xè lè içidence, combines my blood and your regrets...

289
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

290
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

291
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

292
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

293
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

294
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

295
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

296
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

297
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

298
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

299
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,900
The letter...

300
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
The letter...

301
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
I can't believe it.

302
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
It's a letter.

303
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I can't believe it.

304
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
It's a letter.

305
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
I think that I have a problem.

306
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I think that I have a problem.

307
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Take it.

308
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Take it.

309
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
You're very heavy.

310
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I'll buy you medicine.

311
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
You don't have to worry.

312
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
You don't have to worry.

313
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:20,900
I will not let you run away.

314
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,900
I'm not sure if I can get to the top of the mountain.

315
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
Jiang Cheng,

316
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Senior Sister is very ill.

317
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,900
I'll go buy some medicine for Senior Sister.

318
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Senior Sister will take care of you.

319
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
You must stay here.

320
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Don't leave, okay?

321
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Senior Sister

322
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Senior Sister

323
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Be careful!

324
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Don't let the person who escaped out of the house!

325
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Boss, five cigarettes.

326
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Senior Sister

327
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Catch them! Don't stay here!

328
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Let's go!

329
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,900
No, I've been sleeping here for so long.

330
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,900
I must hurry back to the inn and take them away from here.

331
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Jiang Cheng!

332
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Senior Sister

333
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Senior Sister

334
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Senior Sister

335
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Senior Sister, Jiang Cheng is gone. Where is he going?

336
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Jiang Cheng is gone?

337
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Hurry up!

338
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Where did you see him go with me?

339
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
He came with you.

340
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
I saw him come here earlier.

341
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,900
I didn't notice that there were too many customers.

342
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
He should have left.

343
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
He's gone.

344
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
He's gone.

345
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Where is he going?

346
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,900
What should we do? What should we do now?

347
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
He must have come back to the inn.

348
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
We must bring him back.

349
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
He can't be in the inn anymore.

350
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,900
He can't be in the inn anymore.

351
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Senior Sister, you can't go.

352
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Listen to me.

353
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,900
You go to Liu Po Po's place and wait for a while, okay?

354
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Don't go.

355
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Where are you waiting for me?

356
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
I promise you.

357
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,900
I will bring Jiang Cheng back.

358
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I promise.

359
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,900
You can't do anything else.

360
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
You promise me.

361
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
Okay.

362
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
I promise you.

363
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
I won't do anything.

364
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,900
But you must promise me.

365
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
You must find Jiang Cheng.

366
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,900
You must bring him back.

367
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,900
We three go to the inn together, okay?

368
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Okay.

369
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
Okay.

370
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Brother.

371
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Don't move.

372
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
I will kill you.

373
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
I will kill you.

374
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Don't say that.

375
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,900
I don't need to say that.

376
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Look at my face.

377
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
Wen Ning.

378
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Did you join the training club?

379
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,900
Did you say that you were going to do something?

380
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I shouldn't have asked you that.

381
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Master Wei, I didn't.

382
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I heard the news and I rushed over.

383
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
I just arrived.

384
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
I know.

385
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
I rushed over.

386
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,900
But it's too late.

387
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
I will go back.

388
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Master Wei, you are here to find Mr. Jiang, right?

389
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
What did you say?

390
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
You saw Jiang Cheng?

391
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
I just came back from the Wen Dynasty.

392
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Jiang Cheng is in there?

393
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Yes.

394
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Jiang Cheng is in there?

395
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
I can't believe that.

396
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
Wen Ning is a hostage.

397
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
But he is a hostage.

398
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,900
If I want to kill him, I can only kill him.

399
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,900
Master Wei, you are here to save Mr. Jiang, right?

400
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
What else?

401
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,900
I can help you save him.

402
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,900
You can protect me?

403
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,900
I can help you take him out now.

404
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
You can save him.

405
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,900
I and my sister are in the same room.

406
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,900
But there is a bunch of people in the hall.

407
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Can you help me save Jiang Cheng?

408
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,900
And you and Mrs. Yu.

409
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Take him out.

410
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,900
I will do my best.

411
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Who is it?

412
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Is it Mr. Wen Ning?

413
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
This is for Mr. Jiang.

414
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
I will check it.

415
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Why are you here from the Yiling?

416
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Have you seen Mr. Jiang?

417
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
I heard that Mr. Jiang killed Jiang.

418
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
So I came to see him.

419
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,900
You don't need to worry.

420
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
I will go to see Mr. Jiang now.

421
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
He really thinks of himself as a master.

422
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
I am here to save you.

423
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Sit down.

424
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Sit down.

425
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Sit down.

426
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,900
Don't go.

427
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,900
Jiang is always our Wens.

428
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
Wen Zhu Liu.

429
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Wen Zhu Liu.

430
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Why don't you drink?

431
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,900
This is the biggest merit of the Wens.

432
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,900
What?

433
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,900
Don't drink.

434
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
Good.

435
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Wen Zhu Liu.

436
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Good.

437
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Good.

438
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
That's right.

439
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Everyone.

440
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Come on.

441
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Why am I here?

442
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
The world is still waiting for me.

443
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
I have to protect it.

444
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
But where is Jiang Cheng?

445
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Will Wen Ning lie to me?

446
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,900
What if she lies to me?

447
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Jiang Cheng is not here.

448
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
I will go to see him.

449
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
I will go to see him.

450
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,900
I will go to see him.

451
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
I will go to see him.

452
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
I will go to see him.

453
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I will go to see him.

454
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Jiang Cheng is not here.

455
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
No.

456
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,900
Jiang Cheng is not here.

457
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
I will go to see him.

458
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
I will go to see him.

459
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,900
I will go to see him.

460
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
I will go to see him.

461
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
I will go to see him.

462
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
I will go to see him.

463
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
I will go to see him.

464
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
I will go to see him.

465
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
I will go to see him.

466
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,900
I will go to see him.

467
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
I will go to see him.

468
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,900
I will go to see him.

469
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,900
I will go to see him.

470
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
I will go to see him.

471
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,900
I will go to see him.

472
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
I will go to see him.
