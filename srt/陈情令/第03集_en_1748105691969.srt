00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 34

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Deng Xiaosue, what is going on?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you suddenly talking to us?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sir, we have no other way out.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There is a big gentleman today.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He has even wrapped the entire inn.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He is not from the person they are from.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He can't leave any one of them.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, sir,

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
let's go to another inn and rest.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Sir, you're here.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,840
According to your order, the room is all set.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
We've already moved the other guests.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,000
Please give these boxes to our manager,

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
and prepare the ingredients for the cutting.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,160
You can avoid the dust.

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,080
You're right.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,840
Sir will like you.

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,720
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
You need to be more precise.

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,480
Our boss is not a small business.

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Don't worry.

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Let's go upstairs and see the boss' room.

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,400
Sir, this way, please.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,160
It's Lanlin's Jin's room.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,080
I think it's also here to listen to the students.

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,600
The student council is here.

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,880
Please step down.

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
Senior, these people are the only ones in Jin's room.

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
They've already taken the whole room.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,720
They even drove us away.

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,880
The other guests are full.

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
We can't go out.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
The next day

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
Miss Mian Mian.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,800
Can you give me a box of this?

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Who are you?

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Who told you to call me Mian Mian?

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
It's her.

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,280
She called you Mian Mian.

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,600
Why can't I?

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,320
Who are you?

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,720
Don't call me that.

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,600
No need to.

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,600
Why don't you tell me your name?

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
I won't call you Mian Mian.

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,040
Why do you ask me?

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Before I ask others,

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
please tell me your name.

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
Okay.

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,080
I said it.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Remember.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,480
My name is Yuan Dao.

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Yuan Dao?

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Mian Mian.

85
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,720
Do you remember the name of the teacher?

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
It's not a name.

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,920
It's not a name.

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
You...

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
You're tricking me.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
What's wrong?

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Think about it.

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
What's the next word?

93
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
Mian Mian is Yuan Dao.

94
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,200
Why did you say it?

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
Who killed you?

96
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
I don't want to talk about it.

97
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,480
You're from the Lanling Jin clan, right?

98
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
You said that the girl from the Lanling Jin clan

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,160
is beautiful and virtuous.

100
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,560
You're so different today.

101
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,160
You're so drunk.

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm Yun Meng Jiang.

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm from Wei Ying and Wei Wuxian.

104
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
I went to the Lan clan's school in Gusu.

105
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,080
I studied in the study of medicine.

106
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm from the same school.

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,080
Mian Mian must be a little bit different.

108
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,240
So, this Yuan Dao

109
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,800
has another name that can be heard.

110
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
But...

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,720
Is this the room?

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mian Mian.

113
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
You're not the same.

114
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,360
You can't use these rooms.

115
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
They came here first.

116
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
Since you're not going to stay here,

117
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
you don't need to know about my son.

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,360
Thank you, Miss Wei.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,960
Only you can get to the room

120
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,200
with your pure and romantic look.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Senior, what did you hear her say?

122
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,920
Jiang Cheng, I think

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,080
you're jealous of me and envy me.

124
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,040
Why don't you just

125
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
play a game here?

126
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,040
Why don't you two play here?

127
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,160
But, Senior,

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
who is the golden prince in Mian Mian's mouth?

129
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,400
Who else?

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,920
He's from Lanling Jin clan.

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Except for the youngest prince,

132
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Jin Zi Xuan.

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Who else?

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,280
I just don't know if this golden prince

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
is like a child.

136
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
He's so talented.

137
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,120
Excuse me, sir.

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
The room in the small hall is not enough.

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,880
Please let me out of these rooms.

140
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,320
Mr. Jin.

141
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,320
This is the best inn in Caiyu Town.

142
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,600
Yes, Mr. Jin.

143
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,040
It's not as good as the Golden Forest.

144
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,200
This chair is made of wood.

145
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
And this cup

146
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,640
is made of a lot of green and purple.

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,880
This is the tea.

148
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
Go to the room.

149
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
Sir, this way.

150
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,840
Surer.

151
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,720
I see.

152
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,640
You grew up here.

153
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,520
Yes.

154
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,320
But I didn't wanna stay with her.

155
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,040
So, what are your name?

156
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,460
Awesome!

157
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,900
You wanna learn from me, too?

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,740
But not my idea.

159
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,440
You don't know me that well.

160
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,500
You can try.

161
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,140
Come on.

162
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,440
Let's run home.

163
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
We're notizing you.

164
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,500
Let's do as you say.

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,560
OK.

166
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,180
Well,

167
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,140
You have improved a lot,

168
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,820
And specially,

169
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,000
All of your previous programs

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You should tell the shopkeeper.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We've already packed this inn.

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We don't want to be together with some dirty people.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Every fairy can only bring a few people in the blue world.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This young master is so kind.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Why did he bring so many people?

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We are all master's servants. What's wrong?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The blue spirit is really big.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I just heard that the Gu Su Lan family is strict and hardworking.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This young master is so kind.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He even brings so many people.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm really worried about this young master.

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can't bear this pain.

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ah Xin.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Sister.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just gave him a good hint.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How dare you say something so rude to our young master?

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's the reason for Yun Meng Jiang's death?

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Tell me.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And tell me.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Tell me.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Tell me.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Tell me.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tell me.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Tell me.

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Tell me.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ah Xin.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Ah Cheng.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Pack up your luggage.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We'll look for him.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Young master.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Goodbye.

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Young master, your room is over there.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Young Miss Jiang is sorry.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I moved into the wrong room.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Forgive me.

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Miss Jiang, forgive me. I went to the wrong room.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why did you say you went to the wrong room?

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Isn't the whole room of the inn yours?

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I've heard that Nan Ling Jin is very popular in the capital.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now it seems that it's just like that.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Jin Zi Xuan is really a good person.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Exactly. He's like a flower bud.

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a pity that I didn't even touch the wine bottle in Tian Zi Xiao's shop.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When did he still remember the wine?

218
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Didn't you see his expression?

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Miss Jiang,

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
why did you go to the wrong room?

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know what Uncle Jiang really thinks.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why does he have to let the world marry that flower bud?

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Gu Sulan is a good person.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He came here to beg for help.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He didn't have a bow. He can't enter.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Brother, I've told you many times.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We lost our bow accidentally.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We definitely didn't lose it on purpose.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And look, we're all living here.

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can we still be fake?

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mr. Zhou, I can't confirm your identity without bowing.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Look, the sun is about to fall.

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why can't you look at the street?

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How about this?

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Please invite your family.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They've seen our senior sister.

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They'll know we're telling the truth.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Please wait here.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We'll see you in the room when we have time.

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Time to have time?

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The sun is about to fall.

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
A Xian, don't be rude.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But senior sister...

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
My father passed away.

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No matter when, we can't lose our share.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's leave the mountain gate first.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We'll make a plan.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why did he hide his mother and brother with the spirit?

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Enough.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Listen now.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Mr. Zhou, your mother is back,

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
she's here to do the magic.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,800
This...

254
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
This man, Mr. Two,

255
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
must be Lanshi Shuangbi's Lann Wangqin.

256
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,840
Lanshi's family member, Lanshi Chen.

257
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,240
He must have allowed them in.

258
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,640
This is...

259
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,680
Bring them in first.

260
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
Why are they so miserable?

261
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Dead? I don't see them.

262
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,760
What kind of evil tree do you want?

263
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Evil tree?

264
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,600
Second Young Master,

265
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm Jiang Shi,

266
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
the son of Jiang Feng Mian,

267
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,600
Jiang Cheng.

268
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,200
My sister, Jiang Yanli,

269
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,160
is not present at the camp.

270
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,120
I want to see you.

271
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,680
Come in.

272
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Second Young Master,

273
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,080
we're not alone.

274
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,400
It's late now.

275
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,120
The road is not good.

276
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,920
Second Young Master, please forgive me.

277
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,520
We can't enter without a bow.

278
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,200
Second Young Master,

279
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,680
we've been in a dream all the way.

280
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,320
We've been in a long-distance journey.

281
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,600
We finally got to the place

282
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,840
where we were before sunset.

283
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
It's too much to

284
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,520
have a bow

285
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,360
outside the door.

286
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,960
We can't enter without a bow.

287
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,720
Second Young Master,

288
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
we lost it accidentally.

289
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,520
We didn't mean it.

290
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,760
Please forgive us.

291
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
Find the knife.

292
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Second Young Master,

293
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,880
the sun is about to set.

294
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,440
The clouds are so bright

295
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
that we don't know where it is.

296
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,000
It's more than 20 miles away.

297
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,480
It's too hard

298
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,120
to find us now.

299
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
Second Young Master,

300
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,120
we can't...

301
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,160
You've been forbidden by Second Young Master.

302
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,760
You can't untie the rope.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
You have to hold it in place

304
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,160
and untie it.

305
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,840
You have to wear it.

306
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,360
You have to take it.

307
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,980
Slowly,

308
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
as if you don't want to hurt yourself.

309
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,080
Your红柴站

310
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,840
will pull you

311
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,240
down.

312
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
Nothing bad too.

313
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
I am afraid that...

314
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,240
Supervisor,

315
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,680
I can't

316
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,960
wear it all the time.

317
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Don't put it in your heart.

318
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I didn't put it in my heart.

319
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
But with A Xian's personality,

320
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm afraid that you'll make things difficult for him.

321
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
As long as he doesn't bother others,

322
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
how can others make things difficult for him?

323
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
He might be with some people now,

324
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
some distant friends.

325
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Cheng, you know,

326
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
when A Xian meets the right person,

327
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
he will never make a fool of himself.

328
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Second Young Master Lan.

330
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Senior Sister.

331
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Jiang Cheng.

332
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Why is there no one?

333
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
No wonder there's no one.

334
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
This knot is just for breaking.

335
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Oh.

336
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
What a coincidence.

337
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
We meet again.

338
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Second Young Master Lan.

339
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
You came out so late.

340
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You came out to watch the moon?

341
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Second Young Master Lan.

342
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I came to see my Senior Sister.

343
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Oh, right.

344
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I found the invitation.

345
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
It's in my pocket.

346
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Let me show you.

347
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
The knot is broken.

348
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
The Blue Stone is in the way.

349
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
The night is only a momentary silence.

350
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
The Blue Stone is in the way.

351
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
The Red Stone is in the way.

352
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
The Blue Stone is in the way.

353
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Second Young Master Lan.

354
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
It's my first time to come to your Gu Su Lan's room.

355
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
I really don't know many rules.

356
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
But I swear

357
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I will never make a fool of myself again.

358
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
And I'm also anxious

359
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
to see Senior Sister Jiang Cheng.

360
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
How about this?

361
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Let me go in and have a look.

362
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I'll have a look.

363
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
How about this?

364
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Tian Zi Xiao.

365
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I'll give you a talk.

366
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Don't you see my image?

367
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
The most righteous person in the jade palace.

368
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Second Young Master Lan.

369
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You don't have to be so unreasonable.

370
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
You didn't share the red and white

371
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
with me at the gate of the mountain.

372
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Anyway,

373
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
you have some responsibility.

374
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I'll go in and have a look.

375
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I didn't expect this little Gu Ban

376
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
to be so good at Kung Fu.

377
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I still have some work to do.

378
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I won't play with you anymore.

379
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I'll go in and have a look.

380
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Lan Zhan.

381
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
You accompany me to Tian Zi Xiao.

382
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Turn around.

383
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
What's this?

384
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Gu Su Lan Shi Jia Gui.

385
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
So many?

386
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Put the wine down.

387
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Even if you come to the school,

388
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
you must have cooked a lot of Lan Shi Jia Gui.

389
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I said,

390
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
it's good that I didn't have

391
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,200
such a scary Gu Su Lan Shi in your life.

392
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm sorry.

394
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
I'm sorry.

395
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I don't know where to go.

398
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I'll sit here and drink if I don't go in.

399
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
It's not a bad idea.

400
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm not good at it.

401
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Who doesn't care about

402
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,200
the great Lan Er?

403
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
It's a pity.

404
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
What is a pity?

405
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
It's a pity that they don't know

406
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,200
that their own mother is a cold and ruthless person

407
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
who doesn't know how to love and treat.

408
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
It's okay.

409
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
After I go back to Yun Meng,

410
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
I will definitely...

411
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I will definitely...

412
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Let's go.

413
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Uncle.

414
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
This person died of a stroke of Qi Yi.

415
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I've never seen this before.

416
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
It seems that

417
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
he was hit by something.

418
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
I don't know.

419
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I don't know.

420
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
I don't know.

421
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
I don't know.

422
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
I don't know.

423
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't know.

424
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I don't know.

425
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I don't know.

426
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
How do you want to choose a way?

427
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Did you forget

428
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
if you took this series with you to walk alone?

429
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Recently,

430
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,700
all the colleagues of the modern city

431
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,200
have come to pick it up.

432
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
However, there is some rest in the city.

433
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I forgot to check the mountain.

434
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,600
He, the facing Ra clan before

435
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,960
Xiyan Shun.

436
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,360
Shufu.

437
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,880
Who's making the noise?

438
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,480
The elder brother.

439
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,200
Childe Wei.

440
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,520
The Cloud Recesses

441
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
are not as good as lotus plants.

442
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
There are many rules.

443
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,360
You can't get out of the tunnel

444
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,560
without knowing the rules.

445
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,800
But you can't

446
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,520
break the rules of the Cloud Recesses.

447
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,840
You still have to

448
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,280
punish it.

449
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,640
How can you punish it?

450
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Wang Ji, look.

451
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,000
Three times the rules.

452
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
Ouch.

453
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,160
Wang Ji,

454
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,520
you talk about the feeling of Talk

455
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,040
Elite Wang's Filter Red.

456
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,360
Talking harshly seems the sort of thing

457
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,560
that you actually struggle resist.

458
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,520
Wang Ji,

459
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,000
you tried to planeta a little differently.

460
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,680
How dare you loud and clear

461
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,640
the words of everyone else.

462
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
I can't.

463
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,560
About

464
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:34,640
After tonight, we went to Da Yun's house.

465
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,600
Then we found out that we forgot to bring the iron.

466
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
But Li Shuwen can't blame us.

467
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,640
If we want to blame him, we can only blame Jin Zi.

468
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Anyway, we just arrived at the mountain gate.

469
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,280
But we can't enter.

470
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,400
There's no way.

471
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,840
I can only go to find the iron alone.

472
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
The emperor of Gusu is very famous.

473
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
I've never bought a glass of wine.

474
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Who knows that I haven't had a sip of it.

475
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I was broken by Lan Zhan.

476
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I haven't let him accompany me to the emperor's house.

477
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
He's good.

478
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
He even said something to me.

479
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Childe Wei, no matter what,

480
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,840
you also broke the rule of Lan family.

481
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,840
You can't blame Wang Ji for breaking your wine glass.

482
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Moreover, Miss Jiang and Childe Jiang

483
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,840
are also the Yuan Wei that Wang Ji told me about.

484
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Brother.

485
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
My senior sister came in.

486
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
She let you in?

487
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,840
It seems that you are not that impudent.

488
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Lan Zhan, aren't you?

489
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
Even if I apologize to you,

490
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
you can't do that.

491
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Okay, Childe Wei.

492
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Since you have misunderstood,

493
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
you can go back and rest.

494
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Zou Wu Jun, is he dead?

495
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Why are you so busy with the White cloth?

496
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
What did you say?

497
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Did I say something wrong?

498
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
But this afternoon,

499
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
when he was at the gate of the mountain,

500
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
he clearly wasn't dead.

501
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Did you understand what I said to you just now?

502
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Master, I understand.

503
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I will let the Wen Dynasty take you to the front.

504
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Take you to the Silver God Department.

505
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
But you have to rely on yourself

506
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
for the rest of the matter.

507
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
I will go to the front.

508
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
I will go to the front.

509
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
I will go to the front.

510
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
I will go to the front.

511
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I will go to the front.

512
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,840
But you have to rely on yourself for the rest of the matter.

513
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Remember,

514
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
the silver cloth and the white cloth

515
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
are the same.

516
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
You won't forget it, right?

517
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Find it out and bring it back.

518
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Fairy, I...

519
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Tell me.

520
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Ning is quite weak.

521
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Could you let her learn to fight with me?

522
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
You are afraid that she will be defeated in the night.

523
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
I dare not.

524
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Fine.

525
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Go with you.

526
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Wen Ning is very special.

527
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Maybe she can help you when you are investigating.

528
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Thank you, Fairy.

529
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Go to the front tomorrow.

530
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Yes.

531
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I will go to the front.

532
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I will go to the front tomorrow.

533
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
I will go to the front tomorrow.

534
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Look.

535
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,840
This person looks like a dead person.

536
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
It looks like a dead person too.

537
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,840
But it will still be affected by the power of the spirit.

538
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,840
He can't be considered a real dead person.

539
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Most of all...

540
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
What most of all?

541
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
I can't say it well.

542
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,840
But it looks like he lost his spirit.

543
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
He lost his spirit.

544
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
A dead person?

545
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Yes.

546
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
He looks like a dead person.

547
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,840
He looks like a dead person who can be controlled.

548
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Wang Qi.

549
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Brother.

550
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Wang Qi.

551
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Are you looking for me?

552
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
I am back.

553
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
You seem to be in a good mood.

554
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
I just talked to you.

555
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Although there are many reasons,

556
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I can make a decision.

557
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Someone should be involved.

558
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
I am not sure.

559
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Someone should know the truth.

560
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,840
If it is really like we expected,

561
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,840
then this person is not bad.

562
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,840
And the missing person may be just a beginning.

563
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
What's your plan?

564
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Now I can only visit him first.

565
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
But if...

566
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Brother.

567
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Forget it.

568
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
I might have thought too much.

569
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Wang Qi.

570
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,840
You should go and check the missing person.

571
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
But don't worry.

572
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Don't act rashly.

573
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Yes.

574
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Don't worry.

575
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
You never made me worry.

576
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Since father passed away,

577
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
you have been more mature and stable.

578
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Sometimes I wonder if I am too much of a burden to you.

579
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Brother is in a hurry.

580
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I just forgot to share the burden.

581
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,840
This time, you followed me to school.

582
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
There are many disciples and colleagues in the family.

583
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,840
You should have taught your friends more.

584
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,840
I think Mr. Wei is not bad.

585
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Although he is willing to do some good deeds,

586
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
but he is smart and clever.

587
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
His personality is also lively.

588
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Wang Qi.

589
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Is Mr. Wei a good man?

590
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
You are not different from each other.

591
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Xue Yang.

592
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Why are you laughing?

593
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Xie Du.

594
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
I am laughing.

595
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,840
These puppet are just a test.

596
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,840
I can't understand what they can do.

597
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
You are so stupid.

598
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
You are so stupid.

599
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
You are so stupid.

600
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
You are so stupid.

601
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
You are so stupid.

602
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
You are so stupid.

603
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
You are so stupid.

604
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
You are so stupid.

605
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
You are so stupid.

606
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Really?

607
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
If you don't believe me,

608
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
I believe the power of this silver iron.

609
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Why do you need so much effort

610
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
to catch so many people?

611
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
You are so stupid.

612
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Xue Yang.

613
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
You are so stupid.

614
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
You are so stupid.

615
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,700
You are a fool,

616
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
and you shouldn't be doing whatever.

617
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,940
Xun Yang,

618
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,940
You're easy on me.

619
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,020
Jealousy gives the world no interest inعت

620
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,960
In front of the everything

621
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,340
My�

622
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,320
Don't worry

623
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
When I collect the four-leafed iron,

624
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,320
I will make you do as you wish.

625
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Then, thank you, Xie Du.

626
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Xie Yang.

627
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:04,320
The last piece of iron hidden in the east of the West of the Great Fan is in the north of Yueyang.

628
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Xie Du, don't forget our promise.

629
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,320
When will you let me take the iron from the west of Yueyang?

630
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
I will tell you the last piece.

631
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Xie Du, don't forget our promise.

632
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:19,320
The mountain is so long, the clouds are so bright.

633
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:26,320
The rain and the rain are all looking at the stars.

634
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,320
How can I wait for the dream to sing?

635
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:35,320
How can I forget the things in the red dust?

636
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:42,320
The snow is so cold, the water is so deep.

637
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,320
The clouds are so gentle, the rain is so strong.

638
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,320
The flowers are so beautiful.

639
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,320
I wish I could be a young man like you.

640
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,320
How can I wait for the dream to sing?

641
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,320
How can I wait for the wind and waves?

642
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,320
The wind and waves are so beautiful.

643
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:18,320
The mountains are so beautiful, the water is so deep.

644
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,320
The clouds are so gentle, the rain is so strong.

645
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,320
The mountains are so gentle, the rain is so strong.

646
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:35,340
So the共 és soon.
