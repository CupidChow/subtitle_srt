1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,850
Episode 21

3
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,040
Come.

4
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,030
Sit down.

5
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,390
Xian,

6
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,750
you got thin.

7
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
Senior sister,

8
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,160
you too.

9
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,320
Where

10
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,440
have you been for the while?

11
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,190
Senior sister.

12
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,550
Wherever faraway I've been to

13
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,910
I won't leave now.

14
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,240
I promised that you, Jiang Cheng, and me

15
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,190
will be together forever.

16
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,080
Yes.

17
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,320
Together forever.

18
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,440
Don't you ever suddenly disappear again, OK?

19
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,470
Never again.

20
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,880
Bro Wei. Bro Wei.

21
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,000
Bro Wei.

22
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,270
Bro Wei.

23
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Bro Wei.

24
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,830
I heard you came back.

25
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,830
It's really you!

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,160
You're really...

27
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,350
Bro Nie,

28
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,720
long time no see.

29
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,390
Bro Wei,

30
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,110
you've been missing for months.

31
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,390
Everyone was desperately finding you.

32
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,070
Especially Second Childe Lan and Bro Jiang.

33
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,480
They almost...

34
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,270
That's enough.

35
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,390
You've talked too much

36
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,070
- Get out. - Wait!

37
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,790
I haven't finished yet.

38
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,550
Let's get out of here.

39
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,670
Tell you what.

40
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm giving a banquet tonight.

41
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,350
Everyone can come have fun.

42
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,720
Xian, I'll go prepare food.

43
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,070
You just take a rest.

44
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,270
You barely came back.

45
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,920
Don't exhaust yourself.

46
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,390
Clan... Clan Leader.

47
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,510
Second Childe... He...

48
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,230
Off you go.

49
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,390
Clan... Clan Leader.

50
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
I deeply regret your loss...

51
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,550
Get lost.

52
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,230
Get lost, all of you.

53
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,830
Sunshot, Sunshot.

54
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,040
I just wonder

55
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,480
how can you shoot sun in the sky down.

56
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,600
Clan Leader Jiang.

57
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,830
Childe Wei could have made it back safe and sound.

58
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,070
It's really a fortune to us rebellion against Wen.

59
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,270
Everyone.

60
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,390
Let's toast to Childe Wei.

61
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,640
-To Bro Wei. - To Bro Wei.

62
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,600
To Childe Wei.

63
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,350
Wei Wuxian.

64
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,920
Pardon me.

65
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Bro Wei shows his respect.

66
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,390
I'll dry the glass then.

67
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,230
- Dry it!  - Dry it!

68
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Childe Wei,

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
why don't carry your sword today?

70
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Just not in that mood.

71
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,920
As a disciple of cultivation clan,

72
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,720
carrying swords ought to be a kind of honor.

73
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,600
I knew Childe Wei's fame of untamed character.

74
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,670
But isn't it a bit excessive

75
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,640
to be so impertinent?

76
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,070
Childe Wei's renown in sword arts is well-known.

77
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,920
I expected to have a friendly match

78
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,000
in such rare case.

79
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,230
However you didn't take your sword.

80
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
How regrettable you can't do me such favor.

81
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,270
Bro Wei. Hey, Bro Wei.

82
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,320
Why don't tell everyone

83
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,960
how you killed Wen Chao?

84
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,710
An evil person naturally met his evil ending.

85
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,030
What...

86
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,710
What does he mean by that?

87
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,280
I heard Wen Chao suffered so much

88
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,400
before he died

89
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,790
that he might not be recognizable to his own father.

90
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,470
Yeah. And I also heard

91
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,840
that Childe Wei learned some strange sorceries.

92
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,590
His talismans even reveal some kind of viciousness.

93
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,520
Maybe he learned some lousy tricks.

94
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,910
Xian.

95
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,910
Where is Second Childe Lan?

96
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Don't know.

97
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,230
Haven't you two been getting along well?

98
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,150
Is it so?

99
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,590
Gentlemen,

100
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,230
now we are a coalition of four clans.

101
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,840
We'll eradicate Wen clan sooner or later.

102
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,550
We'll reduce them to nothing!

103
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,640
- Yeah! - That's right!

104
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,150
- Let's drink! - Down with Wen clan!

105
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,910
- Come on, bottoms up! - Down with Wen clan!

106
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,440
- Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

107
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,030
This is...

108
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,760
There will be a price of learning wicked tricks.

109
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,080
No exception throughout history.

110
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,960
These tricks harm your body

111
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,760
and your temperament more.

112
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
Why left early?

113
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
Aren't you the same?

114
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,150
I'm worrying about you.

115
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,030
Why do you look so gloomy?

116
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,710
How do you think?

117
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,150
Is it because of Lan Wangji?

118
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,470
Since that unhappy breakup,

119
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,080
he's been avoiding you.

120
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,280
Why do you come here to be disliked by him?

121
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Maybe I'm just bored.

122
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,760
Wei Wuxian.

123
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,280
I've found you your sword Whatever.

124
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,280
Why don't carry it?

125
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,350
I said not in mood.

126
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,080
You shall carry your sword in such public situation next time.

127
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,400
Or you'll present yourself as an example of no courtesy.

128
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,200
Come. Let's go back.

129
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,200
Jiang Cheng.

130
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,350
You should know me.

131
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,760
The more you want me to do something,

132
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,150
the more I don't want to.

133
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,230
What can they do if I don't carry my sword?

134
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,320
Besides,

135
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,640
I don't want to have a match

136
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,320
with somebody I don't know.

137
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,110
My sword can't return to sheath without some blood on it.

138
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,280
In case anyone would bother me with that again,

139
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,150
I decided not to carry to solve such problem for good.

140
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,080
Didn't you like to show off your sword arts?

141
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,760
I was a child then.

142
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,840
I can't be a child for my life.

143
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,710
Xian,

144
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,710
I saw the door open so I...

145
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,840
Xian, what happened?

146
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,150
Senior sister, it's OK.

147
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,670
This flute...

148
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,280
I never saw you holding that before.

149
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,880
Senior sister.

150
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,710
Senior sister, are you OK?

151
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,350
Did it hurt you?

152
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm fine.

153
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,470
So it recognize you as its owner?

154
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,350
I happened to pick it up.

155
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,110
It's your first-class spiritual tool then.

156
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,550
Just like mom's Purple Lightening.

157
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,000
Xian,

158
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,320
what's its name?

159
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Haven't figured it out.

160
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,470
It's first-class.

161
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
It deserves a name.

162
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
Don't you slight it.

163
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,400
Are you planning to call it Whatever

164
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,640
just like your sword?

165
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,200
Well...

166
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,760
I want to call it Chenqing.

167
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,840
Chenqing?

168
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,960
Chenqing.

169
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,880
Master.

170
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,440
There are some things that are not suitable for liberation,

171
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,000
so why not find a way to make use of them?

172
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,590
When Yu the Great tamed the flood,

173
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,670
obstruction was the inferior method,
and redirection was the superior.

174
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,760
Suppression is the same as obstruction,

175
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,000
so isn't it inferior?

176
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,110
Master.

177
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,880
Spiritual energy is energy.
Resentful energy is energy as well.

178
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,110
Spiritual energy is in our Pubes.

179
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,920
It can split mountains and fill oceans,
available for human use.

180
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
Same as resentful energy.

181
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,470
Then why can't it also be used by humans?

182
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
Xian,

183
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,110
I saw you didn't eat much at the banquet.

184
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
Have some soup.

185
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,760
Senior sister,

186
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,230
what is it?

187
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,070
Xian,

188
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,760
you've changed.

189
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
During the past three months,

190
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,280
where exactly have you been?

191
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,430
Senior sister,

192
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,070
you worry too much.

193
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,070
Xianxian,

194
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,070
I've watched you grow up.

195
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,400
You can hardly hide it in front of me.

196
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,520
But

197
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,430
your safe return is what matters.

198
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,430
It's the most important that we three are together.

199
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,160
As for other things,

200
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,520
you can tell me when you want to.

201
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,040
Deal?

202
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, well.

203
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,800
Let's pass that topic.

204
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
You've just returned.

205
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,680
Some sound sleep is necessary.

206
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,350
I...

207
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,070
I'll deliver some soup to Cheng.

208
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,640
It's partial of you, senior sister.

209
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,520
You leave Cheng so much soup.

210
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,760
Senior sister.

211
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,190
It tastes fantastic.

212
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
Xianxian, you're really back.

213
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,350
So comforting.

214
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,920
Sis,

215
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,190
have you seen Wei Wuxian?

216
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,590
No.

217
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,560
What's wrong?

218
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,110
Isn't he in his room?

219
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,560
Zewu Jun arrived today.

220
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Everyone is required to attend the meeting by Red Blade Master.

221
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,760
Now almost everyone is present,

222
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,710
but him.

223
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,710
Such Wei Wuxian...

224
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,000
Started his show the second he returned.

225
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
There, there.

226
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,160
You are a clan leader now.

227
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,230
Don't act so flustered.

228
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,430
Now, you just attend the meeting.

229
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,160
I'll take some people to find him.

230
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,560
He just got back after all.

231
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,400
Don't push it too hard on him.

232
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,680
Maybe he just went out for a walk.

233
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,590
At such moment,

234
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,070
no time is left for him to go for a walk.

235
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,680
Here is not home.

236
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,190
Isn't he embarrassing himself?

237
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,640
You're spoiling him again, sister.

238
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,230
Alright, just go to the meeting.

239
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,430
Go now.

240
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,830
I go find him.

241
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,520
Even though we are not holding an official conference here.

242
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,430
Isn't this Wei Wuxian

243
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,640
a little overweening?

244
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,280
We waited for him so long

245
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,110
on account of his slaying Wen Chao.

246
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,710
Red Blade Master,

247
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,160
he slew Wen Chao,

248
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,830
but you also slew Wen Xu.

249
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,040
Meritorious as he is,

250
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,800
he still has no right to let us

251
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,470
wait for him.

252
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,160
Gentlemen,

253
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,000
Wen Wuxian newly arrived at Qinghe.

254
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,230
And he just survived a severe wound.

255
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,470
Severe wound?

256
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,430
I could hardly see some severe wound in him.

257
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,520
Clan Leader Jiang.

258
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,070
You're the host of Jiang clan now.

259
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,520
Wei Ying is accordingly counted as your subordinate.

260
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,640
You ordered him to attend the meeting.

261
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,560
There should be no reason for him not to come.

262
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,160
I just wonder if he is doing something

263
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,040
without your acknowledge again.

264
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
It can't be that

265
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,430
he is gone practicing

266
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,400
those crooked tricks again, right?

267
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,710
This is domestic affair.

268
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,400
None of your Jin clan's business.

269
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,830
Enough.

270
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,950
Let's stop discussing such matter.

271
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,160
Now that Wen Ruohan lost his two sons,

272
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,520
he is like a man without both arms.

273
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,040
So it's our best chance to

274
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,920
stick together and conquer the Qishan.

275
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,160
Win or loss is on this battle.

276
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,230
We shall make concerted effort.

277
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,000
Red Blade Master is right.

278
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,520
Clan Leader Jiang,

279
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,430
if Childe Wei can't make it here today,

280
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,110
please relay to him

281
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,000
our discussion today.

282
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,590
That's enough.

283
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,190
Let's resume our conference.

284
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,350
Move! Catch up!

285
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,470
Hurry up!

286
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,680
Hurry up!

287
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,470
Move! Move!

288
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,280
Catch up! Be quick!

289
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,350
Don't linger!

290
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,560
Hurry! Move!

291
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,070
You! Obey us!

292
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,880
Catch up!

293
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,310
Move!

294
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,950
Go! Quickly!

295
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,000
Hurry up!

296
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,190
Move! Quickly! Move!

297
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,680
Move!

298
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm talking about you! Move it!

299
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,070
Move!

300
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
Hurry up! Catch up!

301
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,310
Hurry up! Hurry up!

302
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,470
Hurry up!

303
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,920
What are you waiting for? Catch up!

304
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,920
Move! Be obedient y'all!

305
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,470
Stop! Stop! Be obedient!

306
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,680
What are you doing? Stop!

307
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,830
Stop right there! Trying to run?

308
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,160
Be obedient, got it?

309
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,470
Qing.

310
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,590
Madam, don't be afraid.

311
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,190
We just need to follow.

312
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,230
Who else want to run away?

313
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,920
This is what waiting for you!

314
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,470
Qing,

315
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,880
where are they taking us?

316
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,350
No idea.

317
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,190
Maybe the Wens' slave camp.

318
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,280
I wonder if Ning is also there.

319
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
Retributive!

320
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,800
If Clan Leader Wen hadn't released the Dancing Peri,

321
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,710
today you would not...

322
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,560
you and Ning would not be incriminated

323
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,160
- by Wen clan. - Madam.

324
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,110
Madam. It's alright.

325
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,710
As long as Ning is safe.

326
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,280
Move!

327
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,430
Hurry up! Move!

328
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,160
Hurry up! Forwards!

329
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,070
Hurry up! Catch up!

330
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,160
Get up!

331
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,400
Move!

332
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,920
Move!

333
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,920
Madam! Madam!

334
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,640
Are you OK, madam?

335
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,280
Hurry up!

336
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,920
Get up now!

337
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,760
Get up! Get up you all!

338
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,070
Get up you people!

339
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,160
What...

340
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,310
What was it just now?

341
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,950
Here is haunted! Haunted!

342
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,560
What haunted?! Move!

343
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,560
Move! Hurry! Get moving!

344
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,800
You catch up! Move!

345
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,350
Move! Obey!

346
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,680
Keep it up! Hurry up!

347
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,070
Hurry up!

348
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,560
I said you! Hurry up!

349
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,430
Move! Keep it up! Now!

350
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,950
Move!

351
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,710
Move!

352
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,430
Xian.

353
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,190
Xian, what's the matter?

354
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,470
Nothing.

355
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,000
Senior sister, why are you here?

356
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
On Zewu Jun's arrival,

357
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,880
Red Blade Master is calling everybody to a meeting.

358
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,000
Cheng was looking for you everywhere.

359
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,470
Xian.

360
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,680
What...

361
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,070
What happened just now?

362
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
It was...

363
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,710
It was the strong wind.

364
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,760
It broke several branches.

365
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,280
Really?

366
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,830
Since it's nothing,

367
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,710
let's go back now.

368
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,430
Xian, what is it?

369
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,110
I'm fine.

370
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,920
Let's go, senior sister.

371
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
As you people just stated,

372
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,350
Wen Ruohan lost his sons.

373
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,560
There is no one capable of leading troops to flank us.

374
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,470
Only the army in Qishan remains.

375
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,070
We can lead our troops straightly to

376
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,110
the Wens' den and devastate it for good.

377
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,400
Be that as it may,

378
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,230
I hope everyone keep your guards on.

379
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,400
Wen Ruohan's sons

380
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
are not his ace.

381
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,880
It's the Yin Iron and his puppets.

382
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,800
Zewu Jun is right.

383
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,880
Wen Ruohan was able to slaughter various cultivation clans

384
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,880
just because of his control over Yin Iron.

385
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,470
He can manipulate other people.

386
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,190
Turn people into puppets against us.

387
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,310
This is exactly

388
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,640
what we shall deliberate over today.

389
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,680
How to cope with

390
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,520
the Yin Iron in Wen Ruohan's hands.

391
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,760
Bro Wei.

392
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,430
Wei Wuxian.

393
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,000
Clan Leader Nie.

394
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,880
Wen Ruohan's Yin Iron might be outside our concern.

395
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,800
What do you mean?

396
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,830
Maybe there is some countermeasure against Yin Iron.

397
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,280
Childe Wei, please elaborate it.

398
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,190
Zewu Jun,

399
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,800
I don't mean to conceal it.

400
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,310
We'll see in a month about.

401
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,110
Childe Wei,

402
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,350
why do you stop carrying sword?

403
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,360
Just n ot in mood.

404
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,800
Such Wei Wuxian...

405
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,560
Is he intending to fool us?

406
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,950
How can there be something countering Yin Iron?

407
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,470
It counters itself?

408
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,950
Wangji.

409
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,950
why is Childe Wei so confident

410
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,670
that we can acquire the Yin Iron

411
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,870
against Wen Ruohan in a month about?

412
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,000
Don't know.

413
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,630
So many predecessors

414
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,520
had failed for Yin Iron.

415
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm afraid Childe Wei is overconfident.

416
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,800
Wangji,

417
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,670
I'd like to ask you something.

418
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,360
Was the death of people in Yiling Supervisory Office

419
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,000
really related to Yin Iron?

420
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,470
No.

421
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,710
Brother.

422
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,230
Not his style.

423
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,840
But what happened there

424
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,360
is weird indeed.

425
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,630
When you approached Yiling,

426
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,320
anything unusual spotted?

427
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,520
Brother.

428
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,430
Are there rules

429
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,390
already set for everything in the world?

430
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,280
I thought

431
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,080
with my lifetime

432
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,520
finishing reading what Lan clan store

433
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,150
means discerning the rules of everything in the world.

434
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,870
But I found out

435
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,150
even if I finished all existing books,

436
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
there are still so many puzzles

437
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,800
in the world.

438
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,560
There are no set rules.

439
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,320
There wasn't a clear line between right and wrong.

440
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,840
If people can't be judged simply in this way,

441
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,910
then how can we evaluate a person?

442
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,710
What makes us human

443
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,070
can't be judged simply as right or wrong,

444
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,470
but lies in himself.

445
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,470
As we evaluate others,

446
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,600
we shall not label them as black or white,

447
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,470
but know their deep intention inside.

448
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,950
Wangji.

449
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,630
If you worry about Childe Wei...

450
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,360
Not a bit.

451
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,710
Be frank with me.

452
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,040
What do you mean?

453
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,910
You and Lan Wangji

454
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,600
decide to cut association just like that?

455
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,470
It's him who cut the association.

456
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,910
I didn't.

457
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,870
He didn't like to respond to you anyway.

458
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,670
Jiang Cheng,

459
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,630
I remember you did not like him.

460
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,760
Why are you speaking for him now?

461
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,950
Nonsense.

462
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,760
We are on the same side now.

463
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,630
Four major clans stick together.

464
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,320
There is no need  to fuss

465
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,670
about such trivial thing.

466
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,800
Besides, back in Yiling it was...

467
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,390
Anyway you should not talk

468
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,630
those nonsense again.

469
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,950
Sword arts is decent technique and should not be abandoned.

470
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,150
What's the matter?

471
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,950
Now

472
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,670
you really act like a clan leader.

473
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Second Childe Lan.

474
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,630
Lady Jiang.

475
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,150
Come for Xian?

476
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,670
Second Childe Lan.

477
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,800
I need to ask you

478
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,910
about something.

479
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,630
This method harms your body,

480
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,000
and distort your temperament.

481
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,760
What...

482
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,080
What should be done then?

483
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,800
Sword arts is the most decent technique.

484
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,040
Talismans and spells can only assist it.

485
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,190
They can't be used as a cultivation method.

486
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,670
Lan Zhan,

487
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,040
what were you telling my senior sister?

488
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,950
Wei Ying.

489
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,280
I remember I said

490
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,320
you should stay out of the Jiangs' business.

491
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,600
Xian,

492
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,150
Second Childe Lan was just...

493
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,840
What happened, Xian?

494
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,120
I was worried about you, so I asked Second Childe Lan.

495
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,430
Why are you so mad?

496
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,230
Senior sister,

497
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,320
has he...

498
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,760
told you

499
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,120
about Yiling Supervisory Office?

500
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,600
He said nothing.

501
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,670
Lan Zhan.

502
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
Lan Zhan, listen to me.

503
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,120
Lan Zhan, not seen for several months

504
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,000
you've made progress again!

505
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,430
It's you didn't make progress.

506
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,840
Where is Whatever?
