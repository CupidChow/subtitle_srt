1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,083
Drum roll, please. Ta-da!

2
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,791
The Amur adonis buds
have finally sprouted.

3
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:39,125
Today marks a major milestone as life
returns to the surface of this red planet.

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,666
Well, it's not exactly on the surface.

5
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,833
Breaking news.

6
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,291
With preparations underway

7
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,041
to select astronauts
for the Fourth Mars Expedition,

8
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,125
NASA has shared
some dramatic news from Mars.

9
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,666
Twenty-five years ago,
a quake on Mars caused the collapse

10
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,250
of an underground,
manned research facility.

11
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:03,375
The second Mars mission
failed to bring the crew home.

12
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,375
This not only devastated
the families of those lost,

13
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:10,500
but also people around the world
who had prayed for their safe return.

14
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,833
The belongings of the late Son Ji-young,

15
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,541
the first Korean astronaut
to be selected for a Mars expedition,

16
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,208
were among the artifacts recovered.

17
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,333
Seoul Station Square,
and its surrounding area,

18
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,416
is a low-altitude drone flight zone.

19
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,083
Air taxi drivers are advised
to be cautious of drone collisions…

20
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,666
You scared me!

21
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,000
-How are you?
-How am I?

22
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,916
My dreams have been crushed, so…

23
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,583
Let me see your face.

24
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,875
Turn on your video.

25
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,791
Here you go,
a face full of crushed dreams.

26
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,666
Wow, is this a junkyard or your home?

27
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,541
When did you get time to collect all this?

28
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,708
It's all my parents' stuff.
I need to clear it out when I get time.

29
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,041
Oh, come on!

30
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,041
-Don't go through me.
-Scanning.

31
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,083
-Stop messing around.
-Target. Managing mode.

32
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,250
Get out of here.

33
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,333
Hey!

34
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,041
Scanning target.

35
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,291
LOST IN STARLIGHT

36
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,458
MARS EXPEDITION TEAM'S BELONGINGS
RECOVERED AFTER 25 YEARS

37
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:51,708
MODERN ELECTRONICS REPAIRS

38
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

39
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,250
Are you hurt?

40
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,958
Hey, what's taking you so long?

41
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,958
My goodness. I told you.

42
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,250
Oh, come on.

43
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,750
I'm fine. You can go.

44
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,750
Wait…

45
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,583
This…

46
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,208
Is this the Crozley All-in-One 2023 model?

47
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,916
I could fix it for you.

48
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,916
Here's my card. Please stop by.

49
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,625
-I'll fix it for you.
-Keep going.

50
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,541
I'm sorry!

51
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,166
Hey…

52
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,250
All right. This one goes to room 402.

53
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,625
-Okay, and that one?
-The drone will take it. See you later.

54
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll head up, then.

55
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,958
Soo-jung's favorite random game!

56
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,625
Which game? Game…

57
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,125
I just put it here. Where did it go?

58
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,625
I swear, I left it right… Here it is!

59
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,166
Good grief. What a day.

60
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,291
Let's see.

61
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,333
I brought this in a month ago,
and you're just looking at it now?

62
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,250
-Jay said he took care of everything.
-Come on.

63
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,791
What would you do without Jay?

64
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,500
-You wouldn't have anyone to blame.
-Shush, I can't focus.

65
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,125
Excuse me.

66
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,958
Is there a young man who works here?

67
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,083
-A young man?
-Yes.

68
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,958
Oh, you mean Jay.

69
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,416
Hey, Jay.

70
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,750
-You're here.
-Well, look at you.

71
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,666
-Who's this?
-Your girlfriend?

72
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,541
-Gosh.
-Come on, ma'am.

73
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,125
She's just a customer.

74
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,500
-My goodness.
-Oh, to be young again…

75
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,500
-Cut it out.
-Must be nice being young.

76
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,958
-Shall I load them into the car?
-I'll do it. You help the customer.

77
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,416
-Sure.
-Good work, Jay.

78
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,833
Please come again, Ms. Oh.

79
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,291
Come this way.

80
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
-This way.
-Okay.

81
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,333
Glad you managed to find your way here.

82
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,541
Sorry for rushing off earlier.

83
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,875
-Come on up.
-Okay.

84
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,166
SEWOON PLAZA

85
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,875
The circuit board is completely destroyed.

86
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,500
Yes, thanks to you.

87
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,958
It was probably broken before it fell.

88
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,125
Anyway, can you fix it?

89
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,083
I'll start looking for the parts.

90
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,041
It might be retro,
but it was affordable then.

91
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,291
Finding the parts shouldn't be too hard.

92
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,000
Write your details down.

93
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,250
Then I can contact you when it's ready.

94
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,875
Let me.

95
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,750
Like this.

96
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,125
JOO NAN-YOUNG

97
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,458
Your name, on paper?

98
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,291
Wow. You don't find guys
like that anymore.

99
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,833
Great. Now that he's got your number,
why not date him and clear your head?

100
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,958
Drop it.

101
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,708
How's everything at the lab?
And the leadership meetings?

102
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,791
Your psychological evaluation scores
barely made the cut.

103
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,708
Things could change
if you make a real breakthrough.

104
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,916
A real breakthrough?

105
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,666
I hear the detector has noise issues.

106
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,833
If you fix it, maybe you can come back.

107
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,041
Do we need to boost it from 270 to 300?

108
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,875
Looks like the team
has been struggling without you.

109
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,291
Fine.

110
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,291
I should be ready at all times.

111
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,166
You never know
when a miracle might strike.

112
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,958
DR. JOO DEMOTED TO BACKUP FOR MARS

113
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,250
Call if you get anything
in this condition.

114
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,625
-Okay.
-All right. I'll get going.

115
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,208
-Take care.
-So boring…

116
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,375
-I'm sitting farthest from the teacher.
-Hey, you said you practiced a lot!

117
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,750
Have you given up music for good?

118
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,083
At this rate, you'll end up like me.

119
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,458
I'd be living the dream
if I ended up like you.

120
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,250
Jeez, you're crazy.

121
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,416
DR. JOO NAN-YOUNG

122
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,458
I didn't know she was famous.

123
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,958
What are you staring at?

124
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,625
She's cool.

125
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,416
Do we have the noise test results?

126
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,166
I'm heading out now.

127
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,958
Look. It's working. This is great!

128
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,333
-Oh!
-Oh no!

129
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,833
This is Nan-young.
I'm reporting on my progress.

130
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,833
I've been upgrading the Life Form Detector
since coming home.

131
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
The research is going smoothly.

132
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,458
If we achieve 300 resolution
prior to launch,

133
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,916
please consider allowing me to join
the Mars expedition to manage the system.

134
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,583
Good news.

135
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,833
I found a way. Are you free tomorrow?

136
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,083
Oh man…

137
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,125
I guess this doesn't fit.
Sorry you came all this way for nothing.

138
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,208
Not at all. Thanks for trying.

139
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,291
Give it to me already.

140
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,500
I don't want to bother you anymore,
and it's not even that important.

141
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,666
-It's not mine anyway!
-Come on.

142
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,291
It's written right here in big letters.

143
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,916
"Nan-young's."

144
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,833
Is it really not yours?

145
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,625
It isn't.

146
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,750
It was my mom's.

147
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,250
Then,

148
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,125
we definitely need to fix it.

149
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,541
Hey, sir, I appreciate the effort.

150
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,291
It's more than enough.

151
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,375
It's Jay, not "sir."

152
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,291
What?

153
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,791
My name.

154
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,333
It's Jay.

155
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,541
All right, Mr. Jay.

156
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,000
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Right?

157
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,875
I did work pretty hard.

158
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,875
On that note, aren't you hungry?

159
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,916
Wow.

160
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,000
Why doesn't it taste this good
when I make it?

161
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,416
Food tastes best
when someone else cooks it.

162
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
You think so?

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,750
Maybe good company makes it taste better.

164
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,666
When did we start being so forward?

165
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,000
I was talking to myself.

166
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,750
No disrespect.

167
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,666
This is on me.

168
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,416
-As you said, you worked hard, sir.
-Come on.

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,250
Enough with the "sir." It's Jay.

170
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,750
Let's be on a first name basis.

171
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,333
We'll see each other
at least three more times.

172
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,041
Agreed?

173
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,750
Then…

174
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,625
Do it on the third occasion.

175
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,625
Call me.

176
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,208
Oh my gosh. It's so cold.

177
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,458
Nan-young.

178
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,083
Well…

179
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,500
The thing is…

180
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,666
This is our third time
seeing each other, right?

181
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,166
Can I…

182
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,833
call you by your name now?

183
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,458
What?

184
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,791
I'm so out of breath.

185
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
-Let's go.
-Here.

186
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,833
-How'd you know I didn't have an umbrella?
-I noticed earlier.

187
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,750
So I ran as fast as I could.

188
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,291
This model was released right after yours,

189
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,041
but the specs and design
are almost identical.

190
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,125
This really wasn't easy to find.

191
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,833
Luckily, I happened to know someone,
so I got it for next to nothing.

192
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,708
It looks the same at first glance.

193
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,208
Would that be okay?

194
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,458
-Does it play music?
-Of course!

195
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,500
Want to hear it?

196
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,291
Hold on.

197
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,916
You're using a rare record player
as a Bluetooth speaker?

198
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,625
-How modern of you.
-Shush.

199
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,458
I love this song.

200
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,333
I found it on the cloud a few years ago.

201
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,541
It sounds like a demo. It's unfinished.

202
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,583
I used to play this song so much
while I studied

203
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,708
that my roommate ended up moving out.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Isn't that funny?

205
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,333
-That's a nice surprise.
-What?

206
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,041
Do you know this song?

207
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,166
That's amazing!

208
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,208
I've never met anyone who knew it.

209
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,125
Yeah, that really is… amazing.

210
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,291
I deleted it right away.

211
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,583
I never imagined
anyone would listen to it.

212
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
What?

213
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,541
Is this your song?

214
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,875
Did you sing it?

215
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,250
You're lying.

216
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,291
-Jay doesn't lie.
-Oh my…

217
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,583
Come on.

218
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,625
We don't have any customers,
and the part-timer's slacking off.

219
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,625
-What are you…
-Why is this here?

220
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,625
Oh, my guitar!

221
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,291
Excuse me.

222
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,666
Why did he take a nap here again?

223
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,916
To be honest,

224
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,750
I still haven't finished it.

225
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,666
Is that okay?

226
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:49,958
Yes.

227
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,916
I lose myself to fun

228
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:17,458
In nameless cities
Drifting to the unknown

229
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,000
Sleeping somewhere in between

230
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:33,041
For someone like me
Life is sometimes just hard to foresee

231
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Holding my breath
I'll step through concrete mountains

232
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:47,833
I'll overcome it all
And wipe the dust off my face

233
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,416
Are you telling me
the song really is yours?

234
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,458
Are you a solo artist?
Or are you in a band? Do you perform live?

235
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,458
-You have lots of questions.
-I've been dying to know.

236
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,458
I couldn't find anything about you.
No albums, no socials.

237
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:10,083
But the song is just amazing. I mean…

238
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,541
I'm honored.

239
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,000
"Honored"?

240
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,791
SPACE EXPLORATION

241
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,125
DR. JOO'S DREAM TO BLOOM FLOWERS ON MARS

242
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,125
MARS EXPEDITION INTERVIEW
AIRS AT THIS TIME TOMORROW

243
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,458
Let's see.

244
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,833
The potassium and phosphate levels…

245
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,791
Oh no. How can they be this high?

246
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,916
How did everyone allow it to get this bad?

247
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,833
Jeez…

248
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,375
Let me think…

249
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,750
Where did all the seedlings
from the germination room go?

250
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Dad, it's me.

251
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,500
So this is…

252
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,083
Yesterday, the Life Form Detector
that you've been developing

253
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,250
was unveiled on social media

254
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,458
by the Korea
National Aerospace Administration.

255
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,125
Do you think we'll meet real Martians
during this expedition?

256
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,250
Our main goal
is finding traces of microbes

257
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:20,583
or organic matter
released through respiration.

258
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,500
Wow, that's amazing, Dr. Joo.

259
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,083
With this detector,

260
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,125
we might even meet
microbial aliens on Mars.

261
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,666
Yes, perhaps.

262
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,416
I know this might be a sensitive topic…

263
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,125
The astronaut who passed away
during the Mars mission, Son Ji-young,

264
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,541
was your mother, Dr. Joo.

265
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,166
Our viewers might remember her.

266
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,958
What made you decide
to become an astronaut and go to Mars?

267
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,458
Yes, well…

268
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,791
Actually, I don't remember much
about my mother…

269
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,000
MOM'S ON MARS
MOM ISN'T ON MARS

270
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,000
-Dr. Joo?
-Ah… yes.

271
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,875
I apologize.

272
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,875
I know this might be a sensitive topic…

273
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:23,583
The astronaut who passed away
during the Mars mission, Son Ji-young,

274
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,875
was your mother, Dr. Joo.

275
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:29,083
Our viewers might remember her.

276
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:33,708
What made you decide
to become an astronaut and go to Mars?

277
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,250
RECORD PLAYER: IT'S RAINING…

278
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,916
LET'S GET SOME OF THIS

279
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,500
-I'm stuffed.
-Tell me about it.

280
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,708
When you're feeling down,
nothing hits the spot like good food.

281
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,666
Right? When you're feeling down…

282
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,666
You can always talk to me, you know?

283
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,250
-What?
-Or not.

284
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,625
Then can I just ask you something?

285
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,166
Sure.

286
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,166
Why did you first get into music?

287
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,250
Whoa, well…

288
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,375
No special reason.

289
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:35,375
I was mostly raised by my grandpa
in the countryside.

290
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:40,583
He used to take me to the public baths,
and he'd scrub me with his rough hands.

291
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,750
I guess that really upset me as a kid.

292
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:48,041
Whenever I went to the bathhouse,
I always cried for my mom.

293
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,250
Grandpa taught me how to sing
to keep me quiet.

294
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,166
He promised to buy me a Coke

295
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,500
if I sang without crying,

296
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,625
and I fell for it.

297
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,333
Little Jay must've been cute.

298
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,583
I had my moments.

299
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,500
Grown-up Jay's even better.
Quite handsome too.

300
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,791
Hilarious.

301
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,416
Stay here. I'll get some more.

302
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,166
I'll come too.
You might get kidnapped for being cute.

303
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,500
Come on now.

304
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,166
How's grown-up Jay doing?

305
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,791
Well,

306
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,500
I guess…

307
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,083
I'm waiting for the desire to sing
to find its way back to me.

308
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,791
There, it found you.

309
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,875
As a child, I used to stargaze
with my dad every night.

310
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,750
I always wondered what was up there.

311
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,125
He'd go on and on about Mars.

312
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,000
I was practically brainwashed.

313
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,041
Your dad turned you into a Mars geek.

314
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,958
You could say that.

315
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,541
I guess I wanted to be someone special.

316
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,250
An astronaut who goes to Mars,
representing mankind.

317
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,083
That's special.

318
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,333
-Nan-young.
-Yes?

319
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,041
You are special.

320
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,541
Whether you go to space or not.

321
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,875
-That's your thing, isn't it?
-What is?

322
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,833
All that sweet talk.

323
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,375
Just so you know, it's a lost cause.

324
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:43,375
Because I'll be flying off
into space someday.

325
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,250
You're not leaving…

326
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,791
right away, are you?

327
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,833
It's still a no.

328
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:00,041
Not a chance.
I can't make any commitments.

329
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,958
Get it together, Joo Nan-young.

330
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,708
Commitment?

331
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,250
-Don't get any closer.
-What?

332
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,125
-Let's keep our distance.
-Distance?

333
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:14,875
Yes.

334
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,333
Stay there!

335
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,500
-Hey, keep it down!
-Come on. Put this back on.

336
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,166
Is this your bedroom?

337
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,333
-Sorry about that!
-Sorry!

338
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,041
Let's go.

339
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,583
Gosh.

340
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:47,916
I'm exhausted.

341
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Are you okay? My goodness.

342
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Oh no.

343
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,125
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,000
So sorry.

345
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,250
Here, let me see.

346
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,166
This isn't good.

347
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,083
What isn't?

348
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,625
You've already done this much?

349
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,416
I'm almost there.
There's one thing I can't figure out.

350
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,750
Put layer AB first and add BC…

351
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,625
Gosh. Then it's too thick,
and there's not enough space.

352
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:21,333
I need to finish this before the launch
so someone can take it with them.

353
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,875
Right, Rosa?

354
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,000
Wait. Who's going to take it?

355
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,083
Me?

356
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,166
Joo Nan-young.

357
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,166
As they say in Korean,
you've got one thick natjjak.

358
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,875
-Where'd you learn that?
-You pick up Korean fast at the clubs.

359
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,583
Plus, dating a Korean
helps you really master the language.

360
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,250
Rosa.

361
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:45,041
-Too bad you can't date on Mars.
-How are things with that artist?

362
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,250
JAY

363
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:54,500
Hello? So you're Nan-young's boyfriend?
How much do you like her?

364
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:55,750
Cut it out, Rosa!

365
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:59,000
Hello? Hi, Jay.

366
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,958
Right now? Outside?

367
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:08,458
LET'S CELEBRATE! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MARS GEEK

368
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,791
Let me see…

369
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,291
What did I say?

370
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,875
My dad's a Mars geek.

371
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,541
Nice hideout.

372
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,791
This is like
the Earth Defense Force's secret base.

373
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,250
He's broadcasting to Mars right now.

374
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,833
He believes someone
with the same birthday as me is on Mars.

375
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,875
To your mother, perhaps?

376
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,666
-How did you know?
-Sorry.

377
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:57,208
If your girlfriend is famous, her birthday
and family history are all online.

378
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,375
Yeah, it's for Mom.

379
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,208
He's been doing this for over 20 years,

380
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,916
not accepting that Mom is gone.

381
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:11,208
This is how I celebrate my birthday
every year.

382
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,750
I'll join you from now on.

383
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,458
We just started broadcasting.

384
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:21,416
-It's a small setup but it works well.
-May I take a look?

385
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,708
Of course. Do you want to see more?

386
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,791
-My goodness.
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

387
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,208
You're better at breaking things
than fixing them.

388
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,166
Call yourself a "Destruction Expert."

389
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,041
My goodness.
It's badly damaged on this side.

390
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:43,375
I really hope
these signals can reach Mars.

391
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,791
Radio waves can go anywhere.
They just need someone to receive them.

392
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,125
Once we fix the base antenna,
we can make calls.

393
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,041
With a 20-minute delay, of course.

394
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,583
-Nan-young, the thing is…
-Yes?

395
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,166
If you actually go to Mars,

396
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,583
how will I contact you?

397
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,791
Should I go buy some walkie-talkies?

398
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:05,958
Walkie-talkies?

399
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:11,500
Right…

400
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,708
I wonder if I'll actually be able
to go to space.

401
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,875
Let's go right now.

402
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,416
To space.

403
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,375
Hey, look at this one.

404
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,708
-This one?
-It's so cute.

405
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,458
It's coming out.

406
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,458
-Wow, that looks delicious.
-Seriously.

407
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,291
-This is my first observatory visit.
-It's been a while.

408
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,083
-Which constellation is that?
-I'm not sure.

409
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,125
Jay, that's Mars.

410
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,541
-Where? Which one?
-There.

411
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,625
It's not that far.

412
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,458
I told you. It's really close.

413
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:02,166
-But it takes six months?
-In space, six months isn't that long.

414
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,041
Wow.

415
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,291
That's really close.

416
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:12,833
As it's so close,
you'll be back really soon.

417
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,666
Right, Mommy?

418
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,375
Lie!

419
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,750
It was a lie!

420
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,958
You said you'd be back soon.

421
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,375
But it was a lie!

422
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,291
Mom.

423
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,708
I miss you.

424
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,083
Let's call Mom.

425
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
I miss her.

426
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,583
Don't leave.

427
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,375
I love you too.

428
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,291
Mom.

429
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,541
Mom!

430
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,041
Liar.

431
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,750
Nan-young, do you want rice or toast--

432
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,083
What's wrong?

433
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,958
Why are you crying?

434
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,833
It's nothing.

435
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,333
A stupid dream.

436
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,458
After a nightmare…

437
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,916
let the sunshine work its magic.

438
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,833
What's this igloo?

439
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,458
So, you're into gardening?

440
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,833
This isn't just gardening.

441
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,333
-Scanning.
-Who's our little friend?

442
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:47,708
It's an ultra-high-density detector
that tracks microbes in real-time.

443
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:52,750
This masterpiece is the culmination
of my scientific knowledge.

444
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,791
I have no idea what that is,
but it sounds incredible.

445
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,750
That's because it is.

446
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,708
Yeah, it really is.

447
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,166
These are Amur adonis.

448
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,833
They're the first to bloom
in the snow each year.

449
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,375
These flowers naturally generate heat,
allowing them to bloom,

450
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,666
but these samples
have maximized their self-heating ability.

451
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,333
I'm going to plant a flower garden
on Mars with them.

452
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:23,250
These two will be the parents
who protect the little ones.

453
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,208
Docking now.

454
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:28,250
They must feel safe. The beam projector
and igloo are protecting them.

455
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,458
Managing mode.

456
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,000
Were you listening at all?

457
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:37,166
Dr. Joo, I have a lot more to learn.

458
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,625
Today's research topic

459
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,750
is Jay's self-heating ability
to protect Joo Nan-young!

460
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,000
Get away from me!

461
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,541
I guess I was about five.

462
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,666
I made a paper astronaut like this.

463
00:36:57,041 --> 00:37:00,166
Even then, you were all about space.

464
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:05,208
In the end,
it managed to reach space before me.

465
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,458
How?

466
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,583
Mom took it with her.

467
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,458
Since I couldn't go with her,
she took it instead of me.

468
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,458
With such innocence,

469
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:18,250
I spent ages collecting gum wrappers
to make the astronaut shiny.

470
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,541
That's amazing.

471
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,958
Do you remember all that
from your childhood?

472
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,833
Isn't it strange?

473
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,208
Sometimes I can't even picture Mom's face.

474
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,583
The gum wrappers

475
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,750
were C and D.

476
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,208
The scotch tape was B.

477
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,541
The popsicle stick was A.

478
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,125
Use A as the sole material!

479
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,666
What do you mean?

480
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,333
What's wrong?

481
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,791
Put layer A on its own,

482
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,125
then place B between C and D.

483
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,083
Eureka!

484
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,833
-Scanning.
-Some details still require fine-tuning.

485
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:11,916
Scanning target.

486
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,333
But the sensitivity and speed
are already perfect as they are.

487
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,000
Good job. It turned out great.

488
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:22,958
But why are there microbes
in the clean room?

489
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,458
Get the person in charge.

490
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,333
I'll have another of the same.

491
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,625
And you?

492
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,000
-Another Coke?
-Mm-hmm.

493
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,958
I just made a groundbreaking discovery.
Let me treat you!

494
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:40,750
A Coke is fine.

495
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,958
They must be performing.

496
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,750
That's nice.

497
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,333
Jay.

498
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,375
Hey.

499
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,166
Why are you ignoring my messages?

500
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,583
-We have no reason to keep in touch.
-Fine.

501
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,791
Keep running away, then.

502
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:48,000
Plenty of people
still want to hear your music.

503
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,208
My music?

504
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51,250
That wasn't my music, was it?

505
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,666
-You just want--
-This concert…

506
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,625
-Jay.
-Panda Sound is coming.

507
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,166
It's the label you always dreamed about.

508
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,333
-Sorry. Let's go.
-Okay.

509
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,500
Come to Rolling Burn at 8:00 on Saturday.

510
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:09,166
You should come too.
Jay is amazing when he performs.

511
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,500
She's an old bandmate.

512
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,541
We're not close anymore.

513
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,333
Sorry if that was awkward.

514
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,833
It's okay.

515
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,250
But I kind of want to see…

516
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,166
you on stage.

517
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,916
I looked you up but didn't find anything.

518
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,250
Is there a video or anything?

519
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,583
Choi Di-a!

520
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,833
-Diablo, look over here.
-Cut it out!

521
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,791
Stop! I'm gonna kill you!

522
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,458
What's wrong?

523
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:06,666
Don't you like it?

524
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,833
It felt a little flat.

525
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,791
I tweaked it
to better suit live performances.

526
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,833
You haven't changed at all.

527
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,583
Is this even my song?

528
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:20,958
And the chorus…

529
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,250
You can't sing it anyway.

530
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:28,125
And you won't release it.
Shouldn't someone sing it at least?

531
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:31,250
Forget it. I don't know why
I even bothered coming.

532
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,958
Good luck without a guitarist.

533
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,416
You begged me so much,
I thought you'd changed.

534
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,000
If you walk out now,

535
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,666
you'll be stuck like this forever.

536
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,416
Today is your last chance

537
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,000
to make up for your mistakes.

538
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:49,666
You're here.

539
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,541
That's what matters. Let's make it count.

540
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,083
Okay.

541
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,916
We're already at the last song.

542
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,458
You're beautiful!

543
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,708
We've got a returning member here.

544
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,458
-You remember him, right?
-Yes, we do!

545
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,500
Jay on guitar.

546
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,125
Who?

547
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,791
-Oh my!
-Yes, Jay!

548
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,500
On that note…

549
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,458
Here's a song
we've never performed as The Moles.

550
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,916
It's Jay's original song.

551
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,000
"Stay."

552
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,250
-Jay?
-You come in from here.

553
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,458
Isn't that rushed?

554
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,833
I'm feeling it.

555
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,625
-I'll send it to them as is.
-Okay.

556
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:57,250
-You changed the whole thing.
-The audience and label are waiting.

557
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,958
-Are you crazy?
-I can't sing it.

558
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,750
The show's starting. So what?!

559
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,125
I just can't do this!

560
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,583
No one cares about your little story.

561
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:07,583
TRASH
JUST A DIARY

562
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,083
He looks amazing! Jay!

563
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,750
Jay, aren't you going to sing anymore?

564
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:53,416
I don't know. Even if I join them,
Di-a is still the band's singer.

565
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:56,583
I'm still figuring out
if I want us to be a team.

566
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,041
Okay.

567
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,291
I don't really know much,

568
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,375
but that song…

569
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,750
I liked your version better.

570
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,916
Of course, you were amazing on guitar.

571
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,083
I really hope that one day,

572
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,875
everyone will get to hear your voice,
not just me.

573
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:20,041
-Can't it just be for you?
-No way.

574
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,125
I want to show you off to everyone.

575
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,625
I made it!

576
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,708
-What is it?
-It's a secret.

577
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:45,875
Tell me.

578
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,708
Oh my gosh. I'm so happy!

579
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,916
You said you'd never sell it,

580
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,333
yet here you are,
ruining a perfectly good one.

581
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:59,500
Is life treating you better now?

582
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,500
Yes, it's treating me pretty well.

583
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,791
Oh, please…

584
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,375
JAY

585
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:51,083
-Congratulations, Dr. Joo.
-Congratulations!

586
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Will the official announcement
air tomorrow, director?

587
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,333
-Yes, at 8 p.m.
-Come on over.

588
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:58,750
Be careful until then.

589
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:05,375
-Director, isn't it airing today?
-Oh, it's tonight.

590
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:06,958
-Dr. Joo.
-I'll treat you.

591
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,041
In two years' time?

592
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,291
-Who'll be here then?
-No, before I leave.

593
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:12,541
-Congratulations.
-Cheers!

594
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:25,416
My dear Nan-young must've been very busy.

595
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,208
The records are…

596
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,625
Frank Sinatra…

597
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,666
Chet Baker…

598
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Alice Mae King's "Love the Way."

599
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,791
Her mom liked the classics.

600
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,291
A QR code?

601
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:32,583
Day 49 on Mars, 9:47 p.m.

602
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:36,500
The wind's calm and quiet today.

603
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:40,083
The weather's been nice for days,
so I feel great.

604
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,000
I've got a surprise for you.

605
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,666
Drum roll, please. Ta-da!

606
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:49,708
The Amur adonis buds
have finally sprouted.

607
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:56,041
Today marks a major milestone as life
returns to the surface of this red planet.

608
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,458
Well, it's not exactly on the surface.

609
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,541
You have too many cavities.

610
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:28,166
Make sure you brush those teethies
before bed.

611
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,041
Listen to your dad.

612
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,625
Don't forget to eat your vegetables.

613
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,375
And work hard on your English.

614
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,750
Goodnight, sweetie.

615
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:38,583
That's her, isn't it?

616
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,541
No way.

617
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:59,291
DR. JOO NAN-YOUNG SELECTED AS A MEMBER
OF THE FOURTH MARS EXPEDITION TEAM

618
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,458
Why didn't you turn the light on,
and why didn't you call?

619
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,500
Right, I missed your call.

620
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,500
Sorry, I was really busy.

621
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,791
You even… cleaned?

622
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,166
Jay…

623
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:40,291
When were you going to tell me?

624
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,625
Today.

625
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,166
When did you find out?

626
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,625
A few days ago.

627
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,041
Was it

628
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,708
on the day I performed?

629
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,291
Yeah.

630
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,708
How could you…

631
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,541
Was this your secret?

632
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,083
I'm sorry.

633
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,125
I couldn't help it.

634
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:13,375
-The embargo was even on family--
-Right, family.

635
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,416
Does your dad know you're going?

636
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,291
He wouldn't know--

637
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:23,125
Still, you should've said something
in advance.

638
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:24,250
Jay.

639
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,708
Just be happy for me.

640
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:31,666
I've come so far just for this.

641
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,916
-You know that.
-Of course I do.

642
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:36,125
At least I thought I did.

643
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:39,208
But I had no idea
what you were trying to do.

644
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:40,291
I was foolish.

645
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,916
I cheered you on like an idiot,
not knowing you were doomed.

646
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,791
Jay.

647
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,041
Do you really have to go?

648
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:58,166
You could die if you go.

649
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,958
Jay, please don't do this.

650
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,333
Did you go through my stuff?

651
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,791
Does that really matter right now?

652
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:17,708
To me, it feels like
you're heading toward death!

653
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,958
What you saw is the worst-case scenario!

654
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,500
That's never going to happen to me!

655
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,208
You think I'm a fool.
You only try to justify yourself!

656
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,291
This is why I couldn't tell you.

657
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,458
Because you're nothing like my dad.

658
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,208
I can't be like your father.

659
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:33,541
I can't live my life
just staring at the sky,

660
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,875
holding out for someone
who might never come back!

661
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,458
Oh, really? I see.

662
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,333
Then let's end things here.

663
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:00,916
You…

664
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,333
are so cruel.

665
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,458
NAN-YOUNG'S

666
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,541
Dad, I'm going to Mars.

667
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:02,541
How could Mom
only think about herself like that?

668
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:08,541
-By now, she must have reached orbit.
-You did it again. The rain's coming in.

669
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,250
But you know what's even worse?

670
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:43,916
American Airlines flight 034
from Incheon to Florida…

671
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,416
DELETE JAY'S NUMBER?

672
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,041
I finally understand Mom.

673
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,666
Isn't that funny?

674
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,708
Are you okay?

675
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,541
Did you have a nightmare?

676
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,125
No, I'm good.

677
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,666
You scared me.

678
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:09,458
Your room stinks.
Let's get some fresh air in here.

679
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,583
The sun's beautiful today.

680
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:13,750
Come on, just leave me…

681
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,041
Take a look outside. Isn't it nice?

682
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,375
Jay, look at the waves!

683
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,583
Nan-young.

684
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,458
Your boyfriend sucks, right?

685
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:54,583
You finally figured that out?

686
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:57,500
I've got no style, no money.

687
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:01,541
And no patience.
I couldn't even hold back, so I came here.

688
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:02,583
Good.

689
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:04,833
I like you for that.

690
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:07,083
I like you because you suck.

691
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,708
Joo Nan-young, you've got odd taste.

692
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:11,791
What about you?

693
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:14,333
Do you wish you hadn't met me?

694
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:15,791
No.

695
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:17,958
Not at all.

696
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:21,041
The best thing I've done in my life

697
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:23,083
is meeting you.

698
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,291
Liar.

699
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:27,166
I mean it.

700
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,958
Honestly,

701
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,916
I still can't fully support…

702
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,708
what you're doing.

703
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:38,500
So please,

704
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,583
just come home safe.

705
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,875
That's all I'm asking.

706
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:51,083
I'm sorry for being selfish.

707
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:59,458
Then keep being selfish.

708
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,083
From now on,

709
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,625
until you come back.

710
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,916
Don't do anything dangerous,

711
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:10,458
and protect yourself first.

712
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,333
Promise me, Nan-young,

713
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:17,916
that you'll focus on coming back safely.

714
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,333
Okay.

715
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:27,958
I promise.

716
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,416
Excuse me.

717
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,708
Nan-young, I'm…

718
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,458
trying to move forward, just like you.

719
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:03,708
For me

720
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:05,833
and…

721
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:08,166
for you.

722
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,000
It's finally done!

723
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,666
To my number one fan.

724
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,625
I want you to hear it first.

725
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:47,708
For this song,

726
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:51,208
your opinion matters the most.

727
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:56,458
-It's good!
-I guess the one who wrote it knows best.

728
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:59,666
-The ending's not bad.
-Di-a, let's book the session.

729
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,041
-For your first album--
-On one condition.

730
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:03,916
-What?
-What is it?

731
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,541
I'm going to sing it on stage.

732
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:10,458
My goodness.

733
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,708
IT'S FINALLY DONE!
I WANT YOU TO HEAR IT FIRST.

734
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:21,583
Jay, it's me.

735
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,958
The signal was better this morning,

736
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,666
so I turned on the communicator excitedly.

737
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,500
Your song finally downloaded.

738
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,291
You've finished it.

739
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,583
My first thought when I heard it…

740
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,666
was how much I miss you.

741
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,708
And how painful your loneliness was

742
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:29,750
during the times in your life
that I couldn't be a part of.

743
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,791
And that I'm sorry.

744
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:51,041
I'll be on Mars soon.

745
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,458
Even if we can't reach each other
for a while,

746
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,416
don't forget, Jay.

747
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,708
Out here in space,

748
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:02,750
there's someone

749
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,708
who's always rooting for you.

750
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:23,916
Stay strong, Jay.

751
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:51,875
Detected!

752
01:05:58,583 --> 01:05:59,416
Object found!

753
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:27,291
Should I go with you?
I don't want to send you alone.

754
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,708
I'll be back before lunch.

755
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,041
By the way,

756
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,500
could you heat up my lunch
while you're at it?

757
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:35,958
-I'll eat when I get back.
-Okay. Don't be late.

758
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:37,208
Yes, ma'am.

759
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,291
Are you at it again?

760
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,541
It's early. What now?

761
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:12,333
-I'm waking you up for rehearsal.
-Don't worry. I'll be on time.

762
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,541
By the way, I found your in-ear monitors.

763
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
Jay.

764
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:29,500
Sing for me. Right here.

765
01:07:58,333 --> 01:07:59,958
The battery's dead.

766
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:17,458
Target!

767
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,208
Life trace!

768
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,750
Suit, start recording.

769
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,666
Comms are unstable.
Switching to a log-based report.

770
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,708
Biomarkers have been detected
within a 500-meter radius.

771
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,291
I'll do a quick check and return.

772
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:02,166
-One more monitor here.
-Let's check the drums. Cue!

773
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,250
Di-a, how are the monitors?

774
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,041
All good.

775
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,500
Monitors are good!

776
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,583
Please turn the vocals up a bit.

777
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:18,583
Turn up the vocals over here!

778
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:28,583
Jay, focus. That was your cue.

779
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,791
-Sorry.
-This is your last chance.

780
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,625
Sorry. Let's start over.

781
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:36,833
Let's do another sound check!

782
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:54,791
The impact from the meteorite
has uncovered an underground lava cave.

783
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:00,750
Tracing route.

784
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,458
Route found!

785
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,708
Tracing route.

786
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,416
Suit, start recording.

787
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,583
Entering unidentified cave,
the source of the biomarkers.

788
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:41,916
Radio signal's weak.
Switching to recording…

789
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,041
I wrote that song about a former crush.

790
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:04,833
-Di-a!
-Di-a!

791
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:06,750
It's called "Moonlight."

792
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,333
Life trace!

793
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,500
Route found!

794
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:11,875
Tracing route.

795
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:40,666
Thank you for coming
to The Moles' showcase.

796
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:46,500
We've prepared something special
for all you fans here today.

797
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,000
Jay?

798
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,708
Jay!

799
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:27,208
Jay, it's me,

800
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,041
Nan-young.

801
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:36,833
You know what?

802
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:39,833
When I was young,
I never carried an umbrella with me.

803
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,041
But I never got caught in the rain.

804
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,750
Because Dad always came to meet me.

805
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,333
He was always looking up at the sky,

806
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:56,125
so he must've developed
a sixth sense for predicting rain.

807
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:59,458
Maybe I've gotten used to it.

808
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:02,458
Even now, I still don't carry an umbrella.

809
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,791
But you know what?

810
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:12,125
-The day you first said my name…
-Nan-young.

811
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:14,791
That day…

812
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:17,500
Can I call you by your name now?

813
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:21,125
…was the first time
I'd shared an umbrella as an adult.

814
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,291
It's also the day I fell for you.

815
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:34,416
If you're watching this,

816
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,416
it probably means
something unfortunate has happened.

817
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,250
Jay,

818
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,583
the funny thing is,

819
01:17:44,166 --> 01:17:46,083
instead of following the same path,

820
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:51,000
you might go in another direction
and find an oasis.

821
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,958
That's what you are to me.

822
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,250
You led me onto a path more beautiful
than I could have ever imagined.

823
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:16,125
It'll be tough,

824
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:18,500
but, Jay…

825
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:23,458
I hope you won't stay sad for too long.

826
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:28,875
Live without regrets and be yourself.

827
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,916
With your own voice.

828
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,750
Live a beautiful life.

829
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,333
Jay was never a singer, was he?

830
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:54,791
Hey, switch to camera three!

831
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:55,833
Go for a full shot!

832
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:57,375
Check mic one!

833
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,083
Don't forget, Jay.

834
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,291
Out here in space,

835
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:05,541
there's someone…

836
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,583
who's always rooting for you.

837
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:15,458
I lose myself to fun

838
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,250
In nameless cities…

839
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:25,458
Drifting to the unknown

840
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:32,291
Sleeping somewhere in between

841
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:39,375
For someone like me
Life is sometimes just hard to foresee

842
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:47,125
Holding my breath
I'll step through concrete mountains

843
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:53,541
I'll overcome it all
And wipe the dust off my face

844
01:19:55,708 --> 01:20:01,750
Many people are caught within a question

845
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:06,041
In between zero and one

846
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:09,375
Is where, they meet their love

847
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:16,166
Beyond the stars

848
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:19,166
Have a good ride, bon voyage

849
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,375
Time doesn't matter

850
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:26,166
We're meant for each other

851
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:30,500
Although we’re far apart

852
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:38,541
I’ll always find a way to your heart

853
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:40,708
-Hey!
-Oh!

854
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,041
-You should've done this sooner!
-Seriously.

855
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:00,791
Breaking news.

856
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:04,458
NASA reports that Korean astronaut
Dr. Joo Nan-young,

857
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:09,083
who left for a Mars expedition
last November, is currently missing.

858
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:11,875
Communication was lost
due to sudden weather changes,

859
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:16,541
causing Dr. Joo's current status
to remain uncertain for more than an hour.

860
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,875
Did she take an umbrella?

861
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:29,208
In a briefing,
after announcing the disappearance,

862
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,208
NASA shared plans…

863
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:33,708
-No…
-…to monitor for accidents…

864
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,791
-…due to weather anomalies…
-No!

865
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:37,833
…from Demeter, which still orbits Mars…

866
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:12,708
Jay.

867
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,750
I'm scared.

868
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,541
I just need a moment.
It's about Mr. Joo's family.

869
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:40,625
Visiting hours are over.
Please come back. Sir!

870
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,916
Mr. Joo.

871
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:50,875
May I… borrow this for a moment?

872
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:52,166
Do you also have…

873
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,750
a message to send up to the stars?

874
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:58,541
Yes.

875
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:21,958
Mom!

876
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:24,958
Mom!

877
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:28,500
Nan-young!

878
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:32,208
-Come to Mommy.
-Nan-young.

879
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,458
I wanted

880
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:37,500
to wrap you up in light.

881
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:38,916
What's for dinner?

882
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,708
-Well, how about instant noodles?
-Again?

883
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,000
I didn't want you to see

884
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,500
even a trace of the shadows inside me.

885
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:51,416
Could a nobody like me

886
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:54,708
dare to want someone as special as you?

887
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,208
I told myself to put an end to it.

888
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:02,083
But every morning, I'd wake up

889
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:04,375
and look for traces of you.

890
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,333
You taught me every day

891
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:12,000
that light and shadows are inseparable.

892
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:15,541
That without the shadows,

893
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:18,083
you cannot embrace the light.

894
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:21,333
Please…

895
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:23,416
Please…

896
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,666
Waiting indefinitely…

897
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:27,875
Honestly, sometimes,

898
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:29,791
it hurts quite a bit.

899
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:33,416
But if there's anything
as certain as the pain,

900
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:36,958
it's that I'll never give up on you.

901
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:38,958
So please,

902
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:41,333
don't give up on me either.

903
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:44,416
At the end of this wait,

904
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,166
come back

905
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:47,958
and save me.

906
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,666
Jay!

907
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,291
I'm sorry

908
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:17,125
for taking so long.

909
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,375
You're a crybaby.

910
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,083
No, I'm not crying.

911
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:32,541
Is your nose running, then?

912
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:40,833
No, stop.

913
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,541
No, Jay.

914
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:43,875
Don't leave me!

915
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:49,166
Please stay. I'm begging you, Jay!

916
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,083
Don't go!

917
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:54,125
Please don't leave me!

918
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,916
Jay, please.

919
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,333
It's so warm.

920
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:24,708
Mom?

921
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:26,500
Mom…

922
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:38,916
I love you.

923
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,583
I made it!

924
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:16,666
Nan… Nan-young.

925
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:17,791
Nan-young!

926
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,291
And one more thing…

927
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:23,583
-Nan-young, where are you?
-I'm alive.

928
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:27,375
I heard your message.

929
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:31,958
You sounded different somehow.

930
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,000
You are Jay, right?

931
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,333
It must be a Mars thing.

932
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:43,541
It feels like a dream.

933
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,500
It's definitely not a dream.

934
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:51,708
Now that I'm here, I just remembered…

935
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,333
There's

936
01:29:54,166 --> 01:29:57,708
something I never got to tell you.

937
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,333
I love you.

938
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,291
It's time for "This Day in History."

939
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:27,916
This event not only shook Korea
but the entire world.

940
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:33,875
What mesmerized the world more than
Dr. Joo Nan-young's miraculous rescue

941
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:37,333
was her discovery of the Amur adonis
while fighting for her life…

942
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:44,250
The distance reveals the things
I couldn't see before.

943
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:48,708
Things I didn't notice before I went away.

944
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:52,375
But they were always there…

945
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:57,333
right where I left them.

946
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,708
Under my feet.

947
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:06,750
Before my eyes.

948
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,958
Inside each of us.

949
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,375
And…

950
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:36,166
on… this star.

951
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:18,208
LOST IN STARLIGHT

952
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:56,250
