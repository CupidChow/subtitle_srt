Be together! Be together!

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,890
Be together! Be together!

Be together! Be together!

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,170
I...

22
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,840
Right now, I...

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,820
You don't like me anymore.

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,240
I understand.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,110
I didn't do this today to force you to make a decision.

26
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,750
I just wanted to publicly express how I feel about you.

27
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,280
I don't need you to give me an answer.

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,550
I just want a chance to protect you.

29
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,800
To help you when you're in need.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,220
To defend you when others hurt you.

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,500
I will do all of these things for a long time to come.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,740
All I'm asking is for you to accept it.

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,160
I know who you like.

34
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,400
But when you were younger, he lied to you. And when you got older, he bullied you.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,170
It could've been explained so easily, but he chose to hide it from you for so long.

36
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,920
It's okay if he doesn't like you. You have me—

37
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,900
You have us, those who like you.

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,330
Actually, it's okay if

39
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,430
the person by your side isn't me.

40
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,320
But I don't want to see you sad.

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,030
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

42
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,610
But the past is in the past.

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,310
♫ I really want to ask you, ”How are you?” ♫

44
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,730
Let's just leave it there.

45
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,810
♫ I couldn’t open my mouth to ask, I was too stupid ♫

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:57,100
♫ It is too difficult to say, “Are you there?” ♫

47
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,220
♫ I can only secretly watch you on the side ♫

48
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,710
Drink some water.

49
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,930
Don't be too sad.

50
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,030
I know you did everything you could.

51
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,880
Your acting was so good, it almost moved me.

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,240
I wasn't acting.

53
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,570
Everything that I said, I've wanted to tell her for a long time now.

54
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,780
Tang Xue is such a lucky girl.

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,740
So many people care about her so much.

56
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,520
Who says?

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,690
Aren't you an exception?

58
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,400
As expected, you don't miss anything.

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,510
Why do you hate your cousin so much?

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,660
Grandma!

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,390
Grandma, I received a good student award today!

62
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,820
Our family is going to have a top student soon. Ran-ran,

63
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,890
let Grandma see.

64
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,910
Mom! Xiao Xue's short track speed skating competition is starting soon. Let's hurry and go watch!

65
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,990
Wait for me!

66
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,990
Our school is having a school-wide public speaking competition.

67
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,930
Every class can only send one representative.

68
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,980
The first place can go enter the district-level competition, then the province-level competition.

69
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,730
Eventually, the national competition.

70
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,920
Are any classmates interested?

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,350
Zhou Ran! Zhou Ran!

72
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,620
Zhou Ran.

73
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,120
Teacher, I don't think I should go.

74
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm worried that I won't do well and embarrass our class.

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,240
Teacher, I'll go in her place.

76
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,570
Okay, then Tang Xue will represent our class in the competition.

77
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,200
Let's continue with the class.

78
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Zhou Ran, I took the hit for you, why are you still unhappy?

79
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,220
Who asked you to take the hit for me?

80
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,950
I've been preparing for this competition for half a month now.

81
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,280
Then, why didn't you tell the teacher? You even said you didn't want to compete.

82
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,860
I was being polite. Don't you know what being polite is?

83
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,120
Is that so? I get it now.

84
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,490
All right. We just have the 3000-meter race left that no one has signed up for.

85
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,040
Does anyone want to enter?

86
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,960
Why would anyone sign up for the 3000-meter race?

87
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,920
Zhou Ran, you haven't signed up for an activity yet, right?

88
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,210
I can't, I can't. I'm not good at sports. If I go, it'll just be embarrassing.

89
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,460
I was being polite. Don't you know what being polite is?

90
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,190
Teacher, I volunteer Zhou Ran for the 3000-meter race.

91
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,530
Okay, then Zhou Ran, you'll do the 3000-meter race.

92
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,160
Nothing really. Our personalities just don't mesh.

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,550
Enough talking about me. Have you thought about what you're going to do next?

94
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,590
People are so worthless sometimes.

95
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,630
After what happened today, I'm even more unwilling to let her go.

96
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,390
About Tang Xue and Li Yubing, you must be upset, too. Right?

97
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,230
Shall we go have a drink?

98
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,750
I know who you like.

99
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,240
But when you were younger, he lied to you.

100
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,230
And when you got older, he bullied you.

101
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,900
It could've been explained so easily, but he chose to hide it from you for so long.

102
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,490
It's okay if the person by your side isn't me.

103
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,470
But I don't want to see you sad.

104
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,560
Tang Xue, I...

105
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,390
Li Yubing.

106
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,410
Back then, was I really unlikable?

107
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,290
Be honest.

108
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,090
When I was little, I really disliked you.

109
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,110
I thought you were overbearing and you always bullied me.

110
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,600
So going to a different school was the only way I could think of to avoid you.

111
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,480
Although I didn't mean to,

113
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,420
if I think about it, there were a lot of times I went overboard.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,100
Because I kept dwelling on these things,

115
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,160
when we first met again at LUU,

116
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,690
I went overboard with a lot of things, too.

117
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,730
I'm sorry, too.

118
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,090
But all of that is in the past. Can we start over?

119
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,220
But I can't put it behind me.

120
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,230
Even though you lied to me,

121
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,430
I'm more angry at myself.

122
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,290
I didn't pick up your calls because I didn't know how to face you.

123
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,720
I had no idea how other people saw me.

124
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,980
I didn't even know that I had hurt other people.

125
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,300
The fact that you would rather lie than go to the same school as me,

126
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,750
it means that my good image of myself back then was all in my imagination.

127
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,420
I no longer know who I am anymore.

128
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,390
You're just you.

129
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,100
When I was little, I only saw one side of you. Until we were at LUU, I saw all of you.

130
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,940
I know you are overbearing.

131
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,680
I know you like being the boss. I know you barged into the mens' showers.

132
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,290
I know you sing off-key. I know you have a strong sense of loyalty.

133
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,080
I know you will endure no matter what.

134
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,670
I know you're compassionate, brave, and honest.

135
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,280
All of these things are you. This is the you that I like.

136
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,280
Really?

137
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,750
I won't lie to you anymore.

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,230
♫ Snowflakes are falling, do you see them? ♫

139
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,460
Because I don't ever want to be separated from you again.

140
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,740
In the future, you can't dislike me. You can only like me.

141
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,460
♫ Snowflakes are falling, I want to become them ♫

♫ Year after year, they stay by your side as a sweet fairy tale ♫

143
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,450
I have to go back tomorrow.

144
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,850
If I stay any longer, it's going to be New Year's.

145
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,360
My parents will disown me.

146
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Huan-huan, I don't want you to leave.

147
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,050
I don't want to leave either.

148
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,710
By the way, Huan-huan, there's a White Pagoda Temple near here that's pretty well-known.

149
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,630
I'll take you there tomorrow to walk around.

150
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,770
Tomorrow's the last day.

151
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,270
I want to cherish every minute and every second with you.

152
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,480
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

153
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,250
But I'm still worried about Master Tang. She must still be angry at Li Yubing.

154
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,260
How about we invite her to come with us and get her mind off things?

155
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,640
My Huan-huan is so considerate.

156
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,530
- I'll ask her.
- Okay.

157
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,710
I'll ask her right now.

158
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,710
Master Tang, tomorrow Huan-huan wants you to come with us to the White Pagoda Temple to take your mind off some matters.

159
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,910
She responded instantly.

160
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,840
Okay, but I'm bringing a tag-along.

161
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,340
A tag-along? Who?

162
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,630
[Tang Xue]

163
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Hello?

164
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,020
- Let's go to the White Pagoda Temple tomorrow, a four-person date (double date).
- Okay.

165
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,380
We'll leave at 8:30, see you then.

166
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,970
I give you permission to dream of me tonight.

167
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,100
I give you permission to flirt with me in your dreams tonight.

168
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,730
Bye-bye.

169
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,930
A private date?
(T/N: Private and four person sound similar)

170
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,820
Didn't you say private date? Why...

171
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,420
You must've heard it wrong. I said four-person date.

172
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,650
Double date. Four people.

173
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,600
You don't want to?

174
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,540
If you don't want to, you can go home.

175
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,600
No, I like coming out and walking around.

176
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,190
Why is Li Yubing here?

177
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,180
I don't know.

178
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,200
Did Master Tang forgive him just like that?

179
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,160
What's their relationship? Are they dating?

180
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't be ridiculous.

181
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,200
I think Master Tang is just open-minded and forgiving.

182
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,230
Listen to yourself. Are you saying I'm narrow-minded and unforgiving?

183
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,630
That's not what I meant.

184
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,670
Huan-huan–

185
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,050
She's so cute even when she's angry.

186
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,020
Amitaba.

187
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,540
What are they doing?

188
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,290
They're praying to Buddha for good fortune.

189
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,060
They say this incense burner is very lucky.

190
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,420
If your coin makes it into the top level, your wish will come true.

191
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,130
Really? I'll just climb up then.

192
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,940
This is the forbidden place of Buddha, don't mess around.

193
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,890
It went in!

194
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,620
Master Tang, you're incredible. You got it on your first try.

195
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,700
It's Master Tang of all people. Isn't that right Master Tang?

196
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,360
Why do you put your input in for everything?

197
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,060
How is Master Tang related to incense burners? She's not called Master Incense Burner.

198
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,430
I need to make it in today.

199
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,570
By the time you make it in, who knows how long we'll have waited for?

200
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,200
Master Tang, if you guys want to go look around, go ahead.

201
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,430
I won't leave here until I make it in.

202
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,510
Okay, then we'll go first. See you later.

203
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,100
- Bye-bye Master Tang.
- Bye-bye.

204
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,570
- Money.
- What?
- Money!

205
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,770
Here. Us narrow-minded people don't like taking other people's money.

206
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,750
No need.

207
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,600
So close, try another one.

208
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,320
Use more force.

209
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,110
That was so close.

210
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,060
- So close.
- Wait, my wallet. Hey!

211
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,870
He stole my wallet!

212
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,650
Stop! Don't run!

213
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,810
Stop!

214
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,660
Why aren't you running anymore? With your physical strength, you still want to be a thief?

215
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,520
Keep running.

216
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,690
- I'm so exhausted.
- What happened? Don't pretend to be dead.

217
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,580
Get up!

218
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,370
Run now.

219
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,180
This is bad.

220
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,150
What's wrong?

221
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,250
Unconcious. Huan-huan, hurry and call an ambulance.

222
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,660
- Quickly.
- Okay.

223
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,330
Hello. 120. I'm at Hucheng's White Pagoda Temple

224
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,320
at the entrance to Broad Burner Hall. Someone fainted.

225
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,450
Okay, come quickly.

226
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,880
Let me through. Let me look.

227
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,910
Doctor, this person suddenly collapsed while running. The reason for this is unknown.

228
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,340
Blue lips, pale limbs, shortness of breath, unconsciousness.

229
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,460
While I was waiting for you guys to come, I already did CPR for him.

230
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,620
Now, his carotid artery has regained its pulse.

231
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,770
His breathing has been restored as well.

232
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,450
After this, please take him back to do a further examination.

233
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,940
Get him on the stretcher. Hurry up and contact the emergency room.

234
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,730
You know how to do first-aid during the golden hour. Are you a doctor?

235
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm a medical student from LUU, I just happened to be around when it happened. It's nothing much.

236
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,580
How fortunate.

237
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,910
Oh right, Doctor. He stole my girlfriend's wallet.

238
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,390
When he wakes up, can you have him contact us to return it to us?

239
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,410
You guys come with us then.

240
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,460
- We'll get going first.
- Okay.

241
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,090
Let's go.

242
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,530
Why are you looking at me like that?

243
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Huan-huan, you're not angry at me anymore?

244
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,700
You're so handsome, how could I be angry?

245
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,760
You're usually always just following me around, like my little footman.

246
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,400
I almost forgot that

247
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,130
you were going to be a doctor in the future.

248
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm willing to follow you around.

249
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,470
Tell me. Where do you want me to follow you to next?

250
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,460
Kiss me.

251
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,430
Yuantong Hall.

252
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,420
There are so many people here.

253
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,370
Let's go pray here. This must be the right one.

254
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,830
- Kneel, kneel.
- Get up first.

255
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,640
Kneel!

256
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,620
You're in this much of a rush?

257
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,670
We just started dating, and you're praying to the Buddha of Fertility.

258
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,070
I'm sorry for disturbing you. Happy New Year!

259
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,320
Don't laugh at me.

260
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,490
Idiot.

261
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,360
I'm telling you. Don't get all physical. This is where Buddha is.

262
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,260
If you make Buddha upset,

263
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,870
they'll give you boy-girl twins.

264
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,380
You— You stop right there! Don't run!

265
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,960
You're really not feminine at all.

266
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,920
I'm not some sparrow.

267
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm a flamingo. Do you have a problem with it?

268
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,100
No, no. Flamingoes are my favorite.

269
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,900
The view is so pretty.

270
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,960
Are you hungry?

271
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,150
Let me ask Xia Menghuan where they are.

272
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,690
Let's have a goodbye dinner with them.

273
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,210
- Where are you guys?
- The hospital.

274
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,700
Which one of you is sick?

275
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,680
No one's sick. The thief who stole my wallet is sick.

276
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,000
Liao Zhenyu saved him today.

277
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,600
He also returned my wallet.

278
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,160
Anyway, today has just been a really weird day.

279
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,700
By the way, Master Tang.

280
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,130
I don't have much time left so I have to get to the station soon,

281
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,530
I don't think I can eat with you guys tonight. I'll see you when school starts.

282
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,460
Bye-bye.

283
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,670
What happened?

284
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,430
I have no idea either.

285
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,870
Excuse me, Doctor. How's the patient?

286
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,170
The patient's doing a lot better now.

287
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,630
The two of them are brothers. They haven't had a dad since they were young.

288
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,130
They wanted to make some money to pay for their mom's medical bills.

289
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,660
So they go to crowded places to pickpocket.

290
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,830
The older brother has congenital heart disease.

291
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,390
Poor kids.

292
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,910
We're prepared to treat the older brother without charging them any money,

293
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,930
but their lives...

294
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,440
I understand. Then...

295
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,160
we could crowdsource some funds for them and see if that can help him in some ways.

296
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,320
That's a good idea.

297
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,760
They're quite fortunate to have met you two.

298
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Do you guys want to go in and see them?

299
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,890
We... Forget it.

300
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,080
If the patient sees us, he might panic. It might affect his condition.

301
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,840
- We'll just head out.
- That's true.

302
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,760
Wait.

303
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,950
I only have this much.

304
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,840
Doctor, we're students. We don't have much money.

305
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,250
It's not much, but here. Can you give this to them for us?

306
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,910
Thank you on their behalf.

307
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,400
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

308
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,740
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

309
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,950
How pitiful.

310
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,540
When I was their age, all I had to worry about was grades.

311
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,800
The first time I understood what it meant to be a doctor,

312
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,570
was when I saw a video about foreign refugees.

313
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,740
I remember that the foreign refugees were lying naked in their tent.

314
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,570
Flocks of flies landed on their faces and they had no energy to drive them away.

315
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,090
I was really immature at this time. I wanted to become a hero like the ones in comic books.

316
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,530
I would suddenly show up in front of them and cure all their illnesses.

317
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,150
Later on, I met Master Tang's mom.

318
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,690
She helped me fix my stuttering.

319
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,370
From then on, I became determined to become a doctor.

320
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,860
So that I could help thousands and thousands of refugees and help them solve their problems.

321
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,360
Wow, so you have a passionate dream-chasing side to you.

322
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,120
Where's the dream-chasing youth now?

323
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,240
The dream-chasing youth is still here.

324
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,270
You are my dream.

325
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,650
I just managed to get into college.

326
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,650
I should spend some time dating my Goddess

327
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,700
and enjoying the freedom of life, right?

328
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,890
Liao Zhenyu. Let me tell you...

329
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,670
I like the kind of guys who are working hard to pursue their dreams, who never give up, and have lofty goals.

330
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,700
Don't just treat me like a pet rabbit. After a while, if you're just a rabbit keeper, you'll have lost your attractiveness.

331
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,630
That... makes sense.

332
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,910
Don't you have to go soon?

333
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,020
I have to get my luggage, too. Let's go.

334
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,490
- Okay, okay.
- I'm going to be late.

335
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,160
Okay, then after you see off Huan-huan, come meet up with us. Bye-bye.

336
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,340
Are you sure your dad isn't home? Let me tell you. I'm going to have mental trauma soon.

337
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,900
My dad is just protective of me. Later on, after I explain everything to him, he'll understand.

338
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,830
Hurry up and confess to him. Or else every time I come to your house, I feel like a thief.

339
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,340
So this is what your house looks like.

340
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,350
What else? Do you think I'm actually a demon who lives in a cave?

341
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,900
Demon, you never thought of it. Right?

342
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,860
Now your true self has been subdued by me.

343
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,150
- Get the door.
- You go, you go.

344
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,310
You brought this much stuff?

345
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,600
Today, when I was talking to Huan-huan, Auntie came up in the conversation.

346
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,560
So I started to miss her a lot.

347
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,130
You're here?

348
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,540
I bought these for Auntie, give them to her for me.

349
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,210
How nice of you.

350
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,750
I heard you were a hero today and that you even saved someone.

351
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,030
Yes, Master Tang, I did.

352
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,690
I even received a kiss from Huan-huan for it.

353
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,340
If I get to have a good meal, too, today will be perfect.

354
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,260
We'll satisfy you very soon. Go wash the vegetables in a bit.

355
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,820
- Go cut the vegetables.
- Okay, okay.

356
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,460
Master Tang, for this hotpot, if I'm washing vegetables and he's cutting them, are you just eating?

357
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,030
Yeah.

358
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,830
Impressive.

359
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,660
- Hold on, hold on.
- Can you do it?

360
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,740
Hurry up.

361
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
Bomb!

362
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,280
I like the kind of guys who are working hard to pursue their dreams,

363
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,560
who never give up, and have lofty goals.

364
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,540
Don't just treat me like a pet rabbit.

365
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,420
After awhile, if you're just a rabbit keeper, you'll lose all your attractiveness.

366
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,740
What are you doing?

367
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,410
What's on your mind?

368
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,720
Li Yubing,

369
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,850
do you think I look like someone who doesn't have any dreams?

370
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:57,730
You do. Isn't your dream to marry Xia Menghuan and orbit around her?

371
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,740
Don't girls like that kind of feeling?

372
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,160
How do I say this? It depends on the person.

373
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,400
- Huan-huan? I'm going to go take this call.
- Okay, go.

374
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,640
Huan-huan!

375
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,730
Wow!

376
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,860
You didn't practice for nothing. You've built a lot of muscle.

377
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,050
So you were the one always sleeping next to my girlfriend.

378
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,150
You're not allowed to watch her sleep. From now on, you'll come and sleep with me.

379
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,400
I've missed out on so much.

380
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,250
The capsule toys.

381
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,390
These were all bought with my allowance.

382
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,720
This is my present for you.

383
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,920
It's so cute! I thought it was real.

384
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,280
Son, are you dumb?

385
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,400
How can you give a spider to a girl as a birthday present?

386
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,650
If you keep on being like this,

387
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,060
in the future, you're going to be single forever.

388
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,860
On the road to fighting against you, I was walking too arduously.

389
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,230
So I've decided to just surrender.

390
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,000
Pig.

391
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,580
- Son, you're back?
- Mom.

392
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,840
- Come eat some fruit.
- Okay.

393
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,940
Dad.

394
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,220
You're back so late, where'd you go?

395
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,460
What?

396
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,370
What's wrong?

397
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,760
I'm tired, I'm going to go to bed.

398
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,730
Get some rest.

399
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,500
Honey, something big has happened.

400
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,640
What is it?

401
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,900
- Yubing put on eyeliner.
- What?

402
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,590
Eyeliner.

403
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,400
Your eyesight must be getting worse.

404
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,460
He didn't wash it off properly, you can still see the outline.

405
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,060
And that pink dinosaur.

406
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,070
My goodness.

407
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,400
I hoped for him to bring a girl home.

408
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,560
Now he's gone and made himself a girl.

409
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,200
Don't say such ridiculous things about our son so carelessly.

410
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,900
That is so terrifying. Let's make sure we have all the facts first.

411
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,730
Xiao Xue, Dad's back!

412
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,920
Dad.

413
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,910
What's wrong with you?

414
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,730
Did you do this because you don't like your own gender, or

415
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,660
is this because you like "The Tales of Effendi?"
(T/N: Chinese animated film)

416
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,170
I forgot to wash it off.

417
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,730
Why is the fridge completely empty?

418
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,950
Some friends came over to eat hotpot!

419
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,390
You're quite modest! Are you sure you didn't invite an elephant over to eat hotpot?

420
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,820
You guys cleaned up pretty well.

421
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,900
Of course, I, Master Tang, trained them well.

422
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,220
That's why they have such good habits.

423
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,000
Which friends? Did Bian Cheng come?

424
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,040
Bian Cheng is really a great kid.

425
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,930
No, it was Liao Zhenyu and...

426
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,420
someone else you don't know.

427
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,960
It wouldn't be... Li Yubing, is it?

428
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,120
That kid is dishonest, you shouldn't hang out with him.

429
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,630
Dad, that was so long ago, and I was at fault, too.

430
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,600
It's all resolved now, so stop bringing it up.

431
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,200
It's okay if it's resolved.

432
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,100
But I won't allow you to continue getting closer with him.

433
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,850
How much is this year's pocket money?

434
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,860
No comment.

435
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,120
Then I'll let you know how much I need to eat, you can take it into account.

436
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,730
Hey!

437
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,830
You guys are already together, what are you worried about?

438
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,100
The biggest problem right now is her parents still don't know.

439
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,190
- Would it be better if you just told them? 
- No, I'm still worried they won't accept it.

440
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,020
Yubing, your dad wants to ask what you want to eat for tonight's New Years' dinner.

441
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,060
I'm okay with anything, up to you guys.

442
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,630
Okay. Let's go start cooking.

443
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,420
Hello? Just now, my parents—

444
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,240
Dad. Mom. It's New Year's. Is something going on?

445
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,900
In this day and age, maybe it's not anything.

446
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Bing-bing, do you want to have a drink with Dad?

447
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,800
Dad, college students can't drink alcohol.

448
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,080
Right, right, I forgot. I'll drink by myself.

449
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,370
If something's going on, don't hide it from me.

450
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,500
- You too, Yubing.
- Me?

451
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,860
By the way, I want to ask you guys about something. Do you remember Xu Feng?

452
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,110
- Why does this name sound so familiar?
- A guy.

453
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,630
Oh, right, I almost forgot. Why are you asking about him?

454
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:19,160
He's also a hockey player, right? I really like him.

455
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,710
I want to get to know him better.

456
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,090
- Why do you like—
- I really like that kid, too.

457
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,630
Today is New Year's, let's not discuss this matter for now.

458
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,220
It's New Year's, we should have a good time tonight.

459
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,250
Yubing, don't worry. Dad will ask around about it.

460
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,890
- Let's toast to a happy New Year.
- Okay.

461
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,320
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

462
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,420
Cheers!

463
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,570
This wine is good.

464
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,890
I'll start. It's New Year's again.

465
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,670
As tradition, let's applaud and welcome

466
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,330
my daughter to sing a song for us!

467
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,910
Woo!

468
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,470
I won't sing.

469
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,070
- Why not?
- Yeah.

Every year, you guys make me sing and tell me I sing well.

471
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,710
I was so unaware and got teased so much about it at school.

472
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,090
Who told my daughter the truth?

473
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,890
No, no. How can they say that about my daughter? Who is our daughter?

474
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,500
She sings so well! You're not a singer,

475
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,400
so as long as your singing makes us happy. It's good singing.

476
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,720
Exactly. Your dad is right, I completely agree.

477
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,500
If it's my daughter, no matter how off-key it is,

478
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,510
it's the best singing in the world.

Back to what we were talking about,

00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,300
since our Xiao Xue is going to be a vet. Right?

484
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:04,370
All you have to do is study veterinary medicine well, and you'll be successful.

485
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,790
I've got it all planned. I've wanted to get a dog for awhile now,

486
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,200
but everyone says the medical fees for dogs are more expensive than for humans.

487
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,370
But I don't have to worry about that anymore. My daughter is going to be a vet.

488
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,200
If there's anything wrong with the dog, you can take care of it easily.

489
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,720
All thanks to our Xiao Xue.

One time, Li Yubing was doing pushups in our bedroom.

Old Deng was watching TV and picking his feet at Li Yubing at the same time.
