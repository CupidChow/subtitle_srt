[Episode 40]

18
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,570
Thank you for telling me the truth.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,060
Ever since I got injured,

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,130
I was quite downcast and there has been a lot of criticism online.

21
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,170
My future is unknown right now,

22
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,380
so it's normal for advertisements to terminate the contract.

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,960
I just didn't expect

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,640
that the club had to pay the penalty.

25
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,190
Manager Ma hasn't thought of any good ideas.

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,830
Yeah.

27
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,670
For me, he was about to sell his precious car.

28
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm really grateful to him,

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,230
but if it wasn't because of me then he wouldn't have bad relations with his dad.

How come you're just getting here?

32
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,020
- Bing- bing, you already know?
- Yes.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,110
It's all right. We'll think of a solution together.

34
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,200
As I said, we will think of something as long as we do it together.
(T/N: three ignorant cobblers add up to a genius)

Relax. I've experienced so much already.

Hello?

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,310
We're waiting for you in the break room.

41
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,940
- You guys?
- Yes.

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,810
Everyone.

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,810
This is...

44
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,240
- Manager Ma.
- Our topic today is...

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,390
how to pay the penalty for the advertisements.

46
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,330
I believe that with everyone here, we can think of a good idea.

47
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,790
Thank you, everyone.

48
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,610
But I think I should borrow money from my parents first.

49
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,940
Yubing, I think you shouldn't bother your parents about this for now.

50
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,890
Manager Ma,

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,920
even though I haven't been at LUU for long,

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,030
I've already seen Yubing as my brother.

53
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,730
How about this?

54
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,790
This is my allowance. It's not much though.

55
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,090
I can also pawn my trophies.

56
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,640
Yu Yan, help me pawn my medals, too.

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,110
I've also thought it through.

58
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,650
We'll take out all our leftover living expense fees.

59
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,770
Take it out.

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,900
This is Old Xu's and my money for the wedding.

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,430
Use it for this emergency.

62
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,280
Wait a second.

63
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,740
I know everyone is trying to help me,

64
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,490
and I appreciate it but I have to say this.

65
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,030
Can we not use the method of using each other's money as a solution?

66
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,730
What other solution is there?

67
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,580
How about we go sell blood? That's a lot quicker.

68
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,560
I think I should go and work.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,990
There's not enough time to work. There are only five days left.

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
Take it.

71
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,400
- You...
- Take it.

72
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,450
But this position is very hot right now,

73
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,670
- you might not be able to get in.
- Why is that?

74
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,130
Is it because the benefits are very good?

75
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,100
Of course, the benefits are good. But other than that, what is more appealing,

76
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,520
is the best looking guys in the school are all on that team.

77
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,510
On the first day I came to report,

78
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,100
someone told me...

79
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,000
the best looking guys in the school are all on the hockey team.

80
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,950
We can sell our faces.

81
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,240
- I think there's no problem with that.
- I agree.

82
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,860
How are we supposed to sell our faces?

83
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,910
We can model for magazines and stuff.

84
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,980
The cute ones.

85
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,020
Yes. The purchasing power of fans is very high.

86
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,770
We can also develop spin-offs, such as desk calendars, notebooks, and such.

87
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,840
We can make more money then.

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,890
I take back what I said tonight.

89
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,620
You women are able to think of a solution more.

90
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,350
Wait. Is this reliable?

91
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,360
Even if each dorm at school buys one,

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,430
we still won't be able to earn the amount needed.

93
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,410
I think we need to increase the power to rally supporters.

94
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,030
Power to rally supporters?

95
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,960
Power to rally supporters?

96
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,230
I got it.

97
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,360
Fatty,

98
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,870
say what solution do you think Manager Ma has?

99
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,720
How would I know?

100
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,360
Stop worrying.

101
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,600
What are you guys doing?

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,010
Aren't we shooting photos? Then we need to be extra manly.

103
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,670
I'm not talking about that. Why are you taking off your clothes?

104
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,800
Hurry and put them back on.

105
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Disgusting.

106
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,310
Why are you blushing, then?

107
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,710
Students, look and see who's here.

108
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,680
Xu Feng!

109
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,550
Enough. Keep quiet.

110
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,080
Xu Feng, I'm really thankful that you came to help with this favor.

111
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,420
I should. I also hope that I can do something for LUU's ice hockey team.

112
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,310
I already heard about the situation from Ma Xiaoshan.

113
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,980
I think we'll be fine. All the difficulties are temporary.

114
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,880
- We'll overcome them together.
- Yes!

115
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,170
Handsome, can I take a picture with you?

116
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,210
You can't.

117
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,310
- Me too!
- You don't need it.

118
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,290
Watch your manners. Don't embarrass me today.

119
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,240
Yubing, you look better.

120
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,060
Much better than when I met you last time.

121
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,020
When are you planning to get back to the field?

122
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,010
- Actually, I—
- Bing-bing always wanted to get back there.

123
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,350
But before his health recovers, we won't let him go on. Isn't that right, Bing-bing?

124
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,930
That... Ice God, you're my idol.

125
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,160
Can I take a picture with you?

126
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,590
Behave yourself.

127
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,210
I can't hold it in anymore either.

128
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,520
Ice God, you're also my idol. In a while, give me your autograph and let's take a picture.

129
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,460
Oh right, Ice God. When you have time, help persuade Li Yubing.

130
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,150
He wants to get back on the rink. He keeps secretly practicing but his body can't handle it.

131
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,540
Don't talk about the past. It's meaningless to mention that now.

132
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,230
I'm not talking about the past.

133
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,590
You need to rest well to be fully recovered. Once you're all better, we still have a battle.

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,550
That... Ice God, count me in for a picture.

135
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,470
You guys are bullying me as a cover to be fanboys, right?

136
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,070
That's right! I can tell, too. Ma Xiaoshan, you called me here not to solve hardships

137
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,960
but to take pictures with them.

138
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,690
- No.
- I finally understand, Ice God.

139
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,790
- Enough. Let's start working.
- Let's go!

140
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,540
Come on.

141
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,470
The pictures weren't bad.

142
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,290
- Ice God.
- Sit.
- You're here.

143
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,940
You young folks talk. I won't be in your way.

144
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,490
Hello, I'm Tang Xue from the short track speed skating team.

145
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,570
- You've worked hard today. Drink this.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,420
Yubing, after coming today, I finally realized how blissful you are.

147
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,220
Look at the people around you.

148
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,260
Your coach, manager, teammates, and friends all support you.

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,970
Give yourself some confidence. You can definitely go back on the rink.

150
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,950
Okay, I know.

151
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,530
Of course, what's most important is your girlfriend.

152
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,860
She's such a nice girl.

153
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,740
Do you know why he's the Ice God?

154
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,620
He has such good taste and sharp eyes. He knows I'm a good girl the first time he met me.

155
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,160
Don't make her proud, Ice God.

156
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,850
She's about to join the national team. It's very competitive there.

157
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,480
- Don't you know how to be modest?
- That's good.

158
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,920
This is called confidence. I can tell.

That's right.

that the sound of the waves is full of changes.

who is willing to see a person like me give a speech on stage?

At that time, my head was filled with taking revenge on Li Yubing,

I'm going to the national team tomorrow.

Be good.

334

I'm not sure about that.

You can do it.

341
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,560
You came all the way here to give me this?

342
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,180
Didn't I promise you

343
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,280
that when you join the national team, I would bring corn to welcome you.

344
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,350
I'm about to go abroad to do training and compete.

345

I'll be gone for a long time.

If you have some technical problems that you don't understand,

347
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,510
then you can just call or text me.

348
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:39,100
Brother Dajing, do you think I can be like you and also get a championship?

349
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,070
And run around the rink with the five-starred red flag in my hand bringing honor to our country?

350
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,480
Do you remember what I told you?

351
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,760
You have to believe in yourself and follow your dreams.

352
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,580
Thank you.

353
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,540
You were the one who told me to keep going after I joined short track speed skating again.

Hi, Xiao Yu. Did you see it? I finally saw the sloths.

I'm coming back next week.

You have to study well and wait for me to come back.

- Hello.
- Hello!

00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,780
Who's this foreigner?

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,170
This one?

378
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,420
He's my classmate.

379
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,090
Your classmate?

380
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,640
Your classmate can put his arm on your shoulder?

381
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,200
Did you become so open-minded abroad now?

382
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,130
He just put his hand there. Everyone does that here.

383
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,890
No matter how outgoing they are, he can't put his arm on your shoulder.

384
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,230
Hurry and come back.

385
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,060
If you don't come back then I'll go over there to capture you back.

Okay, I know.

389
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,500
The ability to judge and make a decision is vital for people to live in society.

390
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,580
People will measure this ability in their minds.

391
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,870
The one with less ability

392
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,470
is deemed as inferior and weak in surviving

393
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,090
and will even be eliminated.

394
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,780
Every time someone mentions our mistakes

395
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,460
or questions our ability to judge and make decisions,

396
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,580
most people will think they are in an inferior position in the game of judgment.

397
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,400
Then, how would they feel?

398
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,930

it's enough to win one person's heart.

Open it and take a look.

417
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,490
Is it heat-insulating?

I drew this myself.

Also, when I did this, I accidentally cut my finger.

Cambridge University is in England.

434
