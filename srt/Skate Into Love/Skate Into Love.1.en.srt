Dear audience, welcome! Today, you're watching

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,040
the Hucheng Cup Youth Short Track Speed Skating Tournament.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,620
In this tournament, we invited 42 high schools in the province

21
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,270
and over 200 athletes to come participate.

22
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,210
Short track speed skating is a winter Olympic sport.

23
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,750
Athletes will speed skate down the short track.

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,650
- The competition uses an elimination system, including heats...
- Go Tang Xue!

25
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,520
...a semi-final, and final.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,890
What you're about to watch is the women's 500-meter finals.

27
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,180
Four athletes will compete on a 111.12 meter track

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,630
for 4.5 laps.

29
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,670
As long as they are not breaking the rules of the sport, athletes can overtake each other at any time.

30
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,740
This will make today's competition very exciting!

31
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,940
Let's look forward to it!

32

The competition starts!

35
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,660
Number 60, Tang Xue, is in the lead already, behind her is number 302, He Mei, and number 105, Zhao Xiaoyu

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,760
in second and third place. There are 3 more laps.

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,760
As we all know, the 500-meter is a short race. The starting speed is crucial.

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,060
Will Tang Xue maintain her position or will other athletes pass her?

39
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,960
We can see that He Mei, still in second, is closing the gap, looking for a chance to pass Tang Xue.

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,990
Two more laps. He Mei is moving away from the curve, using the outer track to move ahead.

41
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,350
Zhao Xiaoyu is on the inner track, in one move she overtakes Tang Xue and He Mei.

42
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,840
Tang Xue is accelerating from the outer track, she's moving really quickly.

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,620
Nice, she passed them!

44
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,350
It's the last lap!

45
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,520
Nice! Tang Xue is the first to the finish line. Tang Xue wins!

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,500
Tang Xue, you performed well today. Keep practicing!

47
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,050

It's all my dad's fault.

Before I return to school,

55
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,950
he insisted on making stewed pig trotters with soybeans and stewed radish and ribs.

56
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,030
Is this my fault? These two things are in my stomach right now creating chemical reactions.

57

Stop laughing. After not seeing me for half a month, do you miss getting beaten up?

No, no. Since I came all the way to escort you to LUU, don't be angry at me anymore.
(LUU is short for Lincheng Union University)

How about you transfering to our veterinary medicine department?

In the short track speed skating world cup that just ended,

67

Wu Dajing yet again showed his ability

68
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,750
and won the gold medal for the men's 500-meter short track skating.

Next, we'll do a brief interview

73
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,600
with Dajing. Hi, Dajing.

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,190
- Hello.
- Welcome to our live interview.

75
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,800
Now, we want to ask Dajing, after winning the gold medal,

76
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,180
how are you feeling at this moment?

77

And I feel very fortunate.

80
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,400
Before, I thought a lot about gestures to do as I crossed the finish line, but I forgot all of them.

81
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,580
- You forgot all of them?
- Yes, all of them.
- You must really be too happy and excited.

82
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,330
Next, I want to ask Dajing, as the main strength of our Chinese speed skating team,

83
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,730
as a top skater,

84
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,850
what gave you the strength to make it to where you are today?

85
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,810
I wouldn't say I'm the top, but as an athlete, the most important thing is perseverance.

86
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,910
Every athlete will face obstacles, setbacks, and times of bewilderment.

87

During this time, be yourself and trust yourself

88

to fulfill your dream. In the end, you will stand on the award podium.

89
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,490
Yes, Dajing said it well. I believe that Dajing's success today

90
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,390
is definitely due to

91

If I remember correctly, you trained in speed skating

95

for around 8 years, right?

96

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,240
Master Tang, I'll just send you off here then.

153
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,800
If you have any pretty roommates then...

154
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,750
- Annoying!
- ...remember to introduce me to them!

155
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,210
Bye-bye.

156
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,930
This dorm is too nice, isn't it?

157
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,360
Master Tang! I missed you so much!

158
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,800
How is it? I specially came back early to decorate it for you.

159
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,490
Not bad. You've done a great job.

160
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,750
Do you like it?

161
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,050
Your taste is a bit too much, huh?

162
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,190
I have a heavy taste in things? Don't you think they're cute?

163
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,820
[Sterilization]
You're already studying up on veterinarian courses?

164
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,180
No, this is studying on male anatomy. It's just extracurricular reading for pure enjoyment.

165
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,850
Huan-huan, you really taught me what it means

166
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,390
that college would refresh my worldview, view of values, and view of life.

167
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,790
Are you scared of loving me now?

168
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,320
That's right! When I was coming in, I saw a club that was recruiting, so I signed up.

169
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,340
- You signed up? We'll be together. What club?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,230
On-Ice Club.

171
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,120
Don't worry. I, Master Tang, will never leave you. I'll take you with me wherever I go.

172
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,920
A beautiful college life starts with joining a club.

173
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:08,510
My idol. I hope that one day I can be like you and be a world-class hockey athlete.

174
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,440
And let more people know the strength of the Chinese Hockey Team.

175
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,350
Right now, they're savoring their time to practice.

176
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,540
- How are the team players for this season?
- Not bad.

177
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,310
Li Yubing?

178
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,330
Ice God, how come you're at LUU?

179
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,000
Of course, it's because I invited him. Xu Feng, let me introduce you.

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,780
This is Li Yubing, our club's most outstanding hockey athlete.

181
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,820
The current "Ice God," playing center forward, just like you did.

182
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,050
I don't dare to be called Ice God in front of Xu Feng.

183
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,340
He's the first person to be able to enter KHL (Kontinental Hockey League). The current celebrity athlete.

184
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,690
I've watched your games before. Your speed is fast and offense is sharp.

185
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,140
You're able to score without waiting for the opposing team to react. You're doing great.

186
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,960
I'll continue to work hard. Actually, you're my idol; my goal.

187
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,130
I hope to one day be like you and enter into KHL and bring honor back to the country.

188
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,900
He has ambition. But as a senior, I must remind you.

189
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,310
Dreams are always wonderful. But on the journey to fulfilling one's dreams,

190
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,510
it's arduous, perhaps even very cruel.

191
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,980
You won't shrink back, right?

192
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,820
Idol, back then you must have been like me.

193
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,860
Have you cowered back into fear?

194
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,560
In my dictionary, there's no such phrase as "shrinking back"!

195
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,130
Then we must be using the same dictionary.

196
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,390
Looking good. But you must remember these words you said to me today.

197
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,030
In the future, no matter what difficulties or setbacks,

198
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,800
don't shrink back, endure to the end, and then success will definitely come.

199
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,590
I will persevere to the end. And hopefully, follow your footsteps shortly and enter KHL.

200
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,630
Okay! I'll be waiting for you in KHL.

201
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,230
Okay now, I still have some things to discuss with Xu Feng. Let's talk later.

202
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,940
Okay.

203
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,610
Li Yubing, good luck.

204
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,360
Good luck, Ice God!

205
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,750
Umm, don't we have another roommate here in our dorm?

206
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh here? She's not back yet. Her name is Ye Liuying, majoring in philosophy.

207
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,830
Okay. I'll be going to take a shower, I smell awful.

208
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,070
Our dorm's showerhead broke. The dorm monitor said that they can only come and fix it tomorrow morning.

209
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,320
But I can't just be stinky the whole day, right?

210
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,300
I heard from our neighboring dorm that you can shower in our school's gym. Why don't you try there?

211
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,810
Gym? All right then.

212
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,580
You're a senior player here, as a junior in college, yet you're still so impetuous.

213
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,260
Guess who I just met?

214
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,110
Why'd you just leave and not care for me?

215
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,510
I saw my idol!

216
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,900
Your idol?

217
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,620
China's number one ice hockey player, Xu Feng?

218
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,160
- That's right.
- Who plays in KHL?

219
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,620
Why did he come to LUU? I want his autograph!

220
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,830
He left already. You just sit now.

221
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,730
I really hope one day I can play alongside him.

222
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,750
Oh right, Big Jiang.

223
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,780
I'm very sorry to say that I didn't find your tooth.

224
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,890
I found it. It was in his gum.

225
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,110
It hurts so bad.

226
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,050
Aren't I handsome?

227
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,640
Lose five more teeth and you'll be more handsome than famous hockey star Brian Boyle.

228
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,670
You can even go play in the NHL.

229
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,880
I say, are you really okay?

230
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,770
In order to save me... this is your second tooth, right?

231
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,220
Are you okay? The competition was over yet you went to throw a punch.

232
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,020
- Now you're hurt, huh.
- He's worse than me, I'm fine.

233
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,010
If you're fine, then so am I.

234
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,630
I still have to remind you, be careful. Don't have any teeth by the time Brother Wei gets back.

235
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,410
That can't do. I'm still waiting for Wei-wei to treat us for dinner. How can I eat without teeth?

236
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,080
I'm off.

237
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,720
- You're leaving me alone again? What are you up to now?
- Showering.

238
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,190
Hey! The lights aren't working there!

239
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,330
Today's been full of bad luck.

240
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,050
Hey, Bro, lend me your shampoo. I didn't bring any.

241
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,590
What's this?

242
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,060
Not soap. Shampoo.

243
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,100
Shampoo.

244
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,800
Hey, Bro. What's your major? You are showering really late at night.

245
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,500
Your shampoo smells really good.

246
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,200
It's like a girl's shampoo.

247
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,600
Which team are you on? We're both in sports. Do you have a problem digesting?

248
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
Want me to provide you with a nutritional meal plan?

249
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,500
Thanks!

250
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
Bro?

251
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Bro?

252
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,300
You don't even turn off the water, so wasteful.

253
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
[Tang Xue]

254
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,800
Master Tang, you showered really quickly. How was it?

255
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,800
It was pretty good. I am going to sleep now.

256
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,000
[Female Dormitory]

257
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,800
When I came back yesterday, you already

258
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,000
fell asleep. Since we will live together for a long period of time,

259
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,800
I feel like it is necessary for me to introduce myself.

260
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,900
Hi, my name is Tang Xue.

261
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,400
Hi, my name is Ye Liuying. My major is philosophy.

262
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,800
Are you from the sports major?

263
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
No, my...

264
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,500
major is Veterinary Medicine in the agricultural college.

265
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
A veterinarian?

266
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Democritus once said that humans are almost always

267
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,600
the followers of animals. When knitting, they learn from spiders.

268
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,500
When building, they learn from swallows.

269
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,400
When dealing with something in music, they learn from owls and swans.

270
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,700
P-Pretty good.

271
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
You carried a lot up here all by yourself.

272
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,200
How is that possible? A nice person brought it up here and I just picked it up.

273
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Can I ask a question?

274
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Definitely!

275
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,600
How come I can't meet a kind-hearted person?

276
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,900
Classmate, if you run into a guy outside,

277
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,500
it doesn't matter if he is tall, rich, and handsome or chubby and round,

278
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,800
if you call him "handsome boy,"

279
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,200
most of them will become a kind-hearted person. If you don't believe me, you can try it.

280
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,790
Handsome boy.

281
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Handsome boy?

282
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Wait! Master Tang,

283
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,220
what happened to you?

284
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,200
Did I do something wrong again?

285
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,000
No matter what I did wrong, I apologize beforehand.

286
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,700
You should just call me Xiao Liao or Xiao Yu.

287
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,790
If that doesn't do it, call me stupid.

288
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,200
Don't be like this, I'm really a bit scared.

289
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,710
Cut the nonsense. Add one more serving of breakfast.

290
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,800
Go to the front door of the Agricultural College.

291
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
- Breakfast.
- Thanks!

292
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,200
Your boyfriend?

293
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,600
Classmate, come over here.

294
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
- Me?
- Come. Come.

295
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,400
Look in my eyes.

296
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Am I blind?

297
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Master Tang, come.

298
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,600
Master Tang, is she your roommate?

299
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
What is your intent?

300
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
When she smiled earlier, my heart burst.

301
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
It's love at first sight!

302
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Friendly reminder:

303
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,000
she was reading an encyclopedia on male sterilization yesterday.

304
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,800
Huan-huan, it's time for class!

305
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,500
Thanks for your breakfast!

306
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,500
Male Sterilization Encyclopedia?

307
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,300
She's kind of dangerous, but she's cute and

308
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,000
youthful. I like it.

309
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,800
Manager Ma.

310
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,400
My Ice God.

311
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,200
Hurry, come over here.

312
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
You were looking for me?

313
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,600
Yes, I am picking out an assistant for you. I want to listen to your opinion.

314
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,400
I already said that I don't need one.

315
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,600
Just look at it for a second. I've been going through the applications for so long.

316
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,300
Just-Just five minutes.

317
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,200
This girl, I saw her in-person.

318
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,000
She looks really beautiful. Your mood just becomes better by looking at her.

319
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,600
Also, this one.

320
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,800
She knows martial arts. Later on, she can be used as half a bodyguard.

321
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,300
Okay.

322
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,700
This person is not good.

323
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,170
Oh, and also this one. Let me tell you.

324
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,800
Her major is nutrition. She is smart.

325
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,600
[Tang Xue]
In the future, we will have a menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

326
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
[Tang Xue]

327
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,000
It's her?!

328
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,900
I don't want to have anything to do with her for the rest of my life.

329
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,200
No.

330
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,500
This is a once in a lifetime chance.

331
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,900
I want her.

332
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,300
B-But, Tang Xue? Wait.

333
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,200
But she is in the veterinarian major. What can she help you with?

334
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,800
I want her to stir up my...

335
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
I never realized that before.

336
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,300
He is the legendary Hawkeye Zhuo.

337
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,700
Hello, everybody. I am your professor for veterinary medicine. My name is Zhuo Guoqiang.

338
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,800
This is your first course in college after military training.

339
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,700
I have a question for everybody. It is

340
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,000
why did you guys choose veterinary medicine as your major?

341
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,300
Why is he called Hawkeye?

342
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,000
I heard the upper class say that

343
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,300
he torments his students.

344
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,900
He takes attendance each period. You can't be tardy or skip class.

345
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,000
The tests are also very hard. Most important,

346
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
there is no cheating scenario where he can't catch. That's why he's called Hawkeye.

347
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Does he not know that "virtue is one foot tall, the devil ten foot?"
(T/N: idiom: it takes constant vigilance to stave off evil)

348
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,400
This student,

349
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,300
you have something to say, right? Please say it.

350
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,400
I was transferred here.

351
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,600
Oh. What was your dream before?

352
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,500
Do you want the truth or lie, Professor?

353
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,200
Of course the truth. Telling the truth is a virtue.

354
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,900
I wish that I don't have to go to classes, turn in homework, or take tests to graduate successfully.

355
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,700
You, sit down.

356
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,200
I even want to not teach and get my salary.

357
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,100
What's your name?

358
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,500
Tang Xue.

359
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,600
Okay, I'll remember it.

360
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,600
You will have to attend all my classes.

361
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,800
I will quiz you on the main points.

362
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,600
How about the student next to her?

363
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,100
Professor, my dream is to have whales and polar bears as my patients. I think that would be super cool.

364
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,700
Please sit.

365
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,900
If a person doesn't have a dream, it's like a walking corpse. You will not be passionate towards the major you are learning.

366
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,600
If you are not passionate enough, then it will be hard to achieve long-term persistence.

367
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,200
In the future, how hard you work has nothing to do with me.

368
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,200
But being responsible to the animals, I wish that

369
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,600
everybody will uphold an attitude in their hearts.

370
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,400
And that is passion.

371
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,100
You should also have a standard called "professionalism."

372
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,400
I will take attendance for every class.

373
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,800
If you skip class for 3 or more times, then it will be counted as not passing your final exam.

374
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,200
I will also have pop quizzes based on what we learn each week.

375
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,600
Do you guys understand?

376
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,800
Yes.

377
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,900
Okay, let's start the class.

378
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,800
Please open your books to page one, chapter one, and paragraph one.

379
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,300
[Passion]

380
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,700
Congratulations!

381
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,800
Originally, you should also be here.

382
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Short track speed skating to you is a career.

383
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,100
But to me, it can only be a hobby now.

384
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,900
[Passion]

385
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,230
Master Tang! Master Tang!

386
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,060
Master Tang!

387
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,640
Master Tang, let me tell you the latest news for LUU.

388
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,510
Yesterday, there was a female pervert who attacked the Ice God at night.

389
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,410
There's also a video.

390
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,220
Hey!

391
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,130
[Inside Story: Perverted Sasaeng Fan Waiting for Ice God]

392
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,510
So perverted.

393
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,650
Don't spread rumors.

394
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,920
Perhaps she was just a passerby.

395
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,810
How could that be possible? Why would a passerby

396
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,930
frantically run in the middle of the night, right?

397
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,010
Master Tang.

398
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,300
Didn't you go to the showers last night, too? Did you see the pervert?

399
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,940
I think I've seen someone who runs like that in the past.

400
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,850
I was in the female showers.

401
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,660
How many days have you been here and you know who it is?

402
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,360
Master Tang, who knows? This may really be a freshman like us.

403
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,250
Do you believe?

404
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,030
Seriously, look.

405
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,650
She really got into LUU.

406
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,540
It truly is enemies on a narrow road.
(T/N: idiom: an inevitable clash between enemies)

407
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,680
Let's go.

408
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,400
You don't feel well?

409
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,480
A... little bit.

410
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,160
She's trying to mimic how I walk.

411
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,890
What a laughingstock.

412
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,090
You cannot copy half of my elegance even if you learn for 500 years.

413
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:22,720
What's this situation now?

414
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,440
What are you doing?

415
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,290
Congratulations on being admitted to LUU's XDragons Club.

416
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,480
Please come report with your valid student ID to LUU's gym this afternoon.

417
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,690
I've been accepted.

418
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,950
I've been accepted!

419
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,600
Careful, careful, careful.

420
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,960
What did you get accepted in? You're so excited.

421
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,810
I am the manager here at XDragons Club.

422
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,850
My last name is Ma. You can call me Manager Ma.

423
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,780
I'll introduce them since you might not know them yet.

424
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,070
Last year, LUU and our XDragons Club

425
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,030
started a program that allowed for enterprise and higher education to collaborate here at the On-Ice Club.

426
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,560
The club includes the hockey team,

427
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,980
figure skating team, and short track speed skating team.

428
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,760
This time, we were recruiting for the athlete's manager position.

429
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,860
Most importantly, it's to take care of our hockey team's

430
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,980
top-rate star, Ice God.

431
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:26,150
I heard someone secretly saw him taking a shower.

432
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,430
Have you caught him?

433
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,960
Ice God has a lot of fans of every kind.

434
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,570
Also, Ice God didn't see clearly who it was so we're just going to let it go.

435
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,880
So, Manager Ma, there were so many applicants, why did you choose me?

436
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,060
It's because...

437
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,320
we thought that you were very suitable after a very extensive filtering process.

438
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,360
Uh, didn't you practice short track speed skating?

439
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,100
You're able to understand the habits of athletes better.

440
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,370
Did she sign yet?

441
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,760
Almost.

442
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,500
This is your labor contract. Take a look and then sign your name.

443
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,420
This is my ID.

444
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,990
Look at you! This girl is full of life.

445
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,460
Actually, this job is pretty simple.

446
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,120
You just have to help Ice God do various small tasks and arrange his daily schedule.

447
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,990
Of course, to put it simply, you represent our club

448
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,370
to bring warmth to Ice God.

449
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,200
Of course, because you are Ice God's assistant, so your hourly wage

450
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,310
is double that of other part-time work.

451
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,210
I will make him die of heat.
(T/N: her job is to bring him warmth from the club)

452
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,720
Y-You might not know Ice God.

453
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,680
He is a legendary person.

454
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,760
The biggest reason why our XDragons Club collaborated with LUU is because of him.

455
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,990
Male sports fans find his skills to be good.

456
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,610
Female fans find him to be handsome. School administrators

457
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,380
find him to bring honor to the school. The Chairman thinks he'll be the future Xu Feng.

458
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,350
And so, he really is a person who is loved by all, to the extent flowers bloom and tires burst when they see him.

459
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,630
Then he must really be served with the utmost respect as if he is your ancestor.

460
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,050
So many people have fought to become his assistant.

461
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,040
Actually, these last pages of the contract just talk about earthquakes,

462
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,790
tsunamis, etc., those unexpected circumstances that may come up. You know, it's super boring.

463
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,460
That's right. Is it really true that you can skate for free?

464
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,490
Of course.

465
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,250
Manager Ma,

466
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,030
I have two other friends

467
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,140
that also want to join our club.

468
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,330
Can you help out?

469
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,040
If they can ice skate,

470
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,440
then, of course, that's not a problem.

471
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,380
Thank you!

472
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,900
Ancestor, we'll be coming now!

473
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,180
Hello, I am Tang Xue.

474
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,170
You... are my new assistant?

475
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,640
Yes.

476
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,670
This person looks so familiar.

477
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,030
Li Yubing?

478
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,650
It's you, Li Yubing?

479
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,000
Li Yubing, what are you looking at?

480
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm not looking at anything.

481
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,630
Li Yubing.

482
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,560
Look at... this!

483
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,990
Look at this!

484
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,580
Li Yubing!

485
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,360
I threw it away already! See, there's nothing in my hands now!

486
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,300
Li Yubing!

487
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,160
Li Yubing! Stop running!

488
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,740
