[Episode 4]

18
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,880
How nice would it have been if I didn't give up?

19
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,090
Ice God.

20
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,920
- What's up?
- Are you tired? Have some breakfast.

21
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,230
Thank you. You came so early.

22
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,250
I promised Tang Xue that I'd be very dedicated, of course.

23
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,670
I just finished running, my mouth is a little dry. I won't eat it now. I'll eat it later.

24
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,790
Oh, I have water here, too.

25
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,110
How could the Ice God not have water?

26
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,130
Oh, by the way, can I ask you something?

27
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,730
Go ahead.

28
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,030
Didn't your cousin, Tang Xue, used to skate well?

29
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,840
Why is she here studying to be a veterinarian now?

30
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,990
Tang Xue...

31
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,650
Tang Xue is good at everything. She just lacks a little patience.

32
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,960
She does everything with three minutes of passion. She changes her mind all the time; no one can make sense of her.

33
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,720
But when she was little, she clearly skated very well.

34
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,800
Gradually, she skated less well.

35
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,690
Speaking of ice-skating, Ice God, I'm very interested in it now.

36
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,370
How about teaching me to skate when you have some time?

37
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,410
You want to ice skate?

38
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,290
The important thing about ice-skating is that you have to be willing to fall down. Are you willing?

39
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,870
- Willing to fall down?
- Yes.

40
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,200
Ice-skating is a very dangerous sport.

41
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,670
The first lesson has to be learning to fall.

42
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:48,020
Especially for a beginner, it's common to fall 90 to 100 times in a day.

43
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,380
Besides things like the arms and legs, even the face... for example,

44
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,660
the nose and chin... they're all easily bumped into.

45
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh right! I heard you are specializing in broadcasting. Could that affect your image?

46
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,440
If that's true, it probably doesn't suit me well.

47
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,890
True. Ineed, it doesn't really suit delicate young girls like you.

48
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,960
That's it. I still have to train. I'll be leaving.

49
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,070
Goodbye, Ice God.

50
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,300
Doing things with three minutes of passion... doesn't sound like her.

51
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,900
Bing-bing, did you finish your morning exercise?

52
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,620
I finished. You guys are early.

53
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,550
Big Jiang insisted on dragging me out for morning exercise.

54
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,900
I didn't even eat breakfast. Where do you get the energy for morning exercises?

55
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,990
Whose breakfast is this? It looks pretty good.

56
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,780
Is that yours? You're even going to eat it?

57
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,820
It's mine. That junior who's in broadcasting, Zhou Ran, brought it.

58
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,590
The Ice God is really an Ice God. Not the same as the others.

59
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,120
Every day, you have juniors bringing you breakfast.

60
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,510
Look at you. You know how to eat every day, but you don't even say thank you to Bing-bing.

61
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,280
Give me some.

62
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,830
This bread is really expensive.

63
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,560
Bing-bing, if you get treated like this, the two of us won't have to buy breakfast.

64
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,850
Fine. If you two like it, I'll get it every day for you. Okay?

65
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,470
If you're saying that,

66
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,830
you are really our brother.

67
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,130
How about this. From now on, Big Jiang, you go get breakfast for me every day.

68
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,930
I authorize all of it to you. Anyway, I don't want to see people I don't even know.

69
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,370
I will accomplish this mission.

70
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,400
Why are you just getting here?

71
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,490
So sorry. Let's walk and talk.

72
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,550
I think it's going to be too difficult to get into the same club as Master Tang.

73
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,660
You even have to get into the roller skating club first.

74
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,630
Aren't you the one that can't ice skate?

75
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,320
You sound as if you can ice skate.

76
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
So, we're really going to do what Master Tang said?

77
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,570
First, get used to roller skating; after that, getting on the ice should be a lot easier.

78
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,400
What's that called? It's called solving the problem using a different way.

79
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,490
I'll trust you this time.

80
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,710
It's the first time I'm putting on skates. Would I fall very pathetically?

81
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,350
What are you saying? My goodness! Here, let me.

82
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,330
What's difficult about this? Huh?

83
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,280
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

84
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,490
What are you doing? Come over here.

85
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,780
Huan-huan, wait for me. Huan-huan.

86
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,890
Huan-huan.

87
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,410
Here. Choose first. Which one do you want?

88
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,690
In theory, you're not Master Tang's style.

89
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,030
How did you become Master Tang's friend?

90
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,650
You now want to know how Master Tang subdued me?

91
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,170
Then, it has to start from high school.

92
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,030
These last few days when you haven't come, I've done something really stupid.

93
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,690
What is it?

94
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,360
The math teacher was checking our homework. I didn't do it. So I snuck under my desk.

95
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,710
- Guess what happened?
- What?

96
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,420
He called on me. I was so nervous. I banged my head on the desk.

97
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,010
You're so dumb.

98
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,450
You're laughing. If you laugh any more, believe it or not, I'll tell the teacher about your smoking.

99
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,410
You'd dare do that? If so, I'll light you and the whole class on fire.

100
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,340
Zhao Youde!

101
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,660
Can you guys...

102
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,450
not carry on a c-conversation d-during s-self-study?

103
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,600
Is it affecting your class study?

104
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,260
Say Li-Li-Li-Liao Zhenyu,

105
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,190
You can't even speak properly

106
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,360
and you want-want-want to talk to us?

107
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,860
This is our m-math self-study class, so I h-have to get involved.

108
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,090
If you g-guys want to eat s-sunflower seeds,

109
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,720
then g-go outside so that you d-don't interfere with us studying.

110
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,450
I'm telling you what if we're not-not-not going out?

111
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,160
What can you do about it?

112
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,740
Are you all right?

113
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,070
I know what you're going to say.

114
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,690
It's not your fault that you can't talk well,

115
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,600
but some people need to be taught a lesson if they can't talk well.

116
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,200
You have two choices right now. One, immediately apologize to Liao Zhenyu.

117
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,330
Two, don't think about talking well forever.

118
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,770
I was also wrong.

119
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,060
So sincere?

120
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,190
You don't have to be courteous with these people. Do your homework.

121
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,450
Our Master Tang is so cool.

122
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,580
Of course, this isn't the only thing where Master Tang is cool.

123
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,270
Later, she also introduced me to her mother who is a doctor.

124
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,100
With her mom's help, my stammer slowly went away.

125
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,830
See, if I don't say it now then who would know?

126
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,030
So from then on, I wanted to follow Master Tang.

127
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,320
Hence, I wanted to become a good doctor.

128
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,150
A good doctor who saves tens of thousands of underprivileged people.

129
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,270
Don't talk about me. What about you?

130
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,490
How did you get subdued by Master Tang?

131
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,030
Me? I have to start from military training.

132
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,390
Quickly. The drillmaster will be here soon.

133
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,950
Do you have everything?

134
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,990
Before we call role, I'm going to check the appearance of your clothing, headgear, and footwear.

135
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,810
If anyone doesn't meet the requirements, don't blame me for being impolite!

136
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,500
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

137
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,260
We trained for so long, my waist is becoming skinny from hard work.

138
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,390
That's great. I don't need to go on a diet.

139
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,460
Is my brain any good?

140
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,490
What do I do?

141
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,120
What about you?

142
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,340
Hurry! This is the last one.

143
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,020
Good. Stop.

144
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,960
Are you all right?

145
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,570
I'm fine. I have basic training skills.

146
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,260
Thanks. You still helped me at such a crucial time,

147
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,720
causing yourself to get punished.

148
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,000
It's my first offense.

149
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,530
It'll be fine. You've gotten it several times.

150
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,690
It wouldn't be frog jumps for you.

151
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,320
You'd get demerits. Then, who would eat meals with me?

152
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,010
What are you looking at?

153
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,330
Help me back to the Imperial Palace.
(T/N: speaking as if she's an emperor)

154
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,690
Okay.

155

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,890
- How about competing in acrobatics skating?
- No way.

312
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,960
We don't have a judge here. How could winners and losers be decided?

313
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Don't think I don't know that you have a guy who's a figure skating champion.

314
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,360
What's up? Have you come here to bully us non-professionals? What's with that?

315
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,390
Even though Yu Yan is a figure skating champion,

316
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,570
but he's also a non-professional. He roller-skates as a hobby.

317
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,430
How is that bullying?

318
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,860
Also, if it's not pattern skating, how will we compete?

319
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,760
Compete for speed.

320
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,130
Who's fast. Who's slow. Who wins. Who loses.

321
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,370
The public can be the audience and the judges. Clear at a glance.

322
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,730
Little girl, do you think I'm dumb?

323
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,860
Have you already brought in an outsider; waiting for me to enter a trap?

324
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,730
Whoever set the trap, they know in their own heart.

325
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,570
No one here is stupid.

326
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,890
This is my student ID.

327
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,880
Veterinarian major. The stamp can't be faked.

328
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,010
If you don't believe it, go check it out at admin.

329
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,510
What do you mean by this?

330
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,220
I'll compete against you representing LUU.

331
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,110
You competing against me in speed skating?

332
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,760
What's wrong? Does this work, Club President?

333
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,590
Can you do it?

334
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,380
How can that work? Compete against you? It would be a one-sided fight.

335
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,980
Find a male to compete. It's speed skating. Whoever is afraid of it is a coward.

336
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,480
You shouldn't be so overconfident.

337
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,110
Talk after you win against me, a girl.

338
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,110
Club President Li, you're quite crafty.

339
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,360
It's so embarrassing to have fallen as far as this, hiding behind a young girl.

340
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,290
It's not glorious, but it is outstanding. You guys...

341
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,820
Since it's like this... fine.

342
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,780
The loser has to be a streaker.
(T/N: dash naked in public)

343
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,370
Tang Xue, don't.

344
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,730
What do you think, little sister? Do you dare?

345
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,870
- Are you serious?
-Of course.

346
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,950
Okay. I admire your guts. If you're capable, don't wear your underpants.

347
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,740
Ten loops.

348
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,790
- No way!
- Wow!

349
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,490
I'll do it.

350
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,670
I'll compete against you for this competition.

351
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,060
- Don't lose face for LUU.
- I'll personally turn him into a streaker.

352
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,970
That's enough. Did you forget that you're supposed to listen to me now?

353
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,830
The hero saving the beautiful maiden, right?

354
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,850
You're overthinking it. I'm telling you! If you really lose, how will this end?

355
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,120
Tang Xue, how certain are you?

356
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,240
Don't worry, I won't lose.

357
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,220
Then don't be nervous. I'll accompany you.

358
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,540
Wait and watch, Li Yubing.

359
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,210
Let's go.

360
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,260
Li Yubing, I always thought you were hostile to our Master Tang.

361
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,370
But at the crucial moment, you did the right thing.

362
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
I'm willing to bring you breakfast.

363
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,850
I'm not willing.

364
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,840
Ready...

365
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,050
Let's go!

366
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,370
Tang Xue, don't think about controlling the ice skating blades.

367
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,380
You and the blades are one.

368
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,230
What you need to control is your own body. This way you can skate even faster.

369
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,010
Let's go!

370
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,580
Don't look at your opponents. Don't think about them. Look straight ahead. Look at the finish line!

371
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm done for.

372
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,750
You did great, Tang Xue. If you keep improving at this rate,

373
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,540
you can definitely join the national team in the future!

374
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,710
Good job!

375
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,050
Thank you.

376
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,650
In a newbie 'chicken pecking' match like this, you made it look like an Olympic race.

377
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,190
Li Yubing, what are you saying? Are you calling our Master Tang a chicken?

378
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,050
Don't talk nonsense. He was talking about a match between newbies. The main point was the first word.

379
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,150
Oh, so it was about being a noob.

380
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,430
Make some room.

381
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,360
Tang Xue, these two were planning to escape. I dragged them back here.

382
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,640
What should we do with them?

383
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,730
Go streaking! Weren't you so great just now? Strip!

384
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,650
Streak!

385
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,050
Streak!

386
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,670
Streak!

387
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,350
Streak!

388
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,230
Who are you?

389
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,510
An autobot.

390
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,940
- Strip!
- Yes!

391
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,720
Streak!

392
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,190
Enough, enough!

393
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,960
If we really make you streak in LUU, won't it look like we're bullying non-LUU students?

394
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,350
Are we a place that bullies people?

395
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,850
No!

396
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,990
Remember, do not make claims outside from now on.

397
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,500
Remember there is always someone better.

398
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,120
LUU Inline skating club, you win.

399
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,200
Even a vet can skate this well!

400
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,410
You guys have hidden talents.

401
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,360
You flatter us. It takes one to know one.

402
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,420
We learn from each other.

403
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,580
Okay, then you guys can leave. We'll let you off.

404
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,660
- Scatter.
 - Bye.

405
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,510
Everyone, Red Coral Hotel at the back entrance of the school tomorrow evening.

406
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,930
We'll be holding a celebratory meal for our Autobot. All are welcomed.

407
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,240
- Thank you, Club President!
- Thank you, Club President!

408
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,200
Let's go. Yu Yan.

409
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,750
Let's go.

410
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,760
Master Tang, I have plans. I'll have to leave first.

411
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,050
I'll accompany her.

412
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,710
Why don't you ice skate anymore?

413
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,980
That's none of your business.

414
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,460
At the time, our Master Tang was behind that "Fried Hair"

415
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,750
by half a lap!

416
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,400
Xiao Liao and I thought that it was over back then.

417
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,050
- The streaking was a done deal.
- What happened next?

418
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,580
Then, she started skating faster and faster. Faster and faster.

419
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,700
- Guess what happened.
- What happened?

420
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,960
Near the finish line, Master Tang overtook him!

421
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,310
Back then, the whole place was heated. She was so cool!

422
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,370
Tang Xue, you're amazing!

423
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,230
Master Tang, how did you know we should compete for speed with them?

424
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,240
Actually, roller skating is a sport that was developed from ice skating.

425
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,110
Due to the issues of friction of the skates,

426
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,760
as well as the distribution of tension, in figure roller skating and figure skating,

427
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,380
they cannot fully replace each other. Even if Club President Li got Yu Yan,

428
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,420
it wouldn't really help.

429
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,030
I've looked up this club.

430
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,320
Their main talents lie in acrobatics roller skating. No one focussed on speed skating.

431
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,320
But speed ice skating and speed roller skating, these sports are highly similar.

432
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,870
If one can skate fast on the ice,

433
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,740
then one can also skate fast on the ground.

434
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,440
Just like me.

435
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,530
I trained professionally for eight years in short track speed skating.

436
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,430
If it wasn't for halting training for two years, I could have gained two laps on them.

437
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,400
Does no one want to hear the champion speak?

438
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,090
We're listening!

439
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,800
Keep boasting. Oh no, no... Keep talking!

440
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,610
- I'm not playing anymore.
- I'm tired.

441
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,840
You guys keep boasting about me. I'm listening.

442
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,950
Tang Xue, your life lacks compliments. I've foretold it.

443
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,920
Master Tang, you were too cool on the tracks.

444
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,760
Please go into more detail.

445
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,520
It's like how you're normally a broken bicycle,

446
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,550
but on the tracks, you're like a Ferrari.

447
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,010
[Childhood story]

448
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,750
Li Yubing, help me sharpen one as well.

449
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,570
Oh.

450
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,360
What's this?

451
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,520
Armor Hero stickers.

452
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,400
Then I'll help you stick it on.

453
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,230
Up to you.

454
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,180
Darling, how was today?

455
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,420
It was okay.

456
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,690
What's wrong?

457
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,700
My deskmate... she's too dumb.

458
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:29,240
How can you say that about your classmate. Kindness is the most important trait of a person.

459
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,580
You can't complain just because you think a classmate is dumb.

460
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,950
Doing that is very narrow-minded. Do you understand?

461
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,680
- Understood.
- Very good.

462
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,340
Actually... Tang Xue is quite cute.

463
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,500
She's not cute at all.

464
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,730
You two are childhood friends. You are both little now.
(T/N: can also be interpreted as childhood sweethearts)

465
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,440
When you grow up, you'll understand how this is precious.

466
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,320
Mom, what does it mean to be childhood friends?

467
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,930
It means that two people have grown up together.

468
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,280
Just like you and Tang Xue.

469
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,880
That's not a good term!

470
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,790
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

471
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:37,200
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

472
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,780
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

473
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:50,060
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

474
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,260
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

475
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:03,570
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

476
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:10,190
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I
couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

477
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,950
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

478
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,960
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

479
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,290
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

480
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,200
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

481
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,170
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

482
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:38,600
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

483
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:44,940
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

484
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:51,550
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

485
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:57,890
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

486
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:03,950

you traveling ♫

490
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:30,170

491
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:37,190
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

492
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:43,370
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

493
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:50,850
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

494
