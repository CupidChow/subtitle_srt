[Episode 35]

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,910
I'm very content now.

19
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,460
No matter how accomplished we are in the future, as long as we are together and work hard,

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,020
I'm very happy.

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,210
And I feel like there are no better boyfriends than you in this world.

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,470
You treat me like a princess, then you are my little prince.

23
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,210
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

25
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,230
- What?
- I'm fine, really.

26
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,800
Let me see. What's wrong? Why are you crying?

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,290
I'm fine. I'm just very touched.

28
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,930
Aren't you being silly? Even if you cry, you don't have to be like this.

29
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,130
Huan-huan.

30
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,600
Yes?

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,630
Let's never separate, okay? Let's not be like Master Tang and Li Yubing.

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,250
We'll never separate.

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,540
Okay. We won't ever separate.

34
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,860
Huan-huan, say, when we made that bet back then,

35
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,510
no one won.

36
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,680
We both won.

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,860
Only the two of us won.

38
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,390
We still need to thank Master Tang and Li Yubing.

39
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,290
We should try to think up some way to help them.

40
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,500
How about telling her about the matter of Li Yubing getting hurt?

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,370
Master Tang surely wouldn't be able to bear it.

42
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,390
There's no saying how much they care about one another; then, the problem is solved.

43
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,290
I've called Master Tang so many times. Her phone is always turned off.

44
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,560
I think that this break up has been a really big blow to her.

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,180
Besides, this is a crucial time for her regarding getting onto the national team.

46
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,800
Getting mixed up in this matter at this time might disrupt her training. That's not a good idea.

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,820
That's true. We need to take our time with this.

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,210
Master Tang? Let her get onto the National Team first and then we'll talk about it.

49
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,900
Li Yubing is an iceblock. He won't be able to find a girl anytime soon.

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,750
He dares? I'm telling you. You need to keep an eye on him.

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,160
No one can steal Li Yubing away.

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,870
That's exactly right.

53
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,350
Whoever dares to pursue him or if he tries to find another girlfriend, I'll break his legs first.

54
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,830
You're so awesome.

55
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,510
Hey, Huan-huan. The two of us shouldn't always be talking about the problems of others. Right?

56
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,980
It's our 180th day anniversary. Shouldn't the two of us...

57
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,260
What?

58
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,870
Uh...

59
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,480
What are you doing?

60
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,810
Close your eyes.

61
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,730
No way. I...

62
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,760
I was wondering why it started to prick when kissing! I thought you'd grown whiskers.

63
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,860
Okay, fine. Xia Menghuan, you're going to mess with me, huh?

64
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,460
Li Yubing, do you not trust her;

65
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,720
or not trust yourself?

66
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,670
What's wrong? Missing her?

67
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,620
If so, just give her a call.

68
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,650
Look at you. Rushing out like the hero to rescue the maiden before the competition...

69
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,500
such profound love.

70

- Go away.

have you and Tang Xue really broken up?

74

Yes.

75
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,040
This is what I think, I will support you no matter who you like.

76
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,350
But if you and Tang Xue

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,590
really have no future, shouldn't you consider other girls?

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,090

We still have quite a few more competitions.

82
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,530
Right now, it's the most critical period for the XDragons' championship.

83
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,870
This is our primary mission. Everything else

84
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,710
let it happen naturally.

Wei-wei, one day, I will tell you again, face-to-face.

As Jiang Shijia, I'll hug you tight.

89

So you're saying... If you told him,

90
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,320
you two wouldn't even be able to stay as friends?

Don't confine yourself by only seeing the scenery that is in front of your eyes.

93
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,000
If you turn around, you might find something different.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,190
Don't feel burdened by the things I did.

95
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,450
I just hope you are happy every day, that's enough for me.

But I'm starting to waver lately.

97
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,350
I'm super afraid that once I let go, you will fly away.

98
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,160
Even if you don't believe me, then at least, you should believe in yourself. Right?

99
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,070
You are the Ice God. Who is willing to fly away?

100
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,780
Dog, you're so heartless. Why didn't you come to see me before I left?

101
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,280
Maybe he was delayed by something.

You have to choose for yourself.

It's not because of you but for myself.

In the past, I didn't know what the meaning of me doing figure skating really was.

why would it keep climbing upwards?

In the eyes of mankind, it makes no sense doing that.

147

But maybe for the snail,

148

it just wants to climb to the top

00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,730
are like a veil

161
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,780
that covered my original intention.

162
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,480
So tight that even I forgot

163
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,650
how much I loved figure skating in the first place.

164
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,580
You've grown up.

165
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,110
From now on, you make the decisions for your life.

166
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,270
I promise you, no matter what choice you make,

167
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,530
I will never interfere.

168
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,730
They did it on purpose. What's this nonsense?

169
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,000
XDragons captain, Li Yubing, delivered an excellent pass one second before the game ended.

170
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,470
Jiang Shijia scored! XDragons won! Li Yubing fell all of a sudden.

171
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,020
They truly are Black Scorpions. Such brutes. Right, Bing-bing?

172
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,330
Did we wake you, Bing-bing?

173
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,860
You'll catch a cold if you sleep here. Go and nap in the dorm.

174
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,050
We have training later, right?

175
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,890
I'll ask for a leave for you. You were just hurt and need rest.

176
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,580
The doctor said I'm fine. I'm a strong man.

177
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,300
Let's go. Come back and practice after we eat.

178
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,450
- Bing-bing, don't be so harsh on yourself.
- Let's go.

179
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,390
Isn't it Yu Yan? You've spent a long time training abroad.

180
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,390
We were thinking you must have decided to stay in Canada forever.

181
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,140
I'm back.

182
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,270
Coach Jin.

183
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,240
Yu Yan?

184
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,080
How are you?

185
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,700
Your mom said you are recovering well.

186
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm fine. Thanks for covering for me.

187
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,580
They all thought I went training abroad.

188
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,690
To be honest, I didn't know what I could do for you.

189
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,240
Anyway, if I didn't force you in training, you...

190
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,690
I'm not a good coach.

191
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,760
I'm not a good team player either.

192
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,650
I caused a lot of trouble for everyone.

193
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,660
Coach Jin, I want to continue training with you.

194
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,410
Coach Jin.

195
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,070
Are you willing to help me get a fresh start?

196
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,950
They're so not human, I'm telling you.

197
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,300
After running 15,000 meters, they still can chat as usual. I can't even do that after running 10,000 meters.

198
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,050
Especially on the ice.

199
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,640
They're so fast and steady at the bend.

200
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,060
And pressuring me on the track. I couldn't find room to speed up.

201
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,070
Fair enough.

202
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,580
Those that can get in here

203
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,100
are all pretty good.

204
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,050
This fragrance...

205
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,230
I burned some incense to relax.

206
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,410
It smells like bluemink.

207
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,390
My grandma used to plant them.

208
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,480
Really?

209
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,740
Do you miss her?

210
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,590
Maybe.

211
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,920
How are you guys so close?

212
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,610
She raised me.

213
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,990
After my younger brother was born,

214
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,700
I was sent to live with my grandma in our hometown.

215
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,320
I think grandma

216
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,700
is the one who loves me the most in this world.

217
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,100
Sorry.

218
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,290
At that time...

219
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,320
This is also pretty good.

220
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,390
I shouldn't have treated you like that the other day.

221
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,250
Maybe I just thought

222
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,960
I let her down too much.

223
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,970
Before she passed,

224
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,480
I was very carefree and lived every day with no worries.

225
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,810
Until she passed away,

226
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,080
the moment I said goodbye to her at the hospital,

227
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,460
I suddenly realized that

228
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,100
the person that cares for me the most in this world

229
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,660
just left me forever.

230
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,110
I'll never see her again.

231
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,630
So the only thing I can do now is to wear the national team uniform

232
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,430
and let her see me.

233
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,820
She must be super proud

234
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,990
if she knows you are working so hard.

235
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,630
I didn't expect to talk about this with you.

236
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,530
You have to know that Master Tang's brilliance illuminates everything.

237
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,350
There's one opening left in my posse. Want it?

238
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,680
No. I'm the ring leader.

239
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,470
I heard that you've been hanging out with a girl lately.

240
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,000
Why haven't I heard of it?

241
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,420
Maybe, they made a mistake.

242
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,750
Now since you and our Master Tang have broken up...

243
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,280
Aren't you going to find another girlfriend?

244
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,490
Did Tang Xue tell you to ask?

245
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,070
No, no, no. Her phone has been off all this time.

246
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,630
I can't even get a hold of her.

247
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,850
Actually, it's Huan-huan that is making me ask.

248
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,830
Body fat, body weight, physical fitness are all normal.

249
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,000
Grip and lifting strength are better than before. Not bad.

250
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,000
Thanks.

251
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,230
What's wrong?

252
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,420
Not a big deal. I sometimes feel dizzy these days.

253
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,250
Dizzy?

254
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,250
Li Yubing, though we didn't find anything abnormal last time,

255
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,430
I personally recommend you to do another checkup at the hospital.

256
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll go after the tournament.

257
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,030
Still waiting? You'll be more at ease if you do the check-up earlier.

258
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,000
It's fine. The tournament is almost over. I don't want to leave any regrets.

259
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,730
No worries.

260
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,350
Li Yubing.

261
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,530
Did you really break up with Tang Xue?

262
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,720
If she has someone else in her heart,

263
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,830
what can I do?

264
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,480
Someone else?

265
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,430
Open your right hand a bit more. Here, lift your head.

266
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,210
Good. Very good.

267
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,920
I think the movement just now should be started a bit faster.

268
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,650
It'd be better.

269
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,510
No problem. What's wrong with your shoulder?

270
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,750
Nothing.

271
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,650
Take a break.

272
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,810
Haste makes waste. Come here.

273
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,060
- Why don't you have the team doctor check on it?
- It's fine.

274
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,340
Don't hide it.

275
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,680
Hey!

276
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,610
Why did he leave after seeing me?

277
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,700
Keep an eye on it.

278
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,210
Coach, how did we do?

279
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,340
How did I do?

280
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,820
All right. Don't be anxious. This is just the result of one test.

281
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,090
At the end of this month, we'll summarize everyone's performance

282
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,670
and have a comprehensive result. Okay?

283
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,810
- Okay. Thank you.
- Rest well.

284
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,930
Coach.

285
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,320
What is it?

286
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,690
Did Yuewei and I make the top eight?

287
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,970
Zhang Yuewei made it. You...

288
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,070
You still have a little bit of time. It's possible.

289
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,030
Keep working on it.

290
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,600
You have to know, only the best team member

291
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,740
can represent the Chinese team to stand on the starting line of short track speed skating.

292
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,090
Good luck.

293
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,310
What's the matter?

294
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,930
Congrats. You made the Top 8.

295
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,450
Really?

296
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,130
What about you?

297
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,380
I don't even know if I can stay.

298
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
Are you giving up again?

299
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,480
I've tried my best.

300
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,630
Do you remember back then when we

301
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,460
made a bet whether you could join the school team?

302
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,600
At that time, you were...

303
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,190
you were such a noob. Why were you so confident to make the bet?

304
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,210
That's nothing. I already made the bet.

305
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,190
I couldn't back out. So I just forced myself.

306
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,920
What about now?

307
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,300
Now that you're in LUU's speed skating team, you have an escape route.

308
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,130
Do you think your efforts right now are still as relentless as before

309
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,230
and you're doing your best?

310
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,920
I think the you back then was cuter.

311
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,620
I'm afraid of disappointing them.

312
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,990
I'm actually the same.

313
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,250
Stop thinking about it. You'll definitely stay.

314
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,870
I support you.

315
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,190
I have to stay.

316
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,640
So cute.

317
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,460
Xiao Yuyan.

318
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,210
Liao Zhenyu.

319
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,570
Long time no see. How have you been?

320
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,820
Very good. You are so hardworking. Back to training right away.

321
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,230
Let me check up on you.

322
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,300
Check up?

323
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,940
You probably don't know yet.

324
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,180
I'm the team doctor's assistant.

325
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,360
Coach Jin wants me to check on your shoulder.

326
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
It just feels stiff. Not a big deal.

327
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,580
That won't do.

328
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,780
Coach Jin deliberately asked me to check on you.

329
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,440
Coach Jin right now is likely possessed by Coach Chu.

330
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,970
He's super careful. I can't afford to offend him.

331
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,370
You know what he's like now? Like a mom!

332
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,930
Here, lift up.

333
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,550
Let me know when it hurts. Are you okay?

334
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,850
It hurts.

335
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,470
It's fine. It's not a big problem.

336
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,220
It should just be a muscle strain. I'll massage it a bit.

337
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,650
Apply hot compress when you get home. You'll be fine in a few days. I'll massage it.

338
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,380
Are Tang Xue and Li Yubing okay these days?

339
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,220
They broke up. You didn't know?

340
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,230
Why?

341
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,570
I didn't hear there was any big reason. Come on, turn around.

342
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,390
I think it was because Tang Xue stood him up a few times.

343
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,520
But I don't think it was as serious to break up. Look at it now.

344
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,140
Tang Xue is in intensive training and Li Yubing is competing for the championship.

345
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,360
We can't even help nor do we know what they want to do.

346
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,300
Did Li Yubing bring it up?

347
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,960
I think so. Li Yubing told me

348
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,790
the person in Tang Xue's heart isn't him.

349
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,320
Don't you think Li Yubing is stupid?

350
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,000
If he's not the one in Master Tang's heart, then who is?

351
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,420
He's turned stupid from playing too much hockey. I think the two of them definitely have some misunderstandings.

352
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,970
Once they're done and come back, they meet and explain,

353
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,490
this misunderstanding will be resolved and it'll be fine.

354
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,160
Remember to apply heat compression when you get home.

355
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,060
Yesterday,

356
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,430
I was really powerless, you know?

357
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,530
Hey, nephew.

358
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,530
Is Li Yubing here?

359
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,860
Yeah, he's inside.

360
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,950
Don't! Don't!

361
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,730
Something serious is happening. Let's go and have a look.

362
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,770
Hey!

363
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,020
Where are you?

364
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,590
Are you still with Old Ye and Xia Menghuan?

365
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, what's the matter?

366
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,120
Figure skating's locker room isn't here.

367
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,090
I'm here for you.

368
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,680
Li Yubing, did you break up with Tang Xue?

369
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,700
You won.

370
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,840
Because of me?

371
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,040
- Move.
- No.

372
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,220
In the past, Tang Xue was with me.

373
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,490
That's between you two. I'm not interested in listening.

374
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,480
It's because I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder so she came to help me.

375
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,690
My mom went to find Tang Xue, hoping she can help me get out of it.

376
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,740
My mom was worried people would talk about me so she asked Tang Xue to keep it a secret.

377
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,200
She didn't tell you because she promised my mom.

378
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,870
Then you and her...

379
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,850
We are not what you think.

380
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,730
Since the very beginning, she's only had you in her heart.

381
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,870
All that she did was just to help me.

382
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,150
Although I also like her,

383
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,480
she only likes you.

384
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,440
Since she's made her choice, I will wish her the best.

385
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,540
But with Tang Xue's temper,

386
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,340
she probably won't forgive me.

387
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,900
Since you've decided to give up, I'll go pursue her.

388
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,680
No way.

389
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,240
Then be nice to her. Don't make her sad.

390
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,180
How did you get sick?

391
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,380
Maybe because I became too fixated.

392
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,210
But I'm quite grateful for this illness.

393
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,930
I figured out who I am and what I want.

394
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,200
The process was painful but it allowed me to transform.

395
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,280
But didn't your mom not want no one else to know about this?

396
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,470
Tang Xue has helped me so much. If it wasn't for her,

397
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,030
I wouldn't be able to stand here like this.

398
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,790
If it was because of me causing you guys to break up,

399
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,090
I wouldn't be able to stand that.

406

We just heard a little.

But Big Jiang said we didn't hear anything.

408

No, the door is soundproof. I guess Fatty didn't hear anything.

Oh right. I asked you to keep an eye on Li Yubing for Master Tang. Did you do it?

Don't worry, I've tested him already. There definitely isn't anyone.

00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,800
So it's my fault?

482
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,600
What about Ma Juan and Li Li. Their passes are like drifting. Who can catch them?

483
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,200
You are complaining. It's your fault.

484
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,900
- You do it if you're so good.
- I was guarding the goal so well!

485
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,120
What's wrong with me?

486
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,100
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

487
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:32,500
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

488
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,100
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

489
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:45,400
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

490
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,600
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

491
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:59,000
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

492
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,500
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

493
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,300
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

494
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,300
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

495
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,600
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

496
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,500
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

497
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:27,500
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

498
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:34,000
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

499
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,400
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

500
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,900
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

501
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:53,300
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

504
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,400

believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

505
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,400
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

506
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,600
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

507
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:32,600
