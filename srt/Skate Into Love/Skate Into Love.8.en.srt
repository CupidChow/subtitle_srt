Bian Cheng. Come, sit.

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,330
A few days ago, we discussed going to LUU and doing an observation project. What are your thoughts?

24
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,600
I came to report back to you about this as well.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,720
Last year, LUU introduced a new model for a school-run enterprise collaboration.

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,990
With support from society, they created a new ice hockey club.

27
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,760
They also competed in the National University Hockey Tournament.

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,460
In the nation, they are second to none and became a forerunner.

29
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,150
In addition, they've created quite a sensation in the educational circles.

30
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,050
I've already contacted LUU. Tomorrow, I'll go watch the XDragons game

31
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,890
so I can understand the situation better. I plan to do a series of reports after that.

32
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,530
Very good. Bian Cheng, as the top student in the journalism department,

33
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,470
you can't let down the professors' expectations of you.

34
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,970
I trust you to do this report well.

35
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,230
It will help MU develop it's thinking.
(MU: Minghua University)

36
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,230
It is very meaningful and important.

37
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,430
I can do it.

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,880
Dean, if you have time tomorrow, we can go watch the game together.

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,500
Sounds good.

40
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,410
Gather around!

41
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,740
Come on. Huddle together.

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,190
Tomorrow is our game with the Lightning team.

43
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,120
Today, we'll end practice early so everyone can rest up.

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,740
Tomorrow's game is crucial.

45
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,680
It will determine whether our team will be in the top four.

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,690
The Lightning team's strength is very apparent.

47
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,030
Their strength is that all their players are tall and strong.

48
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,890
But their skill is not better than ours.

49
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,880
So if you guys want to win,

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,030
you have to look even stronger on the rink.

- Understood!

Don't be afraid, okay? Just play at your usual level.

- Okay, is everyone confident?
- Yes.

- Say it louder. Are you confident?
- Yes!

Okay, great.

Think about that bravest person.

You say this before every game. Aren't you tired of it?

I heard that you are under the weather these days.

72
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,080
I made you a birds' nest soup and added extra red dates in it.

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,600

76
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,640
don't we also act as fathers and mothers? Yu Yan has to train so hard.

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,010
I brewed him some tonics; build up his health.

78

Look. We thought of the same thing.

79

As coaches, we just have the life of caring for others.

80

My hockey team works so hard, so I turned on the stove and made them something.

81
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,260
That's what I admire about your personality. All this comes so naturally to you.

82
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,660
You have such a large hockey team. And you only made this much? Is the stove in your house that small?

83
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,960
Coach Jin, you have to ruin everything, don't you?

84
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,180
Don't think I don't know what you have in there. Soup for Yu Yan? You have such a glib tongue.

85
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,640
I have a glib tongue. Aren't you talking the same nonsense?

86
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm telling you. Let go of your illusions. What was between you and Xiao Xia is in the past.

87
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,260
Even so, it's more than you. Do you even have a past with her? Where is your past?

88
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,250
If it weren't for my oversight, would I be letting you get in quicker than me?

89
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,030
Further, you two are divorced. What does this show?
It shows that I have a second chance from fate.

90
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,120
In addition, Xiao Xia doesn't like your style anymore.

91
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,650
Do you know what Xiao Xia likes? Xiao Xia likes the scholarly and refined but not lacking intensity; a little wildness that also has some gentleness.

92
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,030
This type. Someone involved in figure skating is not merely an athlete.

When we're done with classes, come with me to go shopping. I'll buy you a skirt.

107

Can you buy me a skirt that is XXXXXS in size so it'll squeeze me to death and then it'll just bust open,

108
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,740

Can you be serious for a second?

110

Does he have something up his sleeve again?

But he already gave me the money. What other schemes can he have?

Using philosophy, cool relations, in the beginning, can make the later stages

"Love... is a gentle blossom. But it can also prick your hands like thorns.

143

Love is an adorable tyranny. Some sweethearts are willing to suffer its torment.

144
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,470
Love doesn't need a go-between for needless words. It completely relies on tacit understandings.

145
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,990
In love and war, naturally, you gain the initiative by striking first."

[The 5th National University Hockey Tournament]

157
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,300
Dean Wang, look. This is the new ice rink for the XDragons Team.

158
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,700
All of our equipment, including our on-ice technology, are the most advanced ones in the world.

159
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Including all our equipment technology on the second floor.

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,100
He's fierce.

162
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
I can handle it.

163
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,190
Li Yubing! Li Yubing! Li Yubing!

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Not bad, pretty good.

165
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,000
Be cautious and very careful.

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,600
Professors, the one with No. 19 uniform in the rink,

167
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
this is our XDragon Team hockey star, Li Yubing.

168

Let's go, Li Yubing! Let's go, Li Yubing!

Let's go, Li Yubing! Let's go, Li Yubing!

[XDragons: 2; Lightning: 3]

172
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
These people are crazy.

173
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,400
Don't be a coward.

174
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,800
Come on everyone, cheer up!

175
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,400
It's only half-time. Here.

176
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,600
Let me add some energy for you guys.

177
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Old Xu, why are we eating at this time? You eat them, we won't eat.

178
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,700
What are you thinking? I won't even give them to you if you want to eat.

179
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,600
Let me tell you guys.

180
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
For the first half, our problem was mainly passing the puck at the wrong place.

181
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,500
The defense wasn't done well. That's why it's easy for you to fall into the opponent's traps. Here.

182
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,200
When the forward sees that our team has the puck, you have to be careful and not be offside.

183
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,000
Once you're in the offensive zone, be prepared to pass at any time.

184
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,800
If you can't score on the first try, be sure to follow up immediately.

185
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,100
Defense, pay attention to the center forward of the opposite team.

186
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,600
Other team members, watch out for the corresponding players' locations.

187
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,900
When you go on the offense, you need to place the puck behind the blue line.

188
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,300
The wingman can then find an opportunity to pass it backward.

189
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,700
Shoot at the first opportunity; don't hesitate.

190
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,800
Do these right, we can definitely win this game.

191
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Do you all have confidence?

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,300
- Yes!
- Okay.

193

Okay.

198

The third period begins now. We can see all the athletes returning to the rink to warm up.

199
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,100
The momentum of both teams has already sparked a fierce flame.

200
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Li Yubing, your performance in the first half of the game was just so-so.

202
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,400
Not talking? Talking doesn't require energy.

203
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
This is a hockey game, not doing a stand-up comedy show.

204
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Fine. Friendly reminder, we'll be even more fierce.

205
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Be careful not to get hurt.

206
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Imposing manner. Think of the one who is the bravest.

207
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,710
You can try.

208
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
You can try.

209
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Okay, the teams are preparing for the face-off. In the first two periods, XDragons is behind with a score of 2 to 3.

210
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,800
Let's see how the XDragons will be in this last period.

211
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Okay, it begins!

212
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,900
XDragons gets the puck first.

213
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,100
Number 19, Li Yubing passed the blue line.

214
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,000
He passed the puck!

215
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Jiang Shijia hits the puck behind the goal.

216
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,500
Li Yubing quickly follows up, Lightning's defense is in danger.

217
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,600
Li Yubing makes a quick turn to avoid the opponent and brings the puck into the goal!

218
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,900
That was a beautiful move!

219
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,000
It looks like XDragons made a few adjustments after the first two periods.

220
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,600
The so-called Ice God, Li Yubing, is also starting to work hard.

221
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,400
Let's see if XDragons can continue this condition until the very end.

222
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Okay, we're back on the ice with the two teams facing off.

223
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,200
The face-off players are XDragon's #19 Li Yubing

224
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,300
and Lightning's #55 Liu Mingwei.

225
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Lightning gets the puck, good! Passes the puck, Wang Xiaodi is on the offense.

226
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,100
Jiang Shijia intercepts and knocks the player outside the wall.

227
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Jiang Shijia was also knocked out. The referee has not blown the whistle so the game continues.

228
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,400
This is way too intense. Lightning continues their offense.

229

Shoot!

230
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,700
Such as pity.

231
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,000
Li Yubing gets the puck and prepares for a rebound.

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
He passed the blue line and passed the puck.

233
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,900
His teammates assist and continue the offense.

234

Beautiful! Goal!

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,900
At such a crucial moment for the offense,

241
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,800
XDragons Li Yubing has eliminated the opponent.

242

They are the winners of this game!

243
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,900
Li Yubing has indeed lived up to our expectations. Right when the game was about to end,

244
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,800
a beautiful turn broke through the opponent's defense

245
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,400
and scored a goal. It was amazing!

246
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you, everyone.

247
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,700
Thank you to the XDragons for an entire season of hard work.

248

249
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,300
We'll see you again next year.

250

- Dean, why don't we have an exclusive interview with Li Yubing later?
- Sure.

251

He played so well in this game, right?

252
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,100
Right? Our XDragons hockey star.

253

Everyone, this is today's hero that led our team from defeat into a victory,

Just now, we saw the game with your superb skills.

258
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,300
You're also a man with a striking appearance.

Ah, thank you.

260
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,120
Li Yubing?

261
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,850
What's his relationship with Tang Xue?

262
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,300
Yubing, they are professors from MU

263
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,930
and their observation group. They specially came to observe our club this time.

264
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,420
If anyone has any questions, you can ask Li Yubing.

265
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,360
Leadership values this observation very much, so you have to say good things.

266
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,250
You can emphasize the general manager's outstanding contributions or something like that.

267
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,300
Okay.

268
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,300
Hello, Li Yubing, I'm Bian Cheng.

269
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,120
What's his relationship with Tang Xue?

270
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,270
Why did he try to get Tang Xue's cap?

271
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,840
Hello.

272
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,390
I heard LUU and XDragons Club worked together for more than two years.

273
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,650
In regards to the European and American new model of selecting new players from the campus,

274
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,830
for your hockey team, what's your greatest advantage and difficulty?

275
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,840
Ah, right.

276
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,800
What right? He's asking you a question.

277
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,450
Sorry, I didn't hear it clearly.

278
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,760
It's okay then I'll change the question.

279
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,620
They say that apart from your ice hockey studies, you are also minoring in astronomy.

280
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,680
He must have a story with Tang Xue.

281
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,570
Then as a hockey player, before the competition, you must need a lot of time to train.

282
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,610
Under these circumstances, how do you have time to study?

283
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,430
You said before the competition, right?

284
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,470
We don't study before the competition.

285
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,170
No, he meant doing study simultaneously. Studying simultaneously.

286
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,540
Ah, studying simultaneously.

287
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,590
I think being an outstanding athlete,

288
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:44,380
you need very strong reflection skills and studying skills. At the same time, being able to handle both studying and practicing.

289
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,920
We really encourage younger athletes to learn more.

290
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,650
Then, even if they retire from the sport, it can help them in the real world.

291
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,230
Of course, all of this is done under the careful supervision of our general manager.

292
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,030
Why did you come here?

293
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,530
I heard Liao Zhenyu say that you met your first love and then...

294
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,620
Blabber mouth.

295
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,490
Why did you sit here? Be careful not to get sick.

296
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,060
It's none of your business.

297
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,760
Can you not rub everything on your clothes? Good thing you're washing it yourself this time.

298
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,720
You washed it last time?

299
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,740
You took me to the hotel?

300
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,170
Last time, I was afraid everyone would say the hockey team's assistant slept on the streets.

301
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,280
So, your first love is...

302
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,480
Bian Cheng?

303
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,260
Is it your business?

304
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,710
I won't mention it.

305
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,770
But if you want to say, I can help by listening to you.

306
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,340
It's not called "first love."

307
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,070
At most, it was an unrequited love.

308
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,420
Why would you secretly like him?

309
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
I also don't know.

310
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,720
Perhaps everyone will have someone like that during that time. You didn't have one?

311
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,890
I didn't. I'm very busy.

312
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,350
Then, do you still like him right now?

313
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,980
Some feelings cannot be generalized by like or dislike.

314
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,300
Because that was my entire youth.

315
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,300
Such a coincidence.

316
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,690
Such a coincidence.

317
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,100
♫ Snowflakes are falling, ♫

318
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,670
♫ do you see them? ♫

319
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:45,040
♫ Holding your hand so tightly, it’s warm that I’m melting ♫

320
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,120
♫ Snowflakes are falling, ♫

321
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,900
♫ I want to become them ♫

322
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,200
♫ Year after year, they stay by your side as a sweet fairy tale ♫

323
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,220
Such a coincidence.

324
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm leaving now.

325
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,020
In that period of my youth, there was Liao Zhenyu,

326
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,650
Bian Cheng, Zhou Ran, and many others...

327
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,010
But no me.

328
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,020
How much do you like him?

329
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,040
Liking him to the point when I dreamed of getting into the same university as him every day.

330
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,540
Back then when you wanted to go to the same middle school as me, did you also feel like that?

331
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,440
So you gave up skating for him?

332
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,380
Tang Xue?

333
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,060
You came?

334
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,580
Are you going to the competition?

335
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,290
I'm going soon. Do you have time to watch?

336
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,720
I'm very sorry.

337
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,790
At the lunch break, I need to do mock exam questions, so I can't go.

338
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,110
Did you want to ask me something?

339
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,820
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

340
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,470
Open it when you get back.

341
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,420
Tang Xue! What are you doing? We're leaving.

342
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,130
I'm coming!

343
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,390
I'm leaving now. Let's talk after I come back.

344
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,730
This is Tang Xue. Her competition scores in the past are very steady.

345
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,340
She has potential. We can observe her for this year's National Youth Team.

346
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,840
I saw her previous scores.

347
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,000
She broke the record in Hucheng's Youth Short Track Team.

348
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,870
She has good potential.

349
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,950
Tang Xue, I received your feelings,

350
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,850
but my priority is to get into university. I don't have time to date.

351
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,020
Tang Xue, what are you doing? Hurry and change your shoes. It's time to get on the rink now.

353
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,000
It seems like her starting reflex is a bit slow.

354
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,400
- Tang Xue!
- Tang Xue!
- Are you okay?

355
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,670
Can I still compete in

356
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
the national championships in two months?

357
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,800
Xue'er, you should focus on getting better first.

358
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,840
Your injury this time was pretty serious. Many of your soft tissues were injured.

359
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,660
The doctors said it'll take at least half a year for your leg to fully heal.

360
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,750
Okay, I'll wait until my leg heals. After my leg heals, I'll start training again.

361
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,330
There's no way I can't get back to the same skill level as before.

362
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,370
I just need physical therapy, right? I'll start right now.

363
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,720
How can you get out of bed right now?

364
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,350
In your current state, even if you fully recover,

365
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,120
you can't go back to your former skill level anyway.

366
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,060
And your injury might flare up again in future tournaments.

367
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,340
- Impossible!
- That's what the doctor said.

368
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,650
Am I unable to skate anymore?

369
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,400
The reason Dad had you go to high school

370
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,070
was so that you would have a backup plan,

371
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,690
so that in the future you would always have another option.

372
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,620
When school starts, you'll be a second year. With your injury, you can't train anymore.
(high school in China is 3 years)

373
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,810
Let's just focus on the college entrance exam.

374
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,500
I want to ice skate!

375
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,470
Xue'er.

376
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,260
Mom and Dad only have you.

377
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,090
Our biggest wish

378
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,130
is for you to be safe and healthy your whole life.

379
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,800
That's all.

380
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,910
Can you think about it from our perspective?

381
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,130
She missed it just by a little. If she had nicked an artery, her life would be in danger.

382
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,300
- Tang Xue, we'll get going.
- Bye-bye.

383
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:43,700
Gifted Scholar, I heard you got early admission to MU. Is it true?

384
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,520
Good for you!

385
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,880
Bian Cheng rejected you and influenced your selection opportunity.

386
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,680
So you gave up short track speed skating.

387
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,350
Do you hate him?

388
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:14,430
I only hate myself. Why was I so weak-hearted?

389
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,400
Why didn't I get back on the ice after recovering?

390
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,260
Why did I let go of my dream so easily?

391
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,960
Don't be so careless from now on.

392
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,770
You've changed.

393
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,900
How so?

394
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,220
The younger Li Yubing, who was scared of bugs

395
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,270
and thugs is all grown up.

398
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,150
For today's activity, our students will be young commentators.

399
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,670
After you finish an explanation, you can ask for a ticket stub from the visitors.

400
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,660
You can exchange three ticket stubs for a red flower.

401
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,310
Red flowers can be exchanged for different rewards.

402
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,800
There's stationery, toys, backpacks. Does everyone understand?

403
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,700
- Yes!
- Good.

404
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,000
- Sister, Uncle, Auntie, can I explain this to you?
- Sure.

405
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,100
It's free.

406
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,020
- Thank you for listening.
- Pretty good.

407
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,500
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

408
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,330
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good job today.

409
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,520
Excuse me, Sir. How was that little girl's explanation?

410
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,090
That child said this place used to be where Madam White Snake and Xiaoqing used to cultivate.
(characters in Legend of the White Snake)

411
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,510
- She said it was a secret that no one else knew.
- This is complete nonsense.

412
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,420
Then, how come you still gave her the ticket stubs?

413
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,850
Because she's so cute!

414
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,120
Auntie, let me explain it to you.

415
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,600
Auntie, I explained it better.

416
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,380
Auntie, I memorized the explanation. Pick me.

417
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,340
Pick me. I'm so cute.

418
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,230
Pick me.

419
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,200
- These kids are so cute.
- Auntie.

420
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,990
Pick me. Choose me.

421
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,720
Hi, Sister.

422
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,000
How come you're calling me "Sister"?

423
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,060
You're so young, should I call you Auntie instead?

424
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,430
Move over! Move over!

425
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,520
Sister, this is Li Yubing. We're the commentators here.

426
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,430
It's free. He hasn't explained to anyone yet today.

427
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,700
Can you let him explain to you? Please! Please!

428
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,300
- Call me "Sister."
- Sister.

429
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,350
Then today, you'll explain to me.
