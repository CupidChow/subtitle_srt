Boss Zhen, are you expecting us to have problems?

It's good that you have no problem. Please take good care of us for the competition today.

Old Deng, what are you doing? Call him.

Don't you think everyone here is amazing?

317
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,640
Since when you become so timid? It's not like you.

318
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,080
There's definitely something going on. What happened?

319
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,430
We broke up.

320
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,400
The Tang Xue and Li Yubing I know

321
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,250
don't give up easily.

322
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,730
He already gave up.

323
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,860
Liking someone only takes an instance.

324
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,190
Tang Xue, he likes you.

325
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,280
Trust me.

326
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,840
I can feel it.

327
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,130
I'll talk to him when I get back then.

328
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,370
No wonder you turned off your phone. You are bothered by it.

329
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,800
Why did you turn off your phone?

330
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,200
So... I could train better and be more focused.

331
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm telling you. I'm not going easy on you any longer.

332
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,260
You better keep your spirits up.

333
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,050
Ever since I joined the speed skating team, I set a goal for myself.

334
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,750
It is to surpass you.

335
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,560
You didn't compete in the last competition because of your injury.

336
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,610
Although I won, it feels like my business isn't finished.

337
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,920
So I declare seriously.

338
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,580
Every day of the intensive training moving forward, I'll do my best

339
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,010
and become an opponent you respect.

340
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,530
I'm very serious.

341
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,960
Okay. Let's see what you can do.

342
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,510
Someone doesn't know herself and picked a strong opponent.

343
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,070
What? Are you afraid?

344
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,540
In my dictionary, there's no such phrase as "afraid."

345
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,870
Sure. Then get up and let's go another round.

346
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:18,050
Dog, I miss you too.

347
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,810
Do you miss him?

348
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,590
Of course not.

349
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,140
I know you are careless.

350
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,830
I brought an extra bottle for you.

351
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,420
Let's go.

352
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,540
You did well when Li Yubing was injured.

353
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,640
Calm and swift while handling it. It means you have solid foundations.

354
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,470
I'm surprised.

355
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,290
Thank you for your encouragement.

356
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,150
- Keep it up, young man. I have high hopes for you.
- Thank you.

357
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,910
- You can go now.
- See you.

358
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,200
- Huan-huan.
- So cool!

359
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,110
So awesome!

360
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,490
That's because our Huan-huan taught me well.

361
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,050
I won't be here without your encouragement.

362
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,330
Since you've improved a lot,

363
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,370
7:00 p.m. tonight at Home for Homeless Babies. I'll be waiting.

364
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,170
Let's go on a date.

365
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,560
What did you say? Li Yubing was late because he was beaten up?

366
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
The police took his statement already.

367
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,270
But the location is a blind spot for surveillance cameras. There's no physical evidence.

368
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,440
But... why? Did Li Yubing offend them?

369
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,570
He didn't know them at all.

370
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,370
Oh my god.

371
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,600
Fortunately, he's physically fine. My little heart can't take this.

372
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm telling you, this is definitely fishy.

373
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,310
There's something even more fishy.

374
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,100
Li Yubing told me he received an anonymous call before he left.

375
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,730
In the call, someone told him Tang Xue was injured. So he went out.

376
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,140
Then he was beaten up. Think about it. An anonymous call right before the game.

377
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,790
A lead player was beaten up. A coincidence?

378
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,790
You are saying...

379
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,580
I'm only speculating about this but we have to consider it as a possibility.

380
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm going to training.

381
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,870
[Home for Homeless Babies]

382
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,750
Huan-huan.

383
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,690
Xiao Huan-huan.

384
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,070
Xiao Huan-huan.

385
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,710
Huan-huan, being naughty again?

386
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,800
I'll turn on the light.

387
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,490
Wait.

388
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,950
I'll do it.

389
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,290
What are you doing?

390
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,980
What...

391
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,060
This is an anniversary celebration from your most loyal fan.

392
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,900
- Anniversary?
- Our 180 days together.

393
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,730
You always gave me surprises in the past. Now it's my turn.

394
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,580
I'm sorry, I really didn't have a lot of time.

395
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,040
I didn't have time to buy candles. Bear with my makeshift.

396
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,250
- Let's blow it out together.
- Okay.

397
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,690
Huan-huan, after these 180 days,

398
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,900
I'll still be willing to be your little servant.

399
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,490
No.

400
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,550
You've been my little servant for 180 days.

401
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,690
You are my little prince from now on.

402
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,580
Xiao Yu, you know.

403
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm very content now.

404
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,300
No matter how accomplished we are in the future,

405
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,610
as long as we are together and work hard,

406
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,160
I'm very happy.

407
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,270
And I feel like there are no better boyfriends than you in this world.

408
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,700
You treat me like a princess, then you are my little prince.
