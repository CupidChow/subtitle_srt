You two have such a good relationship now?

- When was it not good?
- Right?

No. No. No. You've definitely contributed.

I've heard that this bag has never been produced in this color,

Did you ruin his attractiveness?

255
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,090
Nonsense. That's because you're not interested in him now.

Can't you just send some tape over?

Why tire yourself out like this?

296

With her personality, there's no way she'd be able to wait.

297

She has to wait until the higher-ups finish watching it before she comes back, right?

By the way, how is Yu Yan recently? Why do I feel like his heart isn't in it?

303

Manager Ma, don't worry. With a gold-medal coach like me,

304
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,310
I won't let Yu Yan hold back the XDragons.

After hearing you say that, I'm relieved.

I have.

315
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,900
If you want to lose weight, I think you need to play for a few more years.

I saw you looking restless. What's wrong?

320
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,520
I've sent so many resumes

321
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,590
to so many clubs, but none of them want me.

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,510
I won't be able to play ice hockey anymore.

325
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,680
What are you talking about? Have you brought it up to Manager Ma?

326
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,330
I know.

327
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,540
The XDragons professional team has a high standard. If I were good enough,

328
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,640
Manager Ma would've talked to me a long time ago.

329
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,290
So the XDragons' professional team recruits players

330
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,950
based on strength and techniques.

331
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,170
Get some rest.

332
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,520
You never know, everything might be better tomorrow.

333
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,740
Ice God, you're making things difficult for me.

334
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,940
Jiang Shijia's current ability is good enough for the college league tournament.

335
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,870
But once you get to the professional league tournament,

336
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,860
your competitors won't be at the college level.

337
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm telling you. Right now, in the whole LUU XDragons team,

338
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,660
only you have the potential to play in the professional league tournament.

339
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,190
In the whole team, Big Jiang and I have the best teamwork.

340
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,880
If I join the XDragons professional team later, no one will be able to replace Big Jiang.

341
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,050
Yubing, in your new environment, you'll have new teammates.

342
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,840
They will all be more skilled than Jiang Shijia.

343
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,600
And you will work together better, too.

344
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,860
But Jiang Shijia will improve, too.

345
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,540
If Jiang Shijia's ability were good enough,

346
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,900
the club would've done something about it already.

347
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,950
Yubing, there's something you have to understand.

348
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,380
Sometimes, people want to do something, but they just lack the ability to do it.

349
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,000
This world is just cruel sometimes.

350
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,700
I don't care. If I'm going to keep playing hockey, for me,

351
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,400
Jiang Shijia is irreplaceable.

352
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,240
Okay, okay, okay, my little ancestor.

353
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,330
I'll go talk to the chairman tomorrow, but no promises.

354
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,420
Manager Ma, I knew I could count on you.

Did you fight with Xia Menghuan?

359
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,740
No. Isn't the XDragons team looking for a medical assistant?

360
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,780
Yeah.

361
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,740

Why did you get rejected?

364
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,480
Your team doctor likes me, but she says I'm just a freshman.

365
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,920
I don't have enough experience and I have too many classes.

366
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,310
She doesn't think I can handle this job.

367
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:48,380
So... I think that if she gives me a chance, I can do it.

368
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,810
I even made a plan.

369
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,870
But no matter what I say, she doesn't believe me.

I wouldn't come if it was an easy job. I came because I wanted to gain experience.

No, no. I'll buy you a meal. With your specialty in this career,

- I'll have to depend on you in the future.

Are you still worrying about the professional hockey teams?

I've known you for so long,

393

but I don't even know when you started playing ice hockey.

394
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,600
Did you start when you were little, like Li Yubing?

395
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,970
I'm different from him. I was converted later in life.

396
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,390
I still remember the first time I played ice hockey,

397
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,950
I just wanted to keep playing.

398
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,590
I think that people doing what they love

399
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,940
is the luckiest thing that can happen.

400
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,150
I know that I'm not that skilled at ice hockey. In terms of techniques,

401
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,170
I don't have talent.

402
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,250
Maybe entering the professional team

403
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,410
really is just an extravagant hope.

404
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,800
But I like hockey.

405
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,400
So if I can't play in the future, I'll feel like a failure.

Hey!

How do you define failure?

408
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,360
Not being acknowledged by others...

409
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,340
is failure.

410
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,130
Are you playing hockey because you want to be acknowledged by other people?

411
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,010
Or is it to be acknowledged by yourself?

412

Look at how much you like hockey.

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,370
as long as you've tried and fought hard,

416
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,530
no matter what the result is, you're already your own winner.

00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,980
He's been having a heavy class load, and he's a medical volunteer.

483
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,050
He's so busy every day, how would he have time for me?

484
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,530
Then aren't you two in a long-distance relationship despite being on the same campus?

485
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,810
What can I do? I was the one who encouraged him to volunteer.

486
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,550
We also set a flag at the time.

487
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,990
We said we would squeeze time out to date.

488
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,750
Guess what happened?

489
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,550
Time for dating is like here. Can't even squeeze it out.

490
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,550
When you go to the group training, your Dog

491
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,230
is also going to have a long-distance relationship with you.

492
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,960
Marlinsky once said,

493
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,980
"People are always fascinated by an inexperienced first love,

494
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,530
but love that can withstand anything is priceless."

495
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,650
You two...

496
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,020
are about to experience the test of love.

497
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,960
I'm going to the restroom.

498
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,140
Dog.

499
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,510
You guessed it so quickly. You're no fun.

500
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,330
Then, do you want to hear something interesting?

501
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,030
What is it?

502
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,320
My dad says he wants to come and see you.

503
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,230
Why does Uncle Tang want to come?

504
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,590
I got into the national team shortlist, didn't I? I'm going to group training soon.

505
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,420
So, my dad said he wants to see me,

506
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,470
and he also wants to have a chat with you.

507
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,910
I have a game that day.

508
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,770
I haven't even said which day.

509
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,160
Whichever day he comes is the day that I have a game.

510
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,510
When did you become such a coward?

511
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,260
My dad isn't that scary.

512
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,630
According to a reliable source, this time my dad

513
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,930
is here to give you a title.

514
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,170
Uncle Tang isn't against our relationship anymore?

515
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,410
Ask him yourself.

516
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,190
But I have a question to ask you.

517
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,340
My training this time will be a closed-off style

518
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,110
so that means I won't see you for a few months.

519
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,660
Will you obediently wait for me to return?

520
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,840
Tang Xue,

521
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,170
we were separated for six years,

522
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,770
and I was barely able to escape from the palm of your hands to Lincheng.

523
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,950
It's only going to be a few months.

524
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,960
The farthest I'll escape to will be the school's entrance. What are you worried about?

525
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,190
I'm just asking.

526
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,350
If you don't change, I won't change either.

527
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:56,690
Then for the unchanging us,

528
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,930
we can make any changes.

529
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:30,730
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

530
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:38,150
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫
