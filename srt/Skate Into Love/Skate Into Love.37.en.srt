Doctor, how is my son?

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,250
The surgery was very successful. Fortunately,

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,450
it was a chronic subdural hematoma.

22

Doctor, if the hematoma was caused by the incident from last time,

25
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,880
why wasn't it found at that time?

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,030
This happened because the hematoma developed slowly.

The day of the incident, his bleeding was still mild.

28

It appeared to be a normal external injury.

29

But because the patient participated in extreme training and sports,

his condition worsened.

we could have caught it a lot earlier and taken precautions in advance.

34
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,820

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,340
♫ You are irreplaceable in this world ♫

160
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,660
♫ The you who resolutely said would protect me has serious reasoning ♫

161
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,880
I'm going home with Little Sugar Cube.

162
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,980
Young lady, your boyfriend is so good to you.

163
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,810
When you fell asleep, he kept holding your head up with his hand.

164
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,950
After his left hand got tired, he switched to his right. Then when his right hand got tired, back to his left. During this ride, who knows how many times he switched his hands?

165
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,520
Dummy.

166
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,610
You smiled. My sky is finally sunny again.

167
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,490
♫ Two footprints kissing the snowy ground ♫

168
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,350
I'm a flamingo.

169
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,910
Flamingoes are my favorite.

170
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,490
The view is so pretty.

171
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,490
♫ Do you see them? ♫

172
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:59,950
♫ Holding your hand so tightly, it’s warm that I’m melting ♫

173
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,090
♫ Snowflakes are falling ♫

174
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,110
I was gone for such a short time, and look at what you did to yourself.

175
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,860
Are you dumb?

176
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,240
♫ They stay by your side as a sweet fairy tale ♫

177
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,460
We already broke up, and you dropped everything to save me.

178
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,840
If I were by your side, would this have been prevented?

179
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,540
I don't know how you survived the last 6 years without me.

180
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,190
But when I think about it,

181
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,360
I'm grateful to these last 6 years.

182
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,700
They made you into a better version of yourself

183
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,890
and returned you to me.

184
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,610
So don't worry.

185
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,470
You will definitely get through this.

186
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,550
I'm still waiting for you to compete in the Winter Olympics with me.

187
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,330
One night, I had a dream that

188
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:07,180
I won a gold medal in the Winter Olympics and you proposed to me on the spot.

189
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,880
Say, when we get married, how many kids should we have?

190
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,190
Probably two? So that they won't be lonely.

191
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,040
It'll be perfect since one of them can do speed skating, and the other can play hockey.

192
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,940
We'll call the older one Egg,

193
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,380
and the younger one Egg 2.

194
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,710
Okay?

195
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,590
So you have to hurry and wake up. I can't wait much longer, got it?

196
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,240
Got it?

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,540
It's been so many years,

198
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,990
but you haven't gotten any better at coming up with names.

199
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,990
You scared me to death!

200
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,450
Uncle! Auntie! He's awake!

201
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,870
Uncle! Auntie!

202
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,330
He's awake! He's awake!

203
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,900
Just now, I think I heard someone say she's going to marry me and we're going to have a son called Egg.

204
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,580
I have something to tell everyone. Li Yubing has woken up.

205
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,350
What? He woke up?

206
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,300
- When can he leave the hospital?
- Brothers.

207
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,130
Li Yubing is awake now,

208
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,380
but think about who made him this way.

209
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:30,220
We all played against the Black Scorpions that day, and we all know what happened to him before the game.

210
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,670
We also know why his injury is so serious.

211
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,970
Yes.

212
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,720
The police have no evidence. The people who hurt him are running free.

213
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,400
However, I can't handle seeing that happen.

214
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,890
I want to ask you guys, can you handle it?

215
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,610
- We can't.
- We can't.

216
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,150
The Black Scorpions are notorious for underhanded tactics.

217
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:01,110
Last time, when they played the Brown Bears, they injured the other team's main player and even broke his leg.

218
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,110
It's time someone taught them a lesson.

219
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,880
Big Jiang, what do you want to do? I support you unconditionally.

220
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,810
Brothers, what I want to do is very simple.

221
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,450
I want to take revenge for Li Yubing. You can join me if you want.

222
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,690
Let's go!

223
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,660
Today, we'll show the Black Scorpions that

224
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,920
the XDragons are not easy to mess with!

225
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,140
Let's go!

226
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,550
What are you guys doing?

227
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,520
Nothing.

228
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,410
If I came even a minute later, would something have happened?

229
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,680
Jiang Shijia, are you going to pick a fight? Go ahead.

230
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,390
The Black Scorpions attacked us first.

231
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,160
We, XDragons, can't just let them walk all over us.

232
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,350
Yeah!

233
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,390
Have you been reading too many wuxia novels?

234
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,330
Do you think it's heroic to take revenge? Let me tell you!

235
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,630
There's no hockey tournament in prison. You all don't want to play anymore, is that right?

236
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,480
- Coach!
- Stop talking!

237
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,930
Get changed! Start practicing!

238
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,950
You're not listening to me?

239
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,440
Do I need to say everything twice?

240
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,570
You don't play for a few days and this is what happens?

241
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,770
Can you not make me worry so much?

242
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,780
Get changed! Assistant Coach is waiting for you on the ice!

243
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,460
Eat slowly. Why are you in such a rush? No one's going to take it from you.

244
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,310
It's because it's delicious.

245
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,710
Drink some water.

246
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,720
You have no idea. Since Li Yubing entered the hospital,

247
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,970
I haven't been able to eat or sleep.

248
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,860
It's a good thing he finally woke up. Otherwise...

249
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,720
Otherwise, what?

250
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,760
Otherwise, I'd feel guilty. I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.

251
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,910
You weren't the one that hurt him, why would you feel so guilty?

252
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,360
But I'm an intern doctor assistant.

253
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,350
So I think I'm partly responsible for him lying in the hospital right now.

254
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,300
When Li Yubing first showed symptoms, if I had been more insistent and firm with him,

255
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,470
and he had come to the hospital for another checkup, then maybe things wouldn't be as bad right now.

256
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,580
Li Yubing's already woken up now. Stop blaming yourself.

257
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,930
You're just a first-year medical student. Relax.

258
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,670
Yes, Li Yubing's woken up. But what if he hadn't woken up?

259
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,210
Right?

260
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,990
If Li Yubing wasn't dizzy before the game, but he was hit by someone during the game and fell unconscious,

261
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,280
and his condition worsened, what then?

262
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,550
That's why I have to take some responsibility for this. I need to be more strict and detailed.

263
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,130
Xiao Yu,

264
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,300
have you realized that you're now very responsible and matured?

265
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,860
How come you're suddenly praising me?

266
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,800
It's because you've taught me well.

267
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,780
I want to stand on equal footing with you.

268
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,350
By the way, Huan-huan, you'll have to take better care of Master Tang.

269
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,030
It's true that Li Yubing has woken up, but we're still not sure of his condition.

270
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,190
Master Tang must be really vulnerable right now. Make sure you take good care of her.

271
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,230
Don't worry. I already have it all planned with Old Ye.

272
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,160
Our Huan-huan is so attentive.

273
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,000
[Resume]

274
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Hey!

275
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,300
How is Li Yubing's recovery going?

276
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,400
The surgery was very successful.

277
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,900
But while he's recovering, there might be changes to the main center position.

278
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,500
Actually, as the team coach,

279
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,800
I understand why the club is doing this.
[Song Anjie]

280
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
But I've taught Li Yubing for so many years.

281
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,700
I feel so bad for him, especially since he's still recovering.

282
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,000
If I tell him, I'm afraid he won't be able to accept it.

283
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,200
He's an athlete that you taught so he's not that weak.

284
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,800
There's no use in overthinking it.

285
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,600
What you should do now is take care of yourself,

286
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,300
so that you can take better care of your players.

287
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Here, drink some chicken soup.

288
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,000
Chicken soup?

289
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah.

290
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
This one is for Li Yubing, this one is for you.

291
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,400
Did you order takeout? Or did Coach Jin make it for you?

292
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,900
What are you talking about? I stewed it for five hours.

293
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,200
Try it.

294
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,400
No way. I've known you for so many years and you've never made soup.

295
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Are you going to drink it or not?

296
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,700
Of course, I'll drink it.

297
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,050
Is it good?

298
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
- It's good.
- Let me try.

299
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,200
Let me try it.

300
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,500
So silly.

301
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Big Xu, I found that cooking and doing dishes isn't as hard as I thought it was.

302
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,000
If you like drinking soup, from now on, I'll make it for you every day. Okay?

303
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,900
No need! No need!

304
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,900
You— What do you mean? Why are you so weird today?
(T/N: is the sun rising from the west today?)

305
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,800
Why are you being so nice to me?

306
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,400
You don't want me to? If you don't want me to then never mind.

307
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I want you to.

308
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,300
To be honest, I was too busy with training in the past.

309
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,800
All the things that a man should do at home, you did them all.

310
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,500
I'm really sorry.

311
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,700
It's okay.

312
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,300
I was always practicing, too. You did all the things that a woman should do at home.

313
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,600
And the issue of having kids...

314
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Anyway, it's not all your fault.

315
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,980
I want to tell you... I'm sorry.

316
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,200
Actually, I didn't want to break up at all.

317
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,500
I...

318
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,600
Look at me.

319
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,700
Just give me one more chance. Just one more, okay?

320
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,000
It's all in the past.

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,200
I wasn't going to say it, but you made me say it. Now I'm so embarrassed that I said it.

322
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Never mind, I won't say it anymore.

323
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,200
But from now on, it's a fresh start.

324
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,900
From now on— What fresh start?

325
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you dumb?

326
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
You agreed?

327
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,500
That's great.

328
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Xiao Xia, I need you to promise me something.

329
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,600
In the future, I'll do all the cooking.

330
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
What do you mean?

331
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,000
- Are you saying I'm bad at cooking?
- No, no.

332
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
- You are, you're saying I can't cook.
- No, no, it's not that.

333
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Your cooking is good, it's great!

334
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,000
Dad, stop cracking walnuts.

335
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,800
Eating walnuts isn't going to help me get better.

336
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,200
Your mom assigned me this task.

337
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,400
She said that eating walnuts is good for your brain.

338
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,000
She said you have to eat them no matter what.

339
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,600
Here, eat one. It can't hurt.

340
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,640
She's just worried about you,

341
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,600
and she doesn't know what to do for you.

342
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,630
You recovered this time,

343
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,190
but next time...

344
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,300
It's my fault.

345
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,990
Uncle.

346
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,100
Tang Xue, come! You chat with him.

347
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm going out to take a walk.

348
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Here, sit.

349
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,600
Are you feeling better?

350
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
This is the chicken soup that Coach Chu specifically made for you.

351
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,000
She and Coach Xu are busy, so they asked me to bring it to you.

352
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,800
I've already caused them so much trouble by getting hurt.

353
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Tell them to stop worrying about me, or I'll feel bad.

354
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,640
By the way, did you receive the notification letter for the national team yet?

355
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,920
Is it good?

356
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,900
I understand why Big Xu is so good at cooking now.

357
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,200
He was forced to learn how because of his circumstances.

358
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,200
That's enough.

359
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,490
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

360
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Are you dumb?

361
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
I am dumb.

362
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,300
It's to match my girlfriend's IQ.

363
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
I'm already like this, and you still hit me? Do you have a conscience?

364
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
If we hadn't broken up...

365
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,000
Close your eyes.

366
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,300
What?

367
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,200
Close your eyes.

368
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,700
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream ♫

369
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,200
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

370
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,800
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

371
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,600
Why did you throw it around so carelessly?

372
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,200
Is it because you think it's ugly, or because it's too cheap?

373
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
I'll wear it for the rest of my life.

374
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,000
When I shower, when I sleep, even when it rusts or gets old, I won't take it off.

375
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,060
You know, you really look like a Teletubby right now.

376
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
Come, hug the Teletubby.

377
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,000
♫  ...when I met you ♫

378
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,600
Fatty, why are you spacing out?

379
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,700
Don't you think that Tang Xue's confession at Bing-bing's bedside

380
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,100
was so touching, heart-rendering,

381
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,200
brought tears to your eyes, and penetrated deeply into your heart?

382
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,900
Are you jealous?

383
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,300
Bing-bing is handsome

384
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,900
and good at hockey, and has such a romantic love story, too.

385
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,700
Are you not jealous?

386
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,020
Jealous, my butt!

387
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,400
Everyone, gather around.

388
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,400
I have some news to tell everyone.

389
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,000
Well... Everyone knows that

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,200
after Li Yubing's injury, the club has been very worried.

391
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
But considering the team's future development,

392
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,000
we've decided to bring in a new player.

393
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
What? Why?

394
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,000
Coach Xu, what's the meaning of this?

395
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,180
I know everyone has a deep relationship with Li Yubing.

396
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,000
As the captain, every victory we have is

397
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,400
because of his hard work.

398
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,200
But he's in the hospital right now, and we don't know when he will recover.

399
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,300
Our team needs a strong center.

400
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,700
Coach, Li Yubing is still in the hospital.

401
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,000
Isn't it cruel of the club to do this right now?

402
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,400
Yeah. Exactly.

403
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Everyone, you're not understanding what I'm saying.

404
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,000
Coach Xu, you've taught Li Yubing since he was little.

405
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,400
I would never have thought that even you would treat him this way.

406
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,600
- Exactly.
- He's no longer useful to you.
(T/N: idiom: abandoning someone upon achieving one's goal)

407
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,400
- That's exactly right.
- How can you do this?

408
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,100
How can the club do this to him?

409
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,800
That's enough!

410
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,000
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to?

411
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
When I see Li Yubing like this,

412
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,600
do you think my heart doesn't hurt?

413
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,600
Everyone is thinking with their emotions right now. How will that solve the problem at hand?

414
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,200
Can we solve the team's problem or Li Yubing's problem?

415
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,200
What Li Yubing needs right now is time, not us naively taking his side.

416
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,000
You guys tell me.

417
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,300
Which of you can replace Li Yubing

418
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,100
and lead the team to victory?

419
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,200
You?

420
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,000
Or you?

421
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,090
Or you?

422
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,420
Say something!

423
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,400
This is the club's decision.

424
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,400
The new player will arrive soon. Everyone, cooperate with him.

425
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,200
I hope when Li Yubing returns to the team,

426
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,800
he returns to a strong team, not a mess.

427
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,400
When Heaven gives someone a responsibility,
(T/N: a saying from Mencius)

428
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,900
it will first fill his heart with suffering, toil his tendons and bones, and expose him to hunger.
(T/N: a saying from Mencius)

429
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,100
People who seem to be winning at life don't have it that easy either.

430
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,590
Fatty, are you still jealous of him?

431
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,800
That doesn't matter right now.

432
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,700
Say, do you think we should tell Bing-bing about this?

433
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,800
- We have to tell him.
- Yes.

434
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
We have to.

435
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Well... You tell him.

436
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
You tell him.

437
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,600
It's not suitable for me to tell him. You tell him.

438
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,700
I can't say it.

439
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,700
You good-for-nothing. What's the point of having you?

440
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,400
Say...

441
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,700
will Bing-bing be really sad when he finds out that someone is replacing him?

442
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:33,200
That's not the main point. What I'm most scared of is that telling him will affect his recovery.

443
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Should we wait until he's been discharged from the hospital and then tell him?

444
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,500
Okay.

445
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,300
In any case, in our team, to me, the only C-position player is Li Yubing.

446
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,600
As long as we're here, no one can make Bing-bing sad.

447
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,700
What are you doing?

448
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,000
That hurts.

449
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,930
It should be right around that corner.

450
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,190
- Room 3 is up front.
- It's up there, let's go.

451
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,320
- Let's go.
- Come on.

452
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,590
Aunt, it's here.

453
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,110
Uncle. Auntie.

454
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,740
Li Yubing, are you okay?

455
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,840
- I'm okay.
- That's good then.

456
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,180
Doctor Zhou and Teacher Tang, why are you here?

457
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,910
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

458
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,740
It's been so long since we saw each other.

459
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,450
- We haven't seen each other in 6 or 7 years right?
- Yes, time passes so quickly.

460
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,100
It's already been 6 or 7 years.

461
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,850
We heard from Ran-ran that Yubing was injured.

462
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,640
So we came to see him.

463
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,410
Thank you for coming all this way.

464
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,330
Yubing has really caused everyone a lot of trouble this time.

465
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,550
- It's nothing.
- Tang Xue didn't even want to tell me about this.

466
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,740
They just didn't want you to worry, right?

467
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,110
She was worried that if I found out, I'd try to make them break up.

468
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,030
What are you talking about?

469
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,120
Uncle.

470
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,800
Everything you said back then... came true.

471
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,050
The collisions and injuries that happen on a playing field

472
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,070
are inevitable.

473
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,900
More than that, hockey brings us responsibility,

474
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,860
the courage to face difficulties, and the athletic spirit of never giving up.

475
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,650
If I give up hockey because I'm afraid of injuries,

476
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,650
I'll always be the 12-year-old boy

477
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,490
who couldn't keep a promise and ran away in the face of problems.

478
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,870
I also don't know how far I'll go.

479
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,570
But I know that we need people like me to keep fighting so that China can become strong in hockey.

480
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,120
Sooner or later, someone like Xu Feng will appear among us.

481
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,940
An athlete who is active in international competitions.

482
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,870
To tell the world,

483
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,200
us Chinese are also good at ice hockey.

484
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,960
Li Yubing, I always remembered what you said back then.

485
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,930
Remember. Behind you...

486
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,360
is your family's support.

487
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,740
Other than your parents,

488
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,110
you have us, too.

489
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,300
We are one family.

490
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,860
Aunt and Uncle, you guys are going back to Hucheng today?

491
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,130
I'm on-call at the hospital tonight, so we need to go back.

492
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,360
Now that we know Li Yubing is all right, we're more at ease.

493
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,230
But I never thought that

494
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,230
Xiao Xue was all grown up. She knows how to take care of others now.

495
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,210
The next few months, give Xiao Xue some more living expenses

496
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,720
so that she can buy some health supplements for Li Yubing.

497
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,270
Seems like Uncle is a die-hard fan of the Crystal Sugar CP (couple) now.

498
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,550
Isn't that right?

499
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,720
I wonder who it was that used to oppose their relationship the most in the beginning.

500
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,890
Who could it be?

501
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,510
When did I oppose it?

502
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,800
I just was a tiny bit worried.

503
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,120
Yes, yes, just a tiny bit worried.

504
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,440
Bian Cheng!

505
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,510
Uncle Tang.

506
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,900
Uncle Tang, it's all my fault.

507
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,080
Go ahead and scold me.

508
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,650
It's all in the past.

509
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,090
Who wasn't vain and made mistakes when they were younger?

510
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,720
I've made mistakes, too. It's normal.

511
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,560
This is called "reaching Heaven and Earth with our hands

512
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,680
but put our heart within the rules."

513
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,930
This is Uncle Tang's motto.

514
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,220
Though I'm just the editor-in-chief of a small newspaper.

515
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,180
I don't really have the right to teach a

516
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,540
top student from Minghua University.

517
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,080
Uncle Tang, please don't say that.

518
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,420
How have you been recently?

519
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,340
Are you prepared to be the watchman at the bow?

520
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,820
Be the watchman at the bow?

521
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,250
Looking for unexpected weather and reefs.

522
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,560
Giving timely warnings.

523
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,400
Uncle Tang,

524
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,550
I think that as I get older,

525
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,420
I'm forgetting why I started in the first place.

526
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,600
Bian Cheng, compared to others your age, you matured young.

527
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,320
You're clear-minded and logical, and you know what your goal is.

528
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,550
But no matter how much you understand the theory,

529
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,220
nothing can replace falling down a few times.

530
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,750
That experience will help you mature.

531
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,880
Remember, don't stay stuck in the past.

532
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,480
It's never too late to change.

533
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,090
Fatty, let's go to the hospital to see Bing-bing.

534
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,820
Isn't it too late? Let's go another day.

535
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,960
- Do you have somewhere to be?
- No.

536
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,020
Who would believe you?

537
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,500
Let me see.
[A Panoramic View of People]

538
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,600
Let me see.

539
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,300
You're always reading this book recently. What's it about?

540
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,210
My field of expertise: the study of love.

541
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,220
I received some advice from an expert.

542
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,470
I developed a deep understanding of psychology.

543
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,080
I also studied the philosophy department's professional knowledge.

544
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,350
Teacher Deng's Classroom will see the light of day again.

545
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,220
An expert?

546
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,960
Who?

547
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,360
Ye Liuying?

548
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,760
You two, really. I've had enough of you.

549
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,970
But it's not a bad thing.

550
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,620
At least you have a goal.

551
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,810
You're seeing a panoramic view of people.

552
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,800
Not like me.

553
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,930
- I don't know where my path is.
- What's wrong?

554
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,440
You still haven't gotten results about finding a club?

555
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,620
- It's not looking good.
- Don't lose hope.

556
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,100
Even blind cats find dead mice.

557
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,160
Wait, wait.

558
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,940
That's not what I meant.

559
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,800
What I mean is, there will definitely be a team that needs a player like you.

560
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,660
Trust me! You can do it!

561
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,090
Okay.

562
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,120
I'll take your word for it. If there really is a team that wants me,

563
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,400
I'll treat you to a meal.

564
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,060
I'll take it. I'm heading out now.

565
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,140
I'm going to ask for advice from Teacher Ye.

566
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,560
I'm leaving.

567
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,600
Teacher Ye.

568
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,930
How nice.

569
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,950
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫
