00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,040
He needs to relax and be less emotional.

166
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,130
More importantly, he needs friends and family to keep him company.

167
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,430
He doesn't eat or talk to me now.

168
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,570
He'll throw a fit when I ask anything.

169
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,650
And he doesn't have any friends.

170
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,720
I can only think of you.

171
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,170
Tang Xue, I did offend you last time.

172
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,070
But I hope you can understand.

173
00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:00,560
Every mother in the world will think she's doing the best for her child.

174
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,970
I saw on his phone that

175
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,470
he has only one contact.

176
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,120
It's you.

177
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,670
I have no other choice.

178
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,940
I could only ask for your help.

179
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,400
I was really offensive the other day.

180
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,080
How about this? Tell me your conditions.

181
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,060
I'll meet all your demands. If anything,

182
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,820
I will apologize to you.

183
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,420
Auntie,

184
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,640
Yu Yan is my friend.

185
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,480
I don't have conditions to help him.

186
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,010
Thank you.

187
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,550
Yu Yan?

188
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,490
I'm coming in.

189
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,270
Why are you here?

190
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,800
Sorry, I want to be alone.

191
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,190
Little sheep, why doesn't Yu Yan want to talk to me?

192
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,110
Because he didn't eat anything so he doesn't have any energy to talk.

193
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,200
Why doesn't he eat or have any energy?

194
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,270
Because there's no...

195
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,000
ice cream, fried chicken, or coke.

196
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,670
Where can we find ice cream, fried chicken, and coke?

197
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,490
The aquarium has them!

198
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,230
Let's go to the aquarium, okay?

199
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,140
But I have to prepare for the competition.

200
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,090
Do you remember Master Tang said,

201
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,950
you're supposed to control the ice blade, not the other way around.

202
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,180
But I can't control anything now.

203
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,200
Because you are not the Yu Yan I know.

204
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,260
The Yu Yan I know...

205
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,190
will encourage me to pursue my dreams

206
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,880
and will tell me to be one with the ice.

207
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,200
The little sheep I know was happy and free every day.

208
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,470
I want him to come back.

209
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,090
Is that okay?

210
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,830
Xiao Jin.

211
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,290
No, Coach Jin.

212
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,280
I'm really counting on you this time.

213
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
Thank you.

214
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,910
Auntie.

215
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,150
He ate it all.

216
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,330
That's great!

217
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,800
By the way, I have a favor to ask you.

218
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,200
Please don't tell the others what happened to Yu Yan.

219
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,230
He still has to train in LUU. I don't want people to point fingers at him behind his back.

220
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,840
I heard you and Li Yubing are dating.

221
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,850
I know he's your boyfriend.

222
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,110
But please don't tell him about Yan-yan, okay?

223
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,670
Well...

224
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,130
Okay. I won't tell.

225
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,740
Thank you.

Does that mean you don't want to give up yet?

231
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,190
Then you can start training again.

232
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,370
As we pursue our dreams, everyone will have times where they fall back along the way.

233
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,960
Forget your goal. Remember the time when you first started skating.

234
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,910
Remember what it was like to encounter the ice.

235
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:44,140
I'm not lacking money. This is a portion of my prize money, so just take it.

236
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,800
You're really willing to be my co-star?

237
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
It's like high jump or archery.

238
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,020
You step back so you can jump higher or shoot farther.

Can... I?

240
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,090
Once you decide to commit to something,

241
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,860
everyone will step aside and support you.

242
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,360
Yu Yan helped me so much.

243
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,000
But I didn't even realize he was sick.

244
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,260
Tang Xue, you are far from a good friend.

Where were you last night that you didn't come?

246
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,580
Last... minute... emergency. I went to look for you but you weren't there anymore.

247
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,920
You didn't answer my calls. I was working on the puzzle on my own.

248
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,570
You haven't finished, have you?

249
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,470
We said we'll finish it together. We'll continue tonight?

250
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,480
What? The training hasn't even started and you're worried that you won't be picked?

251
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,720
I'm so talented. The coach is not dumb.

252
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,580
Then, there's something on your mind?

253
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,620
I'm just a bit tired recently.

254
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,010
This is so odd. You just trained for a little bit and are leaving?

255
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,640
Yan-yan is not well today.

256
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,250
Can you come over if you're free?

257
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,210
I have to leave.

258
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,330
So soon?

259
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,170
So odd.

Brother Wei.

261
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,990
Why are you here?

262
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,820
Where is Tang Xue?

263
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,040
She just left to take care of something. What's up?

264
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,830
We said we'd leave together, why did she run off by herself again?

265
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,530
Maybe there's an emergency. She'll be back soon.

266
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,870
Then I'll get going.

When are you going to the training center?

277
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,110
I don't know yet. We're waiting for the notification. I think it should be soon.

278
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,400
How about you? Have you thought about the next step?

279
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,390
Don't mention it.

I read some books in sports management.

292
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,500
is your old back okay?

293
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,130
I'm not using my back. It's on my shoulder.

294
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,230
I'll help you.

295

- You...

296

297

- I'll do it myself.

307
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,540
Do I need to treat you to coffee? I'll just make you one.

308

311
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,920
His condition still isn't well but he's willing to eat.

312
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,810
Does he still stay in his room and refuse to come out?

313
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,600
How about this? I'll leave the house to run some errands after cleaning up.

314

You two can spend some time together.

315

Talk to him some more.

Auntie, you can go do your errands, I'll clean up here.

317

That won't be proper.

318
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,740
I did some research. We should let Yu Yan integrate back into life.

319
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,990
So he can think about different things and relax.

320

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:56,420
Little sheep, Yu Yan is ignoring me again today.

326
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,870
Is he nervous again?

327
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,410
Unhappy again?

328
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,110
I've learned a really good trick from books

329
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,430
to relieve nervousness. Want to try?

330
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,260
Curl your tongue and press against the roof of your mouth.

331
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,960
And then take a deep breath.

332
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,780
Breathe In, out.

333
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,270
In again.

334
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,710
Out again.

335
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,700
Any better?

336
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,510
Little sheep, since you are feeling better,

337
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,190
should we go for a walk?

338
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,550
Have some fun? Okay?

339
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,530
Stop talking like this. I'm not a kid.

340
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,660
Of course, you are not.

341
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,670
Then, can you go downstairs and help me?

342
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,600
Look! The sun is so nice outside.

343
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,800
Too bad it's sunset.

344
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,410
So what if it's sunset? It'll be sunrise after the sunset.

345
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,830
Help me with the laundry. They're too high.

346
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,440
Your clothes are so boring. Only a couple of colors.

347
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm always a boring person.

348
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,570
I don't have anything except figure skating.

349
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,010
Now not even figure skating...

350
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,540
What do you mean you don't have anything?

351
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,930
What about your mom? And me?

352
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,730
Are we just air?

353
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,560
Don't look at me. I'm air.

354
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,200
You started winning prizes when you were so little.

355
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,100
You must be tired of winning. But have you noticed?

356
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,390
The older you get, you look less happy and more serious in pictures.

357
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,800
Look! You were so happy winning when you were little.

358
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,630
I don't know why. I think I became less and less happy as I grew up.

359
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,050
Winning feels like finishing a task.

360
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,640
It's just so I don't disappoint my mom.

361
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,020
I'd have run away a long time ago

362
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,110
if I only did it for my mom instead of because I liked it.

363
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,360
I never thought of running away as a kid.

364
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,930
I just knew my mom would be happy

365
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,900
if I won and I'd be happy, too.

366
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,300
But as I grew up, I realized how much Mom has sacrificed for me.

367
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,780
She is both Mom and Dad.

368
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,100
She has to work and help with my training.

369
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,710
I always feel...

370
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,140
I'll disappoint her if I don't excel.

371
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,340
I don't want to disappoint her.

372
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,230
So, in the end, I felt more and more lost.

373
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,290
I didn't know why I skate. The more I wanted to figure it out,

374
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,450
the more I was confused.

375
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,100
Until I met you.

376
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,830
You are so unconstrained, so carefree,

377
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,910
so worry-free. You know what you want.

378
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,370
You want your short track speed skating. I was so envious.

379
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,570
Sit down. Take a deep breath.

380
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,210
Breathe in, out.

381
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,250
In, out.

382
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,980
Actually I wasn't so unconstrained and carefree in the beginning.

383
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,430
Do you still remember my dad coming to school and forcing me to quit?

384
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:16,460
I didn't understand then but now I do.

385
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,860
Actually,

386
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,200
my dad and your mom want the same thing.

387
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,050
They want the best for us. Maybe their approaches are not correct.

388
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:35,130
But there are no perfect parents. Their intentions are love.

389
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,720
They work really hard. They'd rather sacrifice themselves

390
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,560
for us to be healthy and happy.

391
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,400
Now you are not the Yu Yan I know.

392
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,340
The little sheep I know is like this.

393
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,940
See? He should be always like this.

394
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,660
Look! How happy his smile is.

395
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,920
I don't know what happened to me either.

396
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,000
I just feel like there's no hope for everything.

397
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,320
What do you mean by no hope?

398
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,000
In the future, you'll still be as happy as before.

399
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,830
But...

400
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,530
I've also seen you when you were most confident. You were on ice.

401
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:33,390
♫ Snowflakes are falling, do you see them? ♫

402
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:40,780
♫ Holding your hand so tightly, I’ll never be afraid ♫

403
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:47,560
♫ Snowflakes are falling, I’m so envious of them ♫

404
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,690
You were born for figure skating.

405
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,720
Look. Don't you look like a world champion?

406
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,010
Is it still possible for me?

407
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,910
He definitely can.

408
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,370
I don't know...

409
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,400
about the you right now.

410
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:25,440
♫ To me you are irreplaceable in this world ♫

411
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,040
♫ The you who resolutely said will protect me
has serious reasoning ♫

412
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,630
♫ In practicing love ♫

413
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,750
Sorry, sorry. Huan-huan needs me. I can't make it. Let's reschedule.

414
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:46,080
♫ The summer season filled with meteor showers
heard the star’s response ♫

415
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:53,860
♫ I opened my eyes and saw the two footprints
kissing the snowy ground ♫

416
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,220
The true image of XDragons Li Yubing.

417
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,290
One, he boasts his status as Ice God

418
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,280
and constantly dominates the LUU ice rink.

419
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,100
Forcing the XDragons figure skating team and

420
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,800
speed skating team to give up their training facility.

421
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,660
Second, he used threatening measures

422
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,150
to request XDragons Club to provide him a personal assistant.

423
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,570
He also used work as an excuse to abuse his assistant multiple times.

424
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,050
When the assistant requested to resign,

425
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,160
he maliciously set a high penalty of ¥50,000.

426
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,500
Third, he was arrogant on the National Youth Team.

427
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,700
He refused to cooperate with others and caused the China National Youth Team

428
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,900
to suffer a crushing defeat.

429
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,200
Four, Li Yubing and club manager, Ma Xiaoshan

430
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,440
have an unusual relationship,

431
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,000
raising suspicion.

432
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,660
Li Yubing, this article is for you.

433
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,870
I wish you good dreams tonight.

434
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,550
He must be asleep now.

435
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,800
You are back.

436
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,290
Tang Xue, you are back.

437
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,240
Why did you come back so late? Were you on a date again?

438
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,740
Hurry up and sleep soon.

439
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,340
- Good night.
- Good night.

440
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,210
You stood me up again. You want to settle it with just this?

441
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,880
I know I'm wrong. Please forgive me.

442
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,230
Your Old Ye and Consort Meng, you fly away as soon as they call you.

443
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,650
- Am I still your boyfriend?
- Of course you are!

444
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,920
If I favor you too much, they'll say I'm valuing my lover over my friends.

445
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,200
Value lover over friends? I think it's the complete opposite right now.

446
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,520
As your lover, I am very upset right now.

447
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,590
How can I make you happy,

448
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,030
my dear Ice God?

449
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,150
Are you done?

450
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,770
Fine, I'll let it go for today. But I'm telling you,

451
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,200
if you still don't show up, the puzzle is going to be done.

452
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,400
I really want to finish it with you.

453
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,430
Eat breakfast first.

454
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,860
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

455
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,030
It's so sweet.

456
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,810
What's happening?

457
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,410
They said the children's ick hockey club is visiting.

458
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,230
Kid, your shoelaces are untied.

459
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,070
Look. If the shoelaces are too long,

460
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,830
like hockey skates, wrap them around.

461
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,030
Here.

462
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,920
Tie them.

463
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,720
Finished.

464
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,270
Thank you, Uncle! Are you a hockey player?

465
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,220
Yes. I'm a lead player of XDragons.

466
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,800
How cool! Do you know brother Ice God?

467
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,350
Yes. He's my good bro and partner.

468
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,460
I don't believe you. How are you going to prove it?

469
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,820
You don't believe me? I'll show you.

470
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,780
Feet apart.

471
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,090
Lift the stick, shoot!

472
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,580
A puck.

473
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,450
For you.

474
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,660
You are so cool.

475
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,160
It's nothing. You just need to practice and you'll be as cool as me.

476
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,350
Teach me and I'll give you all my candy.

477
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,740
Is that okay, Uncle?

478
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,220
I can teach you under one condition.

479
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,240
Can you call me something else in the future?

480
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,840
How should I address you then?

481
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,440
For example, what did you Ice God? Ice God...?

482
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,110
I got it. I'll call you "Coach." I'll call you that from now on.

483
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,550
Okay.

484
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,300
Deal!

485
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,450
Coach?

486
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,850
Xiao Yu, where are you?

487
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,600
I'm in the classroom. I'm leaving soon.

488
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,780
In the classroom?

489
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,520
Well, well, Little Yuzi.

490
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,130
We haven't seen each other for a few days and you've learned to lie.

491
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,100
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just miss you.

492
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,010
I miss you, too. I'll hang out with you after I'm done with this busy season.

493
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,690
Sure. Go back to work then. We'll hang out later.

494
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,440
Bye-bye.

495
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,810
Little cutie, let's continue.
