00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,600
I had a very well-paid career,

160
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,300
but I would do some things that you really didn't like,

161
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,900
would you mind?

162
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,400
It depends on how much I don't like it, and why I don't like it.

163
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,500
Maybe I would go against the goals I started out with,

164
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
or feel like I've thrown away my dignity.

165
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,700
I can't tell you what to do.

166
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,400
Everyone has a list of priorities.

167
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,800
You will put the things that matter to you first.

168
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,100
As long as you ask yourself,

169
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,800
be it benefits, dignity,

170
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,200
goals, which of these would you put first?

171
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,100
Figure that out, make your decision, and don't regret it. That's all you need to do.

172
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,600
Then Wei-wei, if I...

173
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,200
choose to not become a professional hockey player,

174
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
would you think that I'm useless?

175
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
If you're not a professional athlete?

176
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
If there are other things that you think

177
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,100
are more important or can make you happier than playing hockey,

178
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,900
then I believe you have your own reasons.

179
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
Also, this is just a choice.

180
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Why would I think that you were useless?

181
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,230
Maybe my life is just normal.

182
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
Not like you.

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600
How am I not normal?

184
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Just because I stood on the award podium a few times?

185
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
I try my best to become a champion

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
not because being the champion isn't normal.

187
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
It's because short track speed skating makes me happy.

188
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,600
From that perspective,

189
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,200
normal or amazing,

190
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
neither of these things affects happiness.

191
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,600
As long as you are happy

192
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,500
and do what you love,

193
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,900
that's what is most important. Isn't that right?

194
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,700
You're right.

195
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,600
You're recovering well. It's so good to be young.

196
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,100
You really can't tell that he just had surgery.

197
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh right. Thank you, Doctor Qi.

198
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
When can I get discharged?

199
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
It won't help if you rush it. We need to take it slow.

200
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,900
But I want to start training again soon.

201
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,900
You can't start training yet. You need to focus on recovering fully.

202
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,400
But if I don't train, I'm afraid I'll fall beh–

203
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay, okay! I won't train. I'll rest.

204
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It truly is that everything has a weakness.

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,600
Hurry and get discharged. I can't watch this anymore either.

206
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,500
The hockey tournament is over. The Bears team won against the Black Scorpions team.

207
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,580
Song Anjie was amazing.

208
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,300
You could say he took revenge for you.

209
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,700
I knew this bro would do well in the future.

210
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,900
If I don't train, I'll fall too far behind him.

211
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,460
What did we just say? You're not listening again?

212
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,780
If I listen obediently, what reward will I get?

213
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300
How annoying.

It's because of every single one of you that we have today's XDragons hockey team.

Today, the XDragons team isn't the strongest team in the nation yet.

Why did you come out?

239
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,900
Originally, Big Jiang and I agreed to go visit you later. How come you got discharged?

240
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,900
That's right. I'm almost fully recovered and there's nothing to do today

241
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,400
so I came to visit the brothers.

242
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,100
If not for the doctor's disapproval, he'd probably nag to be discharged today.

I understand.

290
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,800
Because I'm injured,

291
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,360
so the team won't always wait for me. Right?

292

Yubing, don't worry.

I'll help you reach your athletic peak after you recover.

I came for you.

299

Is it because you can't find a player that has more chemistry?

300

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,180
- I'm leaving to go practice.
- All right.

318
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,550
Song Anjie?

319
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,130
He joined XDragons

320
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,880
because the club needs a talented player, so...

321
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,320
It's so sudden.

322
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,390
Oh right. Why did Coach Chu call you?

323
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,770
Your acceptance letter came?

324
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,610
Well...

325
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,340
It's just that I've been doing great recently so she praised me.

326
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,640
All right. Let's go then.

327
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,210
[Boss Zhen]

328
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,060
Hello.

329
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,780
Have you decided? Let's meet up.

330
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,170
Okay. I was going to look for you.

331
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,680
Let's meet then.

332
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,460
I've seen the report.

333
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,550
Li Yubing, you can get discharged tomorrow.

334
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,520
He can get discharged.

335
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,510
Then, Doctor Qi, can I start training?

336
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,140
You should take care of yourself first.

337
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,710
You can't have any intense training for the next few months.

338
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,230
We'll see how the situation goes and then start training professionally.

339
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,510
Then, can I recover to my original condition?

340
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,370
This... no one can guarantee.

341
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,320
It's fine. I think as long as I do rehab,

342
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,250
I can definitely go back to my original condition. Don't worry.

343
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:17,240
As long as you're healthy then there's nothing for us to worry about.

344
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,890
Don't worry, Auntie. I'll watch him and not let him do anything reckless.

345
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,750
Follow the doctor's orders and proceed gradually.

346
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,130
The level of your nagging is becoming more and more like my mom.

347
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,590
Doctor Xu, come one. You be the fair one.

348
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,240
I envy you.

349
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,840
In the future, you don't have to worry about the relationship between your wife and mother.

350
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,760
Have you read the contract?

351
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,750
I read it.

352
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,640
The pay is indeed generous.

353
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,880
So your answer is?

354
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,810
No.

355
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,860
You're not afraid that you won't have a future?

356
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,690
I'm afraid. How can I not be afraid?

357
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,770
But I'm more afraid of you who doesn't have a bottom line.

358
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,450
I'll tell you how to not be afraid.

359
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,960
You have to be friends with scary people.

360
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,650
Simply being a nice person doesn't help in some cases.

361
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,330
Old man, I know it was you who did it.

362
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,390
So what? Do you have evidence?

363
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,900
I don't have evidence,

364
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,980
but I believe

365
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,520
justice might arrive late,

366
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,790
but it's never absent.

367
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,190
With how you are, do you think other professional teams will use you?

368
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,700
You only know how to hit people. What else can you do?

369
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,080
Jiang Shijia only plays hockey.

370
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,330
- I don't hit people.
- So annoying!

371
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,410
Is that Song Anjie close with you?

372
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,760
We're pretty close.

373
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,960
We can be called as former comrades.

374
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,880
He's a very skilled center, too.

375
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,040
Well, don't overthink it.

376
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,940
With my current state, the XDragons team needs a strong center

377
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,990
to carry the burden.

378
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,180
I'm still a member of the XDragons.

379
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,390
If they didn't want me anymore, I'd know by now.

380
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,880
Don't worry.

381
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,720
It's getting late. You should go back and rest.

382
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,080
Go. I'll make sure to eat the walnuts.

383
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,850
Oh right.

384
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,380
Can you turn off the lights for me?

385
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,110
[National Women's Short Track Speed Skating Team (8):
Zhang Yuewei, Tang Xue]

386
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,780
How should I tell him?

387
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,300
Then can I recover to my original condition?

388
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,200
Can I really recover?

389
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,080
You will.

390
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,780
I'm scared.

391
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,530
Think about the bravest person in your heart.

392
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,400
Even if you can recover,

393
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,160
but the team doesn't need you anymore.

394
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,730
They already have Song Anjie now.

395
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,310
He will take your place.

396
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,560
Before long,

397
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,530
all your teammates will like him.

398
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,520
What's wrong with that?

399
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,690
He's my brother, too.

400
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,700
You'll become an extra person.

401
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,840
I won't. I won't. I won't!

402
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,970
♫ Could it be that if we continue, it’s destined to be a game? ♫

403
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:17,190
♫ Insisting on distinguishing the ups and downs
to make me lose so thoroughly ♫

404
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,790
♫ The ending is never close to people's expectations ♫

405
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,000
♫ Why force myself to be infatuated with you? ♫

406
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,170
You can't have any intense training for the next few months.

407
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,020
We'll see how the situation goes and then start training professionally.

408
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,530
Then, can I recover to my original condition?

409
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,950
This... no one can guarantee.

410
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,620
Master Tang,

411
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,650
you're not sleeping and just sitting here alone.

412
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,340
Don't you know that it's scary?

413
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,060
Between your dream and love, which one would you choose?

414
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,520
My dream first.

415
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,260
Why?

416
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,610
If you give up love for your dream then you'll get your dream,

417
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,760
but if you give up your dream for your love

418
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,230
then in the end, you might not get anything. What do you think?

419
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,650
It's a paradox.

420
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,800
Can you change your habit of scaring people?

421
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,590
Why can't you choose both?

422
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,720
That's right. I won't give up any of them,

423
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,220
but what's important right now is his health.

424
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,440
Auntie and Uncle.

425
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,290
The discharge papers are finished. We can leave now.

426
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,480
Tang Xue, it must've been tough for you these few days.

427
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,190
You still have class. Go back and teach first.

428
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,340
I'll stay for a bit longer to take care of him.

429
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,850
Mom, didn't you say that you guys were going back? Why did you suddenly go back on your words?

430
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,030
I can take care of myself. Moreover, there's Tang Xue.

431
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,980
You can't always trouble Tang Xue. Here.

432
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,030
Don't be so polite.

433
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,500
He's willing to let Tang Xue take care of him, right?

434
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,350
Then we'll go back to Hucheng.

435
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,130
Xiao Xue, keep an eye on him for me.

436
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,420
Don't worry, Auntie. When we go back to school other than teachers and classmates,

437
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,340
there's also teammates and coaches that are there.

438
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,360
I know you don't like peeling walnuts.

439
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,820
I already peeled them for you. Remember to eat some every day.

440
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,520
They all say that walnuts help the brain.

441
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,790
It'll be useful no matter what, so remember to eat them.

442
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,650
Xiao Xue, watch him and remind him to eat them.

443
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,810
After we leave, remember to take care of yourself.

444
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,350
Eat well.

445
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,710
I know. Don't worry, I'll take care of myself.

446
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,320
You must pay attention to your health, too.

447
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,780
Silly child. If you're well,

448
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,220
then we're all well.

449
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,870
Come on, Li Yubing finally got discharged today.

450
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,700
Let's all raise our glasses to celebrate Yubing for returning.

451
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,490
Cheers!

452
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,920
Eat up.

453
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,560
Coach.

454
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,360
Did you catch the people who beat up Li Yubing?

455
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,020
Not yet.

456
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,470
Mr. Zhen talked to me.

457
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,370
I can tell that Li Yubing's injuries had something to do with him.

458
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,090
Does that mean that you're signing on for the Black Scorpions Team?

459
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,200
Joining a professional team is appealing.

460
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,880
But I can't play against my conscience.

461
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,660
Big Jiang.

462
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,890
I admire you.

463
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,530
Am I man enough?

464
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,630
This one is for all of you. Thank you, everyone.

465
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,510
You all supported me after so many things happened.

466
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,950
Coach Xu, this is for you.

467
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,090
Thank you for bringing hockey into my life

468
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,460
which became one of my life goals.

469
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,210
There's also Big Jiang and all the brothers.

470
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,240
It's been the happiest two years of my life when I've played with you guys.

471
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,010
Here. To our team doctor assistant, Liao Zhenyu.

472
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,430
You sent me to the hospital twice.

473
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,780
Thank you for sending me there on time.

474
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,720
New teammate, Song Anjie.

475
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,900
You are my role model.

476
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,590
In the future, we'll be brothers who are fighting together.

477
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,560
Other brothers, don't worry. I'll recover and come back as soon as possible.

478
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,120
I will let those know that as long as I don't completely collapse,

479
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,860
once I'm back, I'll show them what I got.

480
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,720
XDragons are the best!

481
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,150
Cheers!

482
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,000
[Xu Feng]

483
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,020
But on the journey to fulfilling one's dreams, it's arduous, perhaps even very cruel.

484
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,720
- You won't shrink back, right?
- Have you cowered back into fear?

485
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,530
In my dictionary, there's no such phrase as "shrinking back"!

486
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,480
Then we must be using the same dictionary.

487
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,050
Looking good. But you must remember these words you said to me today.

488
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,720
In the future, no matter what difficulties or setbacks, don't shrink back.

489
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,330
Your dream is to prove to the world what Chinese Hockey athletes can do.

490
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,020
Endure to the end, and then success will definitely come.

491
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,310
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

492
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:12,680
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

493
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:19,360
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

494
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,640
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

495
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,850

you are giving me ♫

496

498
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,510
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

499
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,520
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

500
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,810
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

501
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,730
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

502
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:07,750
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

503
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:14,260
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

504
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:20,520
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

505
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,090
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

506
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:33,540
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

507
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,640
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

508
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:47,050
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

509
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:53,580
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

510
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:59,640
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

511
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,770
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

512
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:12,790
