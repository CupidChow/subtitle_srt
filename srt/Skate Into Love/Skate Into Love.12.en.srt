Do you know why I punished you guys?

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,120
From the day you guys joined the national youth team,

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,430
you are no longer from a specific university or a specific club.

We need soldiers and we need a general. Each with their own duty.

Let's go and come back quickly, I still need to make training plans for the team later.

I'm eating dinner with Xiao Xia tonight.

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,310
Should we bring some dog food (leftovers) back for you?

No need, you guys go ahead.

What's wrong with him? He doesn't seem like himself.

58
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,070
Maybe he's worried about Li Yubing.

Coach Jin, you're still here.

I want to discuss Yu Yan with you.

63
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,700
But I have an appointment with a lady today.

64
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,500
But this is a very urgent matter.

65
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,550
How urgent?

66
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,310
It's okay, Yu Yan is more important. Old Jin, why don't we go eat another time?

67
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,610
I knew Coach Chu would understand.

68
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,340
- Xiao Xia, listen to me. Xiao Xia...
- Another time.

69
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,250
Coach Jin.

70
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,260
Are you trying to make me stay single forever?

71
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,080
Recently, haven't you discovered Yu Yan is not the same?

72
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,290
He seems the same. Yu Yan has always been someone with few words.

73
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,220
Coach Jin, you are really obtuse.

74
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,950
Your emotional reflexes are so slow...

75
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,050
You could circle the earth three times before you realized what's going on.

76
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,150
Haven't you noticed that recently, Yu Yan is always with Tang Xue from the short track speed skating team?

77
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,310
I'm not being a gossip. I'm just concerned that Yu Yan won't be able

78
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,110
to focus on training because of Tang Xue, and that it will hurt his performance.

79
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,400
I really haven't noticed that. But in terms of practice,

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,020
Yu Yan has always trained very diligently and he hasn't slacked off.

81
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,410
That's good then.

82
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm not trying to nag, but for a star athlete like Yu Yan, we need to be more careful. Right?

83
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,320
It'll be better for the club's publicity in the future.

84
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,110
That's it?

85
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,150
It was just this little matter?

86
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,440
Our Coach Jin has worked hard.

87
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,720
You ruined my life.

88
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,740

89
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,660

How come you're here? Sit, sit.

91
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,040
Yubing didn't get chosen as the national youth team captain this time.

92
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,440
If he didn't get chosen, it's not a big deal.

93
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,570
Captains and teammates are the same, they just need to focus on playing well.

94
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,850
I don't care about whether he got chosen, I care about why he didn't get chosen.

95
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,920
His technical stats say he only knows how to breakthrough individually,

96
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,300
he doesn't know how to organize the entire team.

97
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,160
They said he's not a good center forward. This is clearly my fault for being a bad coach.

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,270
Li Yubing would have to go through this sooner or later.

100
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,550
You went through it, too. He definitely can, too.

101
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,390
That's true.

102
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,450
Right! Weren't you going to eat with Coach Jin?

103
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,940
Yeah, but you interfered with it.

104
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,370
I have stewed pork ribs at home, how about...

105
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,300
Pork ribs again?

106
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,380
Although I haven't had it in so long, I actually want to eat it again.

107
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,600
Let's go.

108
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,380
Tang Xue!

109
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,760
Yu Yan.

110
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,780
You practice extra every day? How can you hold up training this much?

111
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,380
It's all thanks to you for teaching me how to relax.

112
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,960
Now that I can relax my body, my performance is a lot better.

113
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,140
I'm glad I could help.

114
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,690
Oh right. Tomorrow's the weekend, do you have any plans?

115
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,970
Practice. What about you?

116
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,740
I want to see a movie.

117
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,310

118
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,570

119
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,990

120
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,310
I haven't seen a movie in years.

121

I just want to go and see a movie.

Do you have time to come with me tomorrow?

123
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,460
Sure. Then I'll watch the movie with you in the morning and train in the afternoon.

124
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,960
Let's go.

125
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,150
- Hi, Coach Jin.
- Have you seen Coach Chu?

126
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,840
I saw her talking with Coach Xu on the track field. They were talking pretty animatedly.

127
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,090
I think something's going on with them. They might get back together–

128
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,770
Nonsense!

129
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,330
Just after talking for a little bit, they'll get back together?

130
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,230
You're too young.

131
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,930
Let me tell you, just focus on training.

132
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,340
Don't observe your coaches all the time. You hear? You can go now.

133
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,190
Okay, then I'll head out. Bye, Coach Jin.

134
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,590
Okay.

135
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,410
No way.

136
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,740
How's this one? "Player Two." Just from the title it sounds pretty good.

137
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,050
I think it sounds kind of boring.

138
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,080
What about this one? This Murderer Is Not Calm.

139

He'll say excited first.

If I can't even do it, you shouldn't bother wasting your money.

160
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
I just want to try it.

161
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,220
I'll let you try it, just to say you did it.

162
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,610
♫  it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

163
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,490
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

164
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,620
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

165
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,770
You guys were way too slow.

166
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,160
And the defensemen are completely disconnected.

167
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,680
Defensemen, you guys can't keep up.

168
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,020
There's no urgency.

169
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,670
The game is coming up soon; we have no chance of winning with this kind of attitude.

170
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,770
Bing-bing, score a few more goals. Make us brothers proud.

171
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,580
Take care of yourself.

172
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,660
Just get the puck and score more points, that's all you need to do.

173
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,550
I told you not to get so many. This is so wasteful.

174
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,120
Do you know how cheap these things are at the market?

175
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,980
This kid doesn't even know how to use a smartphone.

176
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,050
How come he's so good at playing the claw machines?

177
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,340
- Hello?
- Hello?

178
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,660
Yu Yan, hold this for a second.

179
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,950
Hello?

180
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,210
What's wrong?

181
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,190
Li Yubing probably butt-dialed me.

182
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,770
Which ones of these do you want? Pick some.

183
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,360
I just want this one.

184
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,160
This one?

185
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Okay, give me the rest then.

186
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,790
I'll head up now.

187
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,220
What's this?

188
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,010
- Where did you get–
- Yu Yan got them from the claw machine.

189
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,680
Don't drop them.

190
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,520
- Where are these from?
- Let me tell you!

191
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,340
Geniuses are geniuses in everything.

192
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,130
Can you believe this is his first time playing a claw machine?

193
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,610
Seriously?

194
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,080
Yu Yan?

195
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,030
Yu Yan? Yu Yan is good! I support it.

196
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,420
Support what?

197
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,950
I support you guys dating.

198
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,130
Don't be ridiculous. He's just a kid.

199
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,880
Then you are volunteering to care for children left behind.

200
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,120
It's just because since Yu Yan was little,

201
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,410
he always trained and never got to have a childhood like we did.

202
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,540
As an older sister, I'm just helping him to

203
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,730
make up his missed childhood.

204
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,610
Fallen petals have the intention to follow the brook.

205
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,670
However, the brook is uninterested

206
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,270
- to love the fallen petals.
- Don't read so much when using the restroom.

207
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,360
Which one do you want? Pick any of them.

208
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,240
Mine.

209
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,990

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,260

211
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,940
I only like this one.

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,340
Why do you want mine? This cat is mine.

213
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,210

214
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,230

220

You know your mom has placed all her expectations on you.

221
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,560
She wants you to focus on training and become the world champion.

222
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,100
She doesn't want to see you distracted by other things and forget about figure skating.

223
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,420
I haven't. I'm still training diligently.

Wow, you're already at this point?

How is it? Is it okay?

229
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,960
This is so impressive. How did you find this place?

230
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,210
I heard our department chair is always feeding stray cats around here.

231
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,660
So I sought him out and told him about our plan. I didn't expect he strongly supported the idea.

232
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,230
He even requested the school to give us this area.

233
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,030
You're incredible.

234
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,070
It's not much. Come in and see if there's anything we can improve.

235

What's wrong with your hand?

237
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,880
It's just a scrape; nothing major.

238
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,160
Let me see.

239
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,680
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,960

Today you're 190cm.

243
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,780
I'm going to paint the inside walls again, then I'll add the furniture and it'll be like new.

I'll help you.

We finally finished painting.

249
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,490
Now, we just need to wait for the Home for Homeless Babies to officially open.

250
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,890
Thank you for making this happen.

251
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,760
Your cat is so cute.

252

This?

253
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,130
Master Tang gave it to me.

254
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,200
Did I hear it wrong? Master Tang doesn't like that kind of thing.

255
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,840
Yu Yan got her a ton of plushies from the claw machine. She gave all of them to me and Ye Liuying.

256
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,550
What a waste of his energy. She gave them all away.

257
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,130
I think Master Tang is a better fit with Li Yubing.

258
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,570
Li Yubing?

259
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,570
He's such an overbearing guy. Yu Yan is so much better. He's sweet and gentle.

260
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:27,130
Yes, he is gentle. He's so gentle that he can barely stand on his own.

261

Guys like Yu Yan, that can bring out a girl's maternal side,

263

is perfect for girls like Master Tang, who has a strong desire to protect.

264
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,500
Let me tell you... This is because girls don't understand.

265
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,860
Master Tang's personality is one that has to be conquered.

266
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,450
Yu Yan can't do it. It has to be Li Yubing.

267
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,530
Why can't Yu Yan do it? He's clearly the better choice.

Li Yubing, conquer? Please.

How about this? Let's make a bet.

We'll bet on whether Master Tang will like Yu Yan or Li Yubing in the end. Do you dare?

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,810
U20 Invitational Tournament. Li Yubing is in it.

318
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,230
Remeber to watch my game.

319
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,480
Waiting to watch your game.

320
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
Good luck!

321
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,390
Good luck!

322
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,550
This is the Sino-Korean Youth Ice Hockey Invitational Tournament

323
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,310
U20 level game. This is also

324
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,790
the China Youth Team versus Korea Youth Team.

325
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,800
- Will Li Yubing play?
- Yeah.

326
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,930
Where is he?

327
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,060
That one.

328
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,940
The camera is from such a long distance, everyone looks the same yet you can tell right away it's him?

329
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,180
In my eyes, he always has a dog head.

330
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,670
Team China is attacking from the left. Team Korea from the right.

331
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,430
Now a special introduction of No. 19, Li Yubing.

332
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,630
It's his first time on the national youth team.

333
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,730
From his performance in the college ice hockey league,

334
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,870
he's skilled with distinctive features. He has a swift movement on ice.

335
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,830
Li Yubing, give your best! Everyone is watching.

336
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,620
Ready for the face-off is the captain of Team China, Song Anjie.

337
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,550
Li Yubing, go get them.

338
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,290
Only two minutes left. The score is 2 to 3 right now.

339
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,160
China Youth Team is one point behind.

340
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,830
Go for it, our young hockey players!

341
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,940
As long as you can make it to overtime, there's a chance to win.

342
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,980
You can do it, Li Yubing.

343
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,010
- Pass! Left!
- Left!

344
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,140
Song Anjie, shoulder-checking, forces a way out.

345
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,300
Coach Wang trained him well. He didn't let us down.

346
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,290
There's a gap! Chance! Pass the puck!

347
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,190
- Pass it! 
- Pass the puck!

348
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,890
Pass!

349
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,370
- Pass!
- Pass it!

350
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,480
Time is up. Game over.

351
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,550
China Youth Team lost the game by one point.

352
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,270
We hope the team regains their confidence soon after losing the first game.

353
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,130
At the same time, improve cooperation with the team. Guard against arrogance and rashness.

354
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:39,100
Right. We hope in the near future the young players will make us proud.

355
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,180
You really consider yourself an Ice God?

356
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,360
He wasted such a perfect opportunity.

357
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,100
Hey!

358
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,170
Losing a game is not just your problem. It's our problem.

359
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,900
But you don't trust us, your teammates. That's your problem.

360
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,800
Ice God.

361
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,980
You yourself don't even know how much you care about him.

362
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,920
[Zhang Yuewei]

363
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,390
Hello.

364
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,500
It's normal to lose a game. Don't take it too personally.

365
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,810
I know. I'm okay.

366
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,970
Really?

367
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,080
Don't worry. You know me.

368
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,710
I'm not easily defeated.

369
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,050
I'm going to rest. Goodnight.

370
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,550
Goodnight.

371
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,790
I watched the game. Overall you played well.

372
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,250
I just need to knock on your dog head. Why didn't you pass?

373
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,040
You wasted several good chances.

374
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,560
Dog, it's okay to lose.

375
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,240
Failure proceeds win. There's always the next game.

376
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:01,070
I think you just don't trust your teammates. You should have passed the puck.

377
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,690
Trust...

378
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,060
Li Yubing, did you take pity on Team Korea?

379
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,790
You have to change next time.

380
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,320
Your last attack.

381
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,010
Why didn't you pass the puck?

382
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,030
Where's the chemistry with your teammates?

383
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,140
- I'll say...
- Old Jiang, I'm reflecting.

384
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,150
But I'm waiting for a call.

385
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,130
I'll talk to you later.

386
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,270
- Bye.
- Hello?

387
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
[Xiao Xue]

388
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,000
Who placed the phone here? Who's calling at this time?

389
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,200
- Xiao Xue?
- It's Xiao Xue.

390
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,200
Hello? My daughter, did something happen?

391
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,600
You were expecting me to get into trouble?

392
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,700
No, it's not like... It's quite late and you called so I thought... Hey!

393
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,000
Xiao Xue, did you spend all of your money again?

394
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Don't worry, I didn't.

395
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Then, did you miss us?

396
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,700
You should trust me when I say it.

397
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,200
Okay, back to business.

398
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,800
Are my elementary school photo albums still there?

399
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,700
Photo albums? Yes, they're still there. They're in a box under your bed.

400
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,800
What's wrong?

401
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,000
Then, Mother, please help me with a small favor.

402
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,400
Can you send them to my school tomorrow?

403
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,200
Losing a game is not just your problem. It's our problem.

404
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,200
But you don't trust us, your teammates.

405
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,600
That's your problem. Ice God.

406
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,400
How's Li Yubing doing lately?

407
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,700
Don't mention it. He's still sulking because of the loss.

408
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,300
He...

409
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,100
just asks too much from himself. Competing with himself every day.

410
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,900
That... Bing-bing

411
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,100
doesn't have friends since he's in a new environment so he will feel helpless.

412
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,400
Don't worry too much. He is strong enough.

413
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,400
He'll be back on track once he gets used to it.

414
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,600
Do you think we should...

415
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,100
do something for him?

416
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,400
Do what? What can we do?

417
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,500
All we can do is to secretly watch him from over here.

418
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,600
Secretly watching over him?

419
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,800
Okay.

420
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,700
Today, we'll do one-on-one training. Everyone, split into pairs.

421
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,100
Captain, come over here for a sec.

422
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,200
Pair up!

423
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This is the record of our recent training.

424
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You can see...

425
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,000
Let's go.

426
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,300
Have a bite.

427
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,200
Then, go back to your home.

428
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Shortie doesn't know when it's time to stop eating.

429
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,300
What are you doing?

430
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,700
Classmate, come here! Classmate, come here!

431
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,200
Come here quickly.

432
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,800
This is a wonderful moment. Now let's welcome our founder,

433
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,600
Xia Menghuan, to unveil Home for Homeless Babies.

434
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,100
Ready!

435
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,100
Three, two, one! Unveiling!

436
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,800
[Home for Homeless Babies]

437
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,200
I'm here to announce that Home for Homeless Babies officially opens.

438
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's welcome our founder, Xia Menghuan, to say a few words.

439
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,600
I have something to say.

440
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,800
Thank you, classmates, for actively volunteering.

441
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
For the creation of Home for Homeless Babies, I have to especially thank one person.

442
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,400
Liao Zhenyun from the Medical School.

443
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,900
He handmade these

444
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,400
shabby shelters for our homeless babies.

445
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,300
Also, we're giving big thanks to our Master Tang!

446
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
Starting today,

447
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,500
- we'll become angels for these homeless babies.
- Okay!

448
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,600
From now, I'm also

449
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,300
the Master Tang of these homeless babies.

450
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Didi? Didi, play on your own.

451
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,700
So pretty.

452
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,200
Mater Tang, petting a dog?

453
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,800
What is it?

454
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,500
If you have time, shouldn't you focus on your major courses?

455
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,800
You've already delayed many courses.

456
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,500
Especially the ones from Hawkeye. If you continue to delay them,

457
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,400
what if you don't pass, your graduation will be a problem.

458
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,300
But, Sister Huan,

459
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,800
right now, there is only one thing important to me.

460
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,400
To officially join the speed skating team.

461
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,700
So, the rest of the homework,

462
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,900
lectures, attendance. I'll leave them to you, okay?

463
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,800
Right? Let's tell Huan-huan, "right." Let's cheer her on.

464
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,100
Pinch my philtrum for me.
(T/N: traditional way to bring back one's consciousness)

465
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,900
Pinch my philtrum for me.

466
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,600
I've made a horrible friend.

467
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,200
Oh right! You got a delivery at noon. I helped you put it on the table.

468
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,700
Why didn't you say so earlier?

469
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,300
- Hey!!
- Master Tang.

470
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,500
Master Tang!

471
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,300
Where is she going?

472
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,700
I told her she had a delivery.

473
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,200
So exaggerated. I thought she needed to use the restroom.

474
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,700
Finally, I received it.

475
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,800
Coach Wang, are you looking for me?

476
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,200
Come.

477
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,700
What happened between you and the other team members?

478
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,800
Perhaps because I didn't pass the critical puck. They aren't happy with me.

479
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,600
Then, how do you see it?

480
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,500
They don't understand me well enough.

481
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,000
My strength is to attack and I'm a good shot.

482
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,400
I didn't perform well last game. But for the next game,

483
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,700
I'll prove it to everyone.

484
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,900
You didn't perform well?

485
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,400
Li Yubing, you still don't understand.

486
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,500
You are not playing table tennis. Do you think you can do it alone?

487
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,300
I don't understand.

488
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,200
Should I pass the puck to someone who can't score as well as me?

489
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,800
Your individual skills are better than other people.

490
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,600
But do you think other people are useless?

491
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
If you don't understand how to work together,

492
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,900
that means you're not fully mature.

493
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,000
You haven't met the standard to be on the national youth team.

494
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,600
A person changes not because of other people.

495
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,200
You are in charge of your own changes.

496
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,000
Go back and think about it.

497
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,800
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

498
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:43,200
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

499
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,700

500

503
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,200
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t

504
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,000
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

505
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto
the secrets you are protecting ♫

506
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

507
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,200
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

508
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:38,200
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

509
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,800
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

510
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,000
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

511
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,500
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

512
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,900
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are the four seasons that belong to me ♫

513
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:10,100
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

514
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:17,400
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

515
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,000
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t believe it
and tears came to my eyes ♫

516
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

517
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,300
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

518
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:43,200
♫ it is the signal you are giving me ♫

519
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,400
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

520
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:56,800
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

521
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,000
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

522
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,200
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫
