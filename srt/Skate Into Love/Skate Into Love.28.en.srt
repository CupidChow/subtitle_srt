Yes, it was me that told Bian Cheng.

If you want to tell Grandmother or Aunt, go ahead.

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,360
I just think it's odd. I've never done anything to you that has wronged you.

I've searched my heart and there's nothing.

What do you mean? Be clear.

36
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,270
Someone who has been the center of attention since they were young,

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,750
was the person who was coddled; how can you see other people's disappointments?

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,470
You're right. You did wrong me.

39
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,100
Since we were young until now, whether in the family or out,

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,540
the center of attention has always been you. As long as you have a competition,

41
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,180
the whole family was involved in keeping up the fighting spirit.
(T/N: idiom - move troops and stir up the people)

Who paid attention when I brought home those certificates for being an outstanding student?

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,260
It was you who stole all the praise and concern that belonged to me.

46
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,950
I still want to ask you.

47
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,430
How am I inferior to you? Why should I have to live in your shadow?

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,690
But I never tried to steal anything away from you.

49
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,590
But, in reality, you did steal it from me.

50
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,030
So, I really hate you.

51

Karma will eventually come back to bite you, Heaven won't let anyone go.

Brother Bing, you were something this time.

53
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,210
Are you still praising him? Bing-bing almost punched someone.

54
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,330
If he'd really punched him, he'd have been suspended from the competition.

I never realized before that Bian Cheng was that kind of person.

He's trying to accomplish something by fair means or foul.

Huan-huan, if you encounter someone like that in the future,

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,820
you'll have to stop me. I'm afraid I'd beat him to death.

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,190
Don't worry. I'll definitely restrain that person. I'm afraid you might be beaten to death.

61
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,190
Brother Bing, that's called charging in fury on behalf of a beautiful woman.

62
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,640
What's wrong, Master Tang. You're still not happy?

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,940
I was thinking that the reason Zhou Ran was biased against me for so many years was because of that.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,830
Shakespeare said, "Be careful of jealousy.

65
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,570
It's a green-eyed monster."

66
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,260
Zhou Ran is jealous of you.

67
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,340
I'm afraid it's because she very much wants to become someone like you.

68
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,720
Old Deng here performed an excellent service by catching the person manipulating from behind the scenes.

Why do you two pick at each other every time you meet?

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,900
You're registered.

82
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,800
Who asked you to concern yourself with my business?

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,010
What I want to say to you is this.

84
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,870
Since I was young until now, you've always been the

85
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,240
outstanding student with outstanding character in the eyes of the family.

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,430
In other kids' eyes, you're a kid from a different family.

87
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,910
You've never lacked young men pursuing you.

88
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,830
So, since I was young, I never got out from behind your shadow either.

89
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,300
From now on, please curb your arrogance; don't snatch away the praise that belongs to me.

(T/N: cousins are considered siblings)

Look at your petty expression.

92
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,520
For this season, our most competitive opponent,

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,470
a strong team from the same city as us, the Black Scorpions.

94
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,540
Their attack style is strong, tough, unyielding, and vicious.

95
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,480
They are especially skilled at collisions and power plays.

96
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,650
So, we must be prepared in advance.

97
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,280
To face this kind of opponent, everyone, tell me how should it be done?

98
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,770
Strength meets strength. Just do it.

99
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,100

100
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,540
Comprehensive defense to achieve a tie.

101
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,840
Even more incorrect. Avoid their spearhead; strike where the enemy is unprepared: Are the best methods.

102
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,830
Yubing, you're always the one doing the major attacks.

103
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,030
So you could say, when your group is attacking, you absolutely must not charge on impulse.

104
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,370
You must find a screen to complete a good pass to a teammate.

105
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,770
The first group completes its attack,

106
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,660
the second group, the third group, the fourth group

107
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,550
must continue to maintain this method.

108
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,350
Do your best to exhaust their energies and give Yubing time to create our best opportunities.

109
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,430
Understood?

110
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,670
- Yes.
- We understand.

111
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,550
Don't worry. I won't let everyone down.

112
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,510
That's exactly the attitude I need from you.

113
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,400
Yubing, you'll be responsible for the attack.

114
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,770
- Jiang Shijia, you take two people to be responsible for defense.
- Okay.

115
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,420
We'll practice this attack and defense on half-court.

116

Come on.

I brought you snacks and you were made fun of.

320
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,570
I'm not talking about that.

321
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm not angry at you either. I'm angry at myself.

322
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,440
All this time, you've been focusing on me.

323
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,830
You helped with whatever I wanted.

324
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,450
I've wanted to tell you something for a while.

325
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,230
It's my fault. I should have said it earlier.

326
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,550
In short, I think I'm pulling you behind.

327
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,170
Huan-huan, what do you mean?

328
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,170
Are you breaking up with me?

329
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,680
Huan-huan, I don't want to. Where did I make a mistake? Tell me. I'll correct myself. I really can.

330
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,790
I'm not breaking up with you, Xiao Yu.

331
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,210
You do everything for me.

332
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,060
You spend all your time on me.

333
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,910
Home for Homeless Babies, our home

334
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,490
has nothing to do with your dream.

335
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,090
What about your dream? What is the dream of your life?

336
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,380
I'm already a medical student at LUU.

337
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,890
After I graduate and start interning, I'll naturally become a doctor.

338
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,260
Is it that easy?

339
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,240
You almost failed the last semester. Are you going to be the same this semester?

340
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,980
You spend all your time on me. Right? When do you study?

341
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,030
Not to even mention your dream of becoming a doctor,

342
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,990
it's even difficult for you to graduate, you know?

343
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,770
- It's not that serious.
- Yes, it is. It's very serious right now.

344
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,330
I don't want our relationship to stand in the way of your future, do you understand?

345
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,730
I think Master Tang and Li Yubing have a very good relationship model.

346
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,430
They are after their goals respectively. They help and encourage each other.

347
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,870
I think we can do the same.

348
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,470
Frankly, I need a boyfriend right now who can reach our goals together.

349
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,200
Not a lackey.

350
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,360
Let's cool down for some time. Find me when you've thought it through.

351
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,050
Huan-huan, I...

352
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,370
From now on, stop following me.

353
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,860
I'll break up with you immediately if you follow me.

354
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,900
Was I too mean to him? Am I making things worse?

355
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,200
Strong medicine for tough illness.

356
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:36,040
Huan-huan, do you feel like you have to help Xiao Yu with his growth and maturity recently?

357
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,150
When he makes a mistake, do you feel worse than when you are the one making the mistake?

358
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,800
When he falls... no, he takes detours. It pains you more than when you fall.

359
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,660
That's exactly the feeling!

360
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,190
I don't want to see him wasting his time. I'm afraid he'll regret it later.

361
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,000
Psychology states when a woman deeply loves a man,

362
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,600
she wants to help this man grow and mature, change how he thinks and acts.

363
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,720
Huan-huan, it looks like you

364
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,060
really care about him. He must be able to feel it.

365
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,330
Next, you need to wait until he thinks things through.

366
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,960
If I didn't ask him to stay next to me all day in the past,

367
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,140
he wouldn't have neglected the important matters. It's all because of me.

368
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,980
So now, whether I'm his girlfriend or not, I want him to improve.

369
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,660
Real improvement.

370
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:34,530
Scholar Ye, you're so knowledgable in the psychology of love these days.

371
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,570
Does the Philosophy Department teach this? Confess.

372
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,920
Are you secretly dating and drawing from actual experience? Tell me!

373
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,120
Why are we talking about me?

374
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,370
I'm only in love with books.

375
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,850
Still pretending? Are you saying it or not?

376
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,870
I have a question.

377
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,640
Did you ever chat with a guy online?

378
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,350
How do you guys chat?

379
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,330
What did I say? Something's going on!

380
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,010
What online guy? Hurry and tell me! Confess!

381
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,860
- No, no!
- Don't keep it from me.

382
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,680
- Who is Mr. Bian?
- Over there.

383
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,020
Hello, Mr. Bian, Mr. Zhen is ready to see you.

384
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,480
Investing in Black Scorpions is our biggest move this year for our enterprise.

385
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,470
From their performance early this season,

386
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,940
we've made the right call for this investment.

387
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,480
Both their performance and the enterprise's public image have improved a lot.

388
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,450
I found that since the start of the season, many analysts and fans

389
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,060
have believed that Black Scorpions could win the final.

390
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,950
What do you think of this, Mr. Zhen?

391
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,120
Who do you think are your major opponents

392
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,800
on your winning path? For example, LUU XDragons?

393
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,950
I'm happy about the high expectations for us.

394
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,160
But from changing members to restructuring,

395
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:17,310
Black Scorpion is still a newbie. It's more important to take care of our obligations.

396
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:23,480
Other teams might be powerful. But Black Scorpions can't be ignored.

397
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,850
What do you think of Li Yubing, the star of LUU XDragons?

398
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,140
He did exceptionally well last season.

399
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,330
Under his leadership, they completely defeated Red Beard,

400
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,300
which is a renowned strong team.

401
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,060
He's good.

402
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,660
Later, Li Yubing came to fame in U20.

403
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,320
Commentators said that

404
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,970
he'll be the best ice hockey player domestically.

405
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,420
Facing such a powerful opponent,

406
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,740
does Black Scorpions have any special plans targeting him

407
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,180
when competing with XDragons in the upcoming game?

408
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Sorry, you are asking about our tactics.

409
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,200
I can't tell you that.

410
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,990
Sorry.

411
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,090
Thank you.

412
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,610
Thank you for personally providing so much information.

413
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,270
You are very professional and insightful.

414
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,690
My pleasure. I've read a lot of your pieces

415
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,270
on the ice hockey industry. Very impressive.

416
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,380
Well received. You have great potential.

417
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,360
I'm a good judge of character. You'll have a bright future.

418
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,670
Mr. Zhen, I'm flattered. I'm also very inspired by this interview.

419
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,990
I want to follow and report the development

420
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,430
of ice hockey in Lincheng.

421
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,980
I hope to interview you again, Mr. Zhen.

422
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,890
As long as you need me, you can come at any time.

423
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,260
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

424
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,370
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

425
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,350
All functions are normal.

426
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,630
Except for some superficial wounds due to collisions, there's nothing else to worry about.

427
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,860
Caught a cold?

428
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,980
- Maybe someone is missing me.
- Superstitious.

429
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,390
Not yet proven by science is not necessarily superstition.

430
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,430
It might not be detected yet, like certain diseases.

431
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,740
Mind diseases especially.

432
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,140
Yu Yan, you are here.

433
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,630
Your physical exam results. Have a look.

434
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,030
Thanks.

435
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:56,050
The report shows you are tired. And...

436
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,120
You should be more careful. Are you too stressed?

437
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:11,000
Both winning and losing are ordinary for a soldier. We didn't win last season.

438
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,170
There are some things, only after losing, will you find the right direction.

439
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,220
It was just a match, don't think too much about it.

440
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,130
I'm leaving, Doctor Lin.

441
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,500
Rest well.

442
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,450
Direction? What else deserves me to work towards besides figure skating?

443
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,210
Yu Yan? Yu Yan?

444
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,960
Actually, all your indicators are normal.

445
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm recently hearing ringing in my ears.

446
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,330
Ringing in your ears? But the report shows that your indicators are normal.

447
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,090
Are you too stressed recently? How is your sleep?

448
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,360
If you don't feel well, you'd better rest.

449
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,580
Get back to training and focus on the competition after you've adjusted your mindset.

450
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,780
If I tell the truth, I won't be able to participate in the competition.

451
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,940
Okay. I'll go to bed early these days and I should be fine.

452
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,120
This competition is important to me. I'll adjust myself.

453
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,660
Yu Yan?

454
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,900
Let's add one more exam?

455
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,530
These strawberries are so yummy!

456
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,280
Granny is the best! She sent us so much.

457
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,310
Not just one person but our entire dorm won't even finish them.

458
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,180
I've divided them. These are for Li Yubing and Yu Yan.

459
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,940
This is for Liao Zhenyu. You give to him later.

460
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,510
- I'm leaving.
- Have some more.

461
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,780
- Hello.
 - Come downstairs. Get some strawberries.

462
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,090
From my hometown; super yummy.

463
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,830
Thanks.

464
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,520
I've been too busy lately and haven't visited you. Are you well?

465
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,350
I'm okay. I'm tired after training so I always want to go to bed early.

466
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,830
What about you? How are things between you and Li Yubing?

467
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,940
It's good. Although some things...

468
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,580
Never mind. All can be taken care of.

469
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,940
Okay.

470
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,460
We'll go to the aquarium together next time when we're all free.

471
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,790
I'm leaving.

472
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,810
- Huan-huan, I have something to say.
- I have something to say.

473
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,650
Me first this time, okay? Wait a moment.

474
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,200
Life is long.

475
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,670
Even lovers have different opinions and choices.

476
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:44,280
Someone told me, in a good relationship, every divergence only improves it.

477
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,600
In a bad relationship, it'll make it turn bland.

478
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,900
You know I like cilantro, Sichuan cuisine, and Northeast cuisine.

479
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,200
I have strong tastes.

480
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,720
What are you talking about?

481
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,930
So I've decided to take actions

482
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,290
and work hard to become a qualified doctor

483
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,800
and your, Xia Menghuan's, perfect match.

484
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,460
If you are potatoes, I'm beef brisket.

485
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,410
If you are pickled peppers, I'm fish head.

486
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,390
If you are mushroom, I'm young chicken.

487
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,100
Why am I always the vegetable? Are you all talk?

488
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,170
I'm not kidding this time, for real!

489
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,480
Look, I've made detailed plans.

490
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,330
Look.

491
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,610
I've planned every month, week, day, hour,

492
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,000
quarter, minute, and second, carefully.

493
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,880
You are serious.

494
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,050
Of course.

495
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:46,380
But... I still hope to see you every minute and every second.

496
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,960
- You are at it again.
- Come, sit, sit.

497
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,550
Huan-huan...

498
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,200
I promise you. I definitely will not be like the past.

499
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,080
I won't waste my time on trivial things.

500
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,400
I'll remember your words.

501
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,000
I'll learn from Master Tang and Li Yubing's relationship model.

502
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,830
To improve ourselves in our relationship.

503
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,770
You got it. Really?

504
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,370
I'll have to see your actions.

505
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:22,170
Huan-huan, I promise you that I'll make it this time.

506
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,430
Pinky swear.

507
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,430
Pinky swear.

508
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,950
- Tang Xue is good.
- Seriously.

509
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,190
- I lost. Here.
- I don't have to buy soy milk any more.

510
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,830
We are leaving.

511
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,030
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

512
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,860
- We'll leave too. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

513
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,490
Wei-wei, you are still here.

514
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,140
New muscle tapes, you've lucked out.

515
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,990
Did you misread the quantity again? Thinking its a set when it's a dozen?

516
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,130
No. Aren't you going to compete soon? Better safe than sorry.

517
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,080
Tang Xue. Yours.

518
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,360
This is inappropriate, Jiang Shijia.

519
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,880
Not enough?

520
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,460
One more. This is enough, right?

521
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,300
You are too much.

522
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,490
Why?

523
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,190
Wei-wei is my... bro. She's different.

524
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,260
- I'm leaving.
- Bye-bye.

525
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,980
He's pretty good.

526
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,020
Maybe this is an athlete's romance?

527
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,790
What's wrong with you? Is training not intense enough?

528
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,520
Then, what do you think is an athlete's romance?

529
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,380
Getting a gold medal.

530
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,540
I guess that's true.

531
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,130
But you have to hold the gold medal...

532
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,420
Seriously tell him, this...

533
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,210
this is the world I won for you.
(T/N: speaking as if she's the Emperor)

534
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,000
Time for your medicine.

535
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,360
Seriously,

536
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,520
I think... the most romantic thing is

537
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,570
when you like the person who also likes you.

538
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,420
I'm leaving.

539
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,150
Thank you for the tapes!

540
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,190
[XDragons]

541
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:36,400
Li Yubing, I have never liked the idea of Xiao Xue and you dating.

542
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,000
It was this in the past, it still is right now.

543
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,970
I don't need to talk about the danger in competition, you know it better than me.

544
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,830
Xiao Xue is normally a careless girl.

545
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:56,330
But I know her. She has the softest heart.

546
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:02,170
If you get hurt in a game and it was a serious injury,

547
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,260
then to her, it'll be a heavy blow.

548
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,380
You'll only truly understand my current feelings

549
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,270
when you become a father.

550
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,210
Hey!

551
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,950
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

the four seasons that belong to me ♫

♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal

♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

571
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:04,320
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

572

574
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:24,970
