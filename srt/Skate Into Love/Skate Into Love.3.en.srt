[Episode 3]

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,040
Li Yubing, as a human, you should know when to stop.

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,120
Hey, Tang Xue, I'm really curious

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,860
about what you ate that day. That was a really fragrant smell.

21
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,090
Why do you care? Do you want to learn?

22
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,830
¥1,000 as a fee for the recipe. How about it?

23
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,240
Bring me breakfast tomorrow as usual. Don't be late.

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,470
What happened that day is only known by God, Mother Earth, you, me, and the shower.

25
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,250
If anyone else finds out about it...

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,080
Or else what?

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,340
Nothing will happen.

28
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,790
I was thinking about you since you're the Ice God.

29
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm just a nameless nobody who is studying veterinary science.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,820
If you want, I can write a book titling, "Ice God and I Are Showering Together" right now.

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,630
I can sell it right here with a hawking stall.

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,450
It's very glorious. Fellow students!

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,410
That day, Ice God and I were–

34
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,700
- You're quite feisty.
- You just found out?

35
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,670
- Which one is yours?
- The first one.

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,920
What? Do you want me to send you back?

37
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,150
Pick them up: otherwise, you'll be on the trending topics tomorrow!

38
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,190
Master Tang, good news. I can redeem myself now.

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,880
I found Li Yubing's fan group and successfully infiltrated it. I'll add you to the group.

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,270
I'm not his fan. Why would I join his fan group?

41
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,030
Then you don't understand.

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,030
Only by knowing the enemy and ourselves can we defeat him completely.

43
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,630
You definitely have to join this group!

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Master Tang, isn't this you?

45
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,900
Who took it?

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,370
Who is this? She's studying alone with Ice God? I'm seeing this correctly, right?

47
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,260
Relax, maybe she's a passer-by and sat next to him by chance.

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,450
Don't worry, she looks so tanned. Ice God definitely won't have any interest.

49
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,360
Ice God even rejected the foreign language department's queen, how could he like this girl?

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,380
Don't you have a brain and think about it?

51
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,930
Those clueless netizens just speak and don't take responsibility for what they say.

52
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,520
- I'll use yours to send a message out.
- Go ahead.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,790
I know, I know. This person is my roommate.

54
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,570
She's Li Yubing's childhood sweetheart. He's never forgotten her all these years.

55
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,470
Right now, he's pursuing her to the point of embarrassment.

56
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,380
You probably won't believe it. Even I didn't believe it when I said that.

57
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,890
I just asked my roommate. She said she doesn't like Li Yubing.

58
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,870
But she can't get rid of him and is distressed. Help her think of something!

59
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,500
It's fake.

60
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,470
It's the truth. Oh right!

61
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,660
Li Yubing is also forcing her to deliver breakfast to him.

62
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,060
Do any of you want to replace her and deliver breakfast to him?

63
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,410
She really doesn't care to do it.

64
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,240
Me, me, me. I'll do it!

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,020
Thumbs up.

66
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,860
There are so many people who want to deliver breakfast for Li Yubing.

67
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,400
My roommate decided to host an auction. The highest bid wins.

68
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,290
She'll donate the money to the Universal Association to Rescue Victims.

69
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,610
No charge if you don't reach your goal.

70
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,520
Wait. The Universal Association to Rescue Victims?

71
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,640
What kind of organization?

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,060
This one... I just created it.

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,700
The victim to be rescued is me, Tang Xue.

74
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,640
What?

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,790
Since I'm being severely persecuted by Li Yubing.

76
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm in deep distress.

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,290
So setting up a rescue association is my last effort of struggle.

78
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,940
Doesn't it require a bit of encouragement and praise?

79
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,070
Of course, Master Tang. You've done so well.

80
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,690
Ever since I've known you, my entire worldview

81
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,950
has been constantly being made new.

82
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,030
Finally, I don't have to wake up early tomorrow.

83
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,300
800 palace guards run to the north slope, the artillery run on their northern side,
(T/N: a well-known Chinese tongue twister)

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,310
the artillery are afraid to run into the guards, the guards are afraid to run into the cannons.

85
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,470
800 palace guards run to the north slope,

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,760
the artillery run on their northern side,

87
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,620
the artillery are afraid to run into the guards—

88
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,740
Why are you running so slow?

89
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,820
So tired.

90
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,890
Lately,

91
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,130
why are you always with Tang Xue?

92
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,840
Tang Xue?

93
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,180
Helping her to become an adult.

94
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,590
Become an adult?

95
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,580
Is there something going on between you two?

96
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,460
What are you doing? It's almost time for breakfast delivery.

97
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,880
It will be there very soon.

98
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,770
Okay.

99
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,430
Hello, Ice God.

100
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,990
I'm Qiu Qiu. You can call me Qiu-qiu.
(T/N: playing the Chinese tones, her name can sound like ball-ball)

101
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,700
This is your breakfast.

102
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,280
My breakfast? Where's Tang Xue?

103
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,890
Tang Xue? She has to take care of an emergency.

104
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,470
She was afraid you'll be impatient so she asked me to deliver breakfast for you.

105
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,460
You...

106
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,180
Tell me the truth. I'll treat you to a movie.

107
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,220
Thank you.

108
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,130
Ice God, are you really pursuing Tang Xue incessantly

109
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,330
and can't get her off your mind?

110
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,130
Are you okay?

111
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,080
Thanks for breakfast.

112
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
Big Jiang, bring my backpack.

113
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,120
Wow, Master Tang! Someone wants to buy a month of breakfast delivery.

114
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,060
- It's in my plan.
- You're not curious who it is?

115
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,680
No matter who it is. She is my benefactor.

116
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,970
It is a girl named Zhou Ran.

117
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,960
Which Zhou Ran?

[Zhou Ran]

119
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,310
- No.
- What? Do you know her?

120
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,230
Cousin.

121
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,270
I heard Aunt say you also made it to LUU. I couldn't believe it at first.

122
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,940
You thought I couldn't get in?

123
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,700
Later on, I heard you were majoring in Veterinary Science.

124
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,250
So I believed it. It suits you.

125
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,910
It can't be compared to you guys in broadcasting.

126
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,960
Since we are family, seek my help when you're sick. Free of charge.

127
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,420
I heard you booked a month of delivering Li Yubing's breakfast. Are you interested in him?

128
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,100
We're both outstanding. With this opportunity, we'll get to know each other.

129
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,490
Not that I'm interested. But when we're more familiar in the future, should he show interest in me,

130
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,560
I will think about it.

131
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,290
Sorry, it's no longer for sale.

132
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,640
What? You're interested and afraid I'll steal him?

133
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,770
You're thinking too much. Li Yubing is not that good.

134
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,760
Speaking as a family member, I'm afraid you'll suffer.

135
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Suffering is happiness, I'm willing to suffer.

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,030
Also, he's Ice God. We don't know who's going to suffer.

137
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,710
Well, anyway, it is your fate.

138
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,330
Don't come to me after suffering. I don't offer after-sale customer service.

139
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,800
Don't worry, but I heard that...

140
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,340
you are his assistant?

141
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,190
When we are close, I'll put in a good word for you.

142
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,530
Oh right! This is a special delivery from Grandma.

143
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,310
Since we were young, Grandma always told me to let you have your way. And now, she even asked me to deliver these for you.

144
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,770
- Hey, classmate, can you help me?
- Sure.

145
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,690
- This is too heavy. Can you help me bring it back to the dorm?
- Okay.

146
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,630
Thank you.

147
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,010
This one is for my cousin, can you also send it to her dorm?

148
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,460
Okay.

149
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,530
I'll do it myself. Let's go.

150
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
- Thanks.
- She's your relative?

151
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,500
You two don't get along?

152
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,950
- Oh my!
- My goodness!

153
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,690
Our Bing-bing can't stop thinking about her.

154
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,770
Unable to stop himself from pestering her.

155
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,050
Like I said.

00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,140
Ridiculous.

157
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,720
Look! Li Yubing's fan club is still discussing your scandalous photos.

158
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,880
Our Ice God never gets close to girls.

159
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,440
Much less his assistant.

160
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,090
Fatty, what are you implying?

161
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,580
Think about it! Overbearing CEO

162
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,060
and his personal secretary.

163
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,150
That's right Bing-bing, not even telling us the truth.

164
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,410
Tell us. What's your relationship with her?

165
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,950
Master Tang.

166
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,220
The more I look at this picture, the more intimate you guys look.

167
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,490
When did you go blind?

168
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,240
Nietzsche said, "There is always some madness in love."
(T/N: Friedrich Nietzsche is a German philosopher)

169
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,020
"But there is also always some reason in madness."

170
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,670
Master Tang, do you guys really have no chance?

171
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,490
Impossible! If I like her,

172
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,610
then I'll eat instant noodles without seasoning in the future.

173
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:14,260
Impossible! If I like him, I'll eat instant noodles with just seasoning in the future.

174
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,870
Ice God!

175
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,890
- Oh, it's you.
- It's me.

176
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,380
Thanks for your tissue last time. I'm Li Yubing. What's your name?

177
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,210
M name is Zhou Ran, Tang Xue's older cousin. I'm in the broadcasting department at our school.

178
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,410
I never knew Tang Xue had a cousin at this school.

179
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,940
We just reconnected recently.

180
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,420
I've heard Xiao Xue say that she is your assistant.
(T/N: xiao means little in Chinese, a type of endearment to add before one's name)

181
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,690
My younger cousin is careless and stubborn. I hope that Senior understands.

182
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,120
Oh right! This is your breakfast.

183
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,950
Oh, thanks.

184
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,570
I grew up with Xiao Xue.

185
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,080
Xiao Xue is good at everything except for the fact that she likes sleeping in.

186
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,200
She believes that "bugs who wake up early in the morning get eaten."

187
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,800
Not like us hardworking birds.

188
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,780
You have to wake up early to practice hockey, while I have to practice my voice.

189
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,060
So I might as well take over the mission of bringing you breakfast.

190
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,550
I believed that Senior wouldn't mind,

191
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,850
because Xiao Xue says that you're a good person.

192
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,230
She said that I am a good person?

193
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,610
You guys have a great relationship.

194
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,180
That's right.

195
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,480
They say we're allowed to ice skate for free, but the teams practice there every day.

196
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,410
When do we have time to practice?

197
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,770
If you really want to learn, roller skating is fine.

198
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,860
Other than technical details, everything else is the same.

199
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,140
Master Tang, you should come with us!

200
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,250
I can't today. I have to go to the gymnasium today.

201
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,700
A lasting mistake. Why did I choose some On-Ice Club in the beginning?

202
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,680
Luckily, there is just one month. It will be over soon.

203
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,930
Master Tang, since it's on our way, we'll go with you and intimidate that Ice God.

204
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,080
Let's go!

205
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,020
Ice God, Tang Xue was auctioning off the spot of sending you breakfast.

206
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,970
¥50 for one time as the starting bid, more expensive than your breakfast.

207
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,010
In the end, it was sold to a girl called Zhou Ran for the whole month.

208
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,820
Other than the fact that she has intentions, she also has a lot of money.

209
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,710
Have you had any breakfast?

210
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,900
- No.
- Then, how about we eat here together?

211
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,610
All right.

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,200
Tang Xue. Tang Xue! Come here.

213
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,950
Haven't you already got your breakfast! What do you want me for?

214
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,570
Oh right! Thank you, Classmate Zhou Ran.

215
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,310
The breakfast you sent was very... sumptuous.

216
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,480
So long as you like it then I'm happy.

217
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,020
Throw away the trash for me.

218
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,350
You don't have hands yourself?

219
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,510
Could you throw mine away, too?

220
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,310
Ice God, you're going to be busy later, right?

221
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,940
Then I'll get going.

222
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,680
Good luck.

223
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,000
What did she say to you?

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,320
She said that she is your cousin.

225
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,200
What else?

226
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,990
She also said she was smarter, prettier, and more considerate than you.

227
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,380
- You're saying our Master Tang isn't smart, pretty, and considerate of others?
- Exactly.

228
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,120
Classmate, as long as you understand.

229
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,930
Li Yubing.

230
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,980
After throwing out the trash, come in here.

231
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,990
- Li Yubing, stop right there. I–
- I'm warning you!

232
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,530
I'm warning you!

233
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,300
Master Tang is studying Veterinary Medicine.

234
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,470
A veterinarian!

235
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,100
If you dare bully our Master Tang.

236
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,270
If you dare.

237
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,310
I have a hundred ways to cripple you.

238
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,100
I'll give you a–

239
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,020
It's easier to change mountains and rivers than one's character, Tang Xue.
 (T/N: you can't change who you are)

240
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,860
I didn't think after so many years, you still only have the hobby of taking in disciples.
(T/N: think: minions, little followers)

241
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,160
Your level of making friends right now...

242
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,360
is difficult to describe.

243
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,100
Li Yubing, what do you mean? Tell me clearly.

244
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,550
- Come in quickly.
- His bag.

245
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,490
Little sheep... Little sheep!

246
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,430
I didn't know you did figure skating. You're so awesome. What you did earlier was amazing.

247
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,520
What are you doing here?

248
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,170
That piece of music really fits you!

249
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,790
Coach Jin,

250
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,110
I'll choose this piece then.

251
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,300
Choosing this piece?

252
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,370
But this piece doesn't really follow the style of the judging panel this time.

253
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,900
I have a feeling for this piece.

254
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,250
I trust your feeling but I think

255
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,270
there are many other songs that will also let you have feelings.

256
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,750
Why don't you try it? Then, I'll find some and let you have a listen. Okay?

257
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

258
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,670
Let's go.

259
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,520
I was saying it casually so don't take it personally.

260
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,830
I also like it.

261
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,820
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

262
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,790
- We haven't finished practicing yet.
- But we need to practice.

263
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,310
Give us a face. This is Yu Yan's first time joining the figure skating team.

264
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,330
You can't have no place to practice the first time a world champion comes, right?

265
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,880
What champion?

266
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,640
You still cannot delay our practice. Also, you guys have a champion but we also have an Ice God. Right?!

267
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,260
Yeah!

268
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,880
A local Ice God. What's to brag about?

269
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,010
Say it again.

270
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,840
Hello, Ice God.

271
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,380
Hello, figure skating prodigy.

272
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,610
Yu Yan, we're all waiting for your newest move. Go ahead.

273
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,840
Yes, Little Sheep. Look how well you've skated just now.

274
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,720
Show it to them.

275
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,230
But, Classmate Tang Xue, whose assistant are you?

276
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:34,780
Apparently the most sensible person on the hockey team is just an assistant.

277
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,210
What do you mean?

278
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,190
Line up!

279
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,020
What's going on?

280
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,510
Coach Xu, the figure skating team is using our ice time, not letting us go on.

281
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,620
- And this isn't the first time.
- What's wrong with that?

282
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,410
The club gave half the ice time to the hockey team

283
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,970
and the speed skating team. Our figure skating team has very little time.

284
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,290
What's wrong with occasionally increasing our time?

285
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,050
Coach Jin, you are our coach. You have to help us.

286
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,170
This is a problem between us coaches and Manager Ma.

287
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,290
What is there for you to argue over?

288
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,630
Don't be impetuous. I understand the figure skating team feels unjust.

289
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,360
I have reported this issue to Manager Ma.

290
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,520
Today is the first practice for Yu Yan after joining the XDragons Club.

291
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,650
Our ice hockey team will let you have the rink today, okay?

292
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,370
- Is that all right?
- Yes!

293
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,100
Thank you, Coach Xu, for your generosity.

294
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,470
I'll take this opportunity to officially introduce to everyone.

295
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,300
Yu Yan, our club's youngest athlete.

296
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,220
But he's already got 13 years of experience on the ice. He's a national athlete,

297
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,990
3-year consecutive winner of the Figure Skating Championship and National Grand Prix.

298
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,790
Because he's joined the XDragons Club, that's why he's here at LUU's sports college.

299
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,600
From today on, he is also a member of our On-Ice family.

300
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,740
Old Xu, arrange some time one day.

301
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,530
Let Yu Yan help everyone improve their footwork on the ice

302
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,380
and help everyone improve their flow with turns.

303
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,270
Let's take advantage of this coincidence. Since Yu Yan is here today,

304
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,960
let him perform a bit.

305
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,460
Show these ice hockey blockheads his talent.

306
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,570
Okay!

307
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,560
Let's go! Fighting! Let's go! Fighting!

308
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,240
Let's go! Fighting! Let's go! Fighting!

309
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,650
Mohawk, back cross over,

310
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,440
- twizzle.
- Stop!

311
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,590
You actually guessed it right.

312
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,040
What's so great about that?

313
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,300
What's great about it?

314
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,030
If anyone on the hockey team can match his standards,

315
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,950
- I'll skate upside down.
- You're looking down on us?

316
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,030
Do you think we hockey players only rely on our strength?

317
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,120
Let me tell you. Even though each of us is bigger than you little punk by a circle,

318
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,630
we are technical and agile strong men.

319
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,660
You said it yourself, skating upside down. Just you wait.

320
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,820
I'll go!

321
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,420
Finally I didn't come for nothing. There's an ice battle to watch.

322
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,730
Let's go!

323
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,030
Is that a New Year's greeting?

324
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,550
How polite!

325
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,960
I'll do it.

326
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,440
Let's go, Ice God!

327
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,660
Bing-bing, I want to see him skate upside down.

328
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,220
Let's go!

329
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,330
That was great!

330
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,920
Back cross over. Toe-step jump.

331
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,020
It's a cross-foot spin.

332
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,220
An ice hockey player

333
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,150
wearing hockey skates can move this smoothly.

334
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,970
Not bad!

335
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,110
He's Ice God!

336
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,580
Bunnyhop, lunge, mohawk, back outside edge... get ready

337
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,050
Double axel!

338
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,160
Ice God can't do it all.

339
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,530
The Ice God isn't really that great.

340
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,030
What are you talking about!? We are wearing hockey skates,

341
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,700
you guys are wearing figure skates! They have toepicks!

342
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,300
We have different technical focuses. Mistakes are normal. What are you so proud of?

343
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,930
- Yeah, yeah!
- Enough, enough!

344
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,230
If you lost, you lost. There's no need to go on about it.

345
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,080
What are you looking at? There's nothing interesting to see.

346
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,900
I'm ecstatic that you fell.

347
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,080
- Hit me, if you dare.
- You!

348
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,410
It's okay. So long as we all practice, we will be fine.

349
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,970
Everybody, let's take a 10-minute break. When you come back,

350
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,580
we'll watch the training and footwork of the figure skating team.

351
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,430
Wait till we get back and I'll teach you a lesson.

352
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,350
Here.

353
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,830
Thank you.

354
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,990
So your name is Yu Yan? Say, a person

355
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,980
like you, with good looks, a good name, and good skills,

356
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,030
should only exist in comics books.

357
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,980
Kiss-ass.

358
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm Tang Xue, the hockey team's assistant. If you need anything in the future, come find me.

359
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Tang Xue, you've also got a good name.

360
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,740
A couple of ass-kissers.

361
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,080
I said do you have nothing better to do today?

362
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,170
Yeah, I am salty. I'm thirsty, get me a bottle of water.
(T/N: a play on words, tone of 'xian' can be bored or salty)

363
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,780
Don't pay attention to him.

364
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,940
Hey, Tang Xue, unscrew the cap for me.

365
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,740
You don't have your own hands, do you?

366
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,990
No, its because I...

367
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,330
- I bumped it on ice. Quickly.
- Okay

368
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,200
I'll help you.

369
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,800
You're not thirsty any more?

370
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
No, I drank enough.

371
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,100
Yu Yan, let's go eat.

372
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,700
Coach Jin, the kid you brought this time is not bad.

373
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,300
Of course.

374
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,100
A gold medal coach should be coaching gold medal athletes.

375
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,100
It looks like I'll win the Best Coach award this year again.

376
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
Old Jin, this is what I don't understand.

377
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,600
You've gotten Best Coach for so many years, how are you still so ambitious?

378
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,100
Athletes should go for the gold medal, coaches should go for the Best Coach award. What's wrong with that?

379
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,000
Or should I be like you, just carrying around crackers pointlessly every day with no ambition?

380
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,400
Yes, yes! Whatever you say is right.

381
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,300
But speaking of such a prodigy,

382
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,400
what lies did you have to tell to get him into XDragons?

383
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,600
I have many tactics.

384
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,300
What do you mean lies?

385
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,800
He came here because of the good reputation, okay? Did I lie?

386
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
- Don't be so agitated.
- Am I agitated?

387
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,100
You're still not agitated? I'll find a mirror so you can see it.

388
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,400
He's a great learner, so teach him well.

389
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
Big Xu,

390
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
you're a pretty interesting person.

391
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,000
When we were young, you fought with me over a girl.

392
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Now that we're older and coaches, you're fighting with me over the ice rink.

393
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,100
Tell me. What are you so unhappy with me about to keep fighting with me?

394
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,800
- Who's fighting with you over the ice rink?
- You are.

395
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
That's because the time wasn't coordinated well. And what do you mean fighting over a girl?

396
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,900
Do I need to fight for a girl? She came to me because of my reputation.

397
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,200
Whatever. Because of your reputation?

398
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,900
You're already divorced. You're in the cemetery of a failed marriage.

399
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,700
Just write your epitaph already!

400
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,200
- How can you talk like this?
- This is just how I talk.

401
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,100
Looks like I'm successful in both love and career.

402
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,000
What does that mean?

403
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,800
It's a bad meaning for you. I've been chosen by fate.

404
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,700
With your attitude, you definitely have to get chosen.

405
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
Keep it up! Keep it up!

406
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,800
This is Yu Yan.

407
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,600
So, you're the figure skating prodigy?

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,700
This is Xia Menghuan, my roommate.

409
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,900
Hello, nice to meet you.

410
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,200
Then since Master Tang calls you Little Sheep, I'll do that, too.

411
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh, okay.

412
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,800
He's so obedient.

413
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,900
Way better than that Li Yubing.

414
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:55,100
Are you joking? He's well-mannered and he's talented, too.

415
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,200
You didn't see him at the rink just now.

416
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,800
His skating is as smooth as silk.

417
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,800
His moves... I can't describe it.

418
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,200
I want to go see him later, too.

419
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,000
I never knew Little Sheep's life was so difficult.

420
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,300
Maybe he's poor? That must be why he's so skinny.

421
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,600
Yu Yan, I've been on a diet recently, I can't eat this much.

422
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,500
Don't be wasteful, eat it.

423
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm also on a diet. I can't eat these high-calorie foods.

424
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I didn't open this yet, you drink it.

425
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,000
This has too many calories, too. I'll just drink water. You guys drink it.

426
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,600
He's clearly too embarrassed to tell the truth.

427
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Let me tell you. When it comes to dieting,

428
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,400
I have the most experience. You have to eat well to have the energy to diet.

429
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,800
Isn't that right? Here, eat some more.

430
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,000
I really can't eat it. I-I'm allergic.

431
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,300
He really cares too much about what other people think.

432
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,400
Okay then, never mind.

433
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,900
Li Yubing, give me the Kinder Joy.

434
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,100
And stickers, too. I want all of it!

435
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,800
And chocolate, give me everything!

436
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,100
Tang Xue, you're so old and still taking food from others. When will you learn to respect others?

437
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,600
When did you see me disrespecting other people?

438
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,700
Huh?

439
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,800
When did you see me disrespecting other people?

440
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,400
You're eating the food you took from other people and still trying to defend yourself.

441
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,100
You say I'm taking food from other people? Fine, then I'll take it for you to see.

442
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,000
You say I'm taking food from other people? Fine, then I'll take it for you to see.

443
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,900
Are you here acting all hopeless and dejected? Here, I'll give it to you.

444
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,200
You're really becoming more and more brazen.

445
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,300
Let me tell you. You don't need to steal from others, okay?

446
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,100
Don't look.

447
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Here's some advice. Stay away from Tang Xue, or else she'll bully you to death.

448
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,100
I don't think so, I think she's quite nice.

449
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,800
Did you hear that?

450
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
Did you hear that?

451
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
You've been brainwashed so quickly, haven't you?

452
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Good for you, Tang Xue. Your skills haven't diminished from before.

453
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,300
[Female Dormitory]

454
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,000
I want to watch the rain in a thatched pavilion.

455
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,800
Watch ants beside a rock garden.

456
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,000
Watch butterflies fall in love and spiders spin their webs.

457
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Watch water, clouds, and waterfalls.

458
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,600
Watch Song Qingru sound asleep.
(T/N: a well-known Chinese translator for Shakespearean works and wife of a poet)

459
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,300
So pretentious.

460
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,700
Who hasn't fallen in love? Why watch butterflies?

461
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,500
Got nothing better to do.

462
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,600
Pretentious poem.

463
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,700
Moderator, remove this post.

464
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,740
This world is too superficial.

465
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,700

Li Yubing must be crazy. What does my eating have to do with him?
