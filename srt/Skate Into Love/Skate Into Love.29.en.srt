What's wrong?

20
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,860
Nothing.

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,420
I've known you since we were 6 years old. Do you think I can't tell?

22
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,160
Tang Xue.

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,340
Are you scared?

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,060
Scared of what?

25
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,630
Scared that I'll get hurt during a game.

26
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,370
How should I say this? Before, I just thought hockey was pretty exciting.

27

It's fun and interesting.

I want you to win and I'm scared for you to lose.

30
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,730
Of course, I'm also scared for you to get hurt. But...

31
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,970
This is the golden shield that is passed down from the Tang ancestors.

32
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,950
With this shield, nothing that flies in the sky, swims in the sea, or runs on the earth can harm you.

33
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,620
As long as you are working hard towards your shining dream, I'm not scared.

34
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,440
I'm more scared of you being a coward and not moving forward.

35
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,470
What is there to be scared of when the two of us are together, right?

36
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,160
Dreams don't shine by themselves.

Say, Bing-bing seems different recently. He used so much force.

Okay.

52

Have you discussed it with Tang Xue yet?

53
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,850
Just a little.

Recently, I've practiced all kinds of

58
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,280
ways to skate through the curves.

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,490
But why are my scores

60
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,270
only getting worse and not getting better?

61
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,650
That's okay.

62
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,940
My book here talks about this. Let me look for it for you.

63
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,110
They say that the period after a change is the "weak change period."

64
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,180
It says that after you change your methods, your results will get worse for a while.

65
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,810
During this time, you need to endure. A lot of people give up in this period.

Lower your upper body, and keep your inside leg going in the direction of the track.

Hurry, it's starting now.

320

The competition is about to begin.

321
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:28,060
I believe this competition will be very intense. Just by looking at their previous results, they're all evenly matched.

322
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,980
Go to the start.

323
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,860
Ready.

324
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,220
Coach,

325
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,280
are you really confident in me?

326
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,410
What? You are not confident?

327
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,540
I am. Tomorrow will be my home field.

328
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,610
Let me witness your performance.

329
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,770
Why are you third? Come on! Pass her from the inside!

330
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,790
Pass her! Pass.

331
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,870
What is she doing? She has to at least get silver!

332
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,790
Steady!

333
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,130
Pass her!

334
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,060
Tang Xue is awesome!

335
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,590
She made a successful pass. Once again in second place.

336
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,380
Great!

337
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,100
- Not bad. Pretty good.
- That was great.

338
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,920
Put on your jacket.

339

Let's take a look.

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,310
Who passed the finish line first?

341
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,270
Who is it?

342
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,150
Congratulations to Tang Xue!

343
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,600
Tang Xue from Lincheng Union University won by barely a quarter of a skate against

344
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,590
Qincheng Technology University's Miao Di. She's the winner. Congrats to Tang Xue!

345
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,510
Congrats to Tang Xue, the winner of this competition.

346
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,830
We hope to see her on the national team.

353
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,110
why aren't you training?

354
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,200
Mom, you were right.

355
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,010
I'm not good enough. I need to work harder.

You're growing up.

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,270
Listen to your mom. Pressure is motivation.

358
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,200
I left for just a few days, and look at the place now.

359
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,870
It's so dirty. I'll clean up.

We did very well this time.

362
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,430
Tang Xue won the 500-meter gold medal.

365

Tang Xue, can I see your gold medal?

366
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,260
- I want to see.
- Wow, it's a gold medal.

367
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,600
Next time, I'll get a gold medal, too.

You? Forget about it.

Don't feel like you took my gold medal.

373

You did really well today. You deserve this gold medal.

Thank you, Captain!

Tang Xue, you won the gold medal. Who do you want to thank the most?

377
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,390
Of course, it's Mommy Chu. Right?

378
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,570
That's enough from you. I know there's someone else who comes before me.

379
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,980
- Who?
- Who?

380

It's getting late, everyone head back and get some rest.

Captain, be careful.

383
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,270
Mom, did you guys watch the competition?

384
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,800
We did, we did. It's your competition, we must watch it!

I'm so happy I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

Where's my dad?

387
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,180
Your dad? Your dad watched it, too. He's pretending to be aloof, I'll show you.

388
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,360
Do you see him?

389
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,980
Do you see?

390
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,750
Have him come and talk for a bit.

391
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,780
Come here, come here. What are you doing? Your daughter wants to talk to you.

392
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,200
Daughter, Dad saw your competition. You skated really well today.

393
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,060
Then... do you support me returning to short track speed skating?

394
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,760
Daughter,

395
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:04,070
actually, in the past, Dad really just wanted you to

396
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,850
have a peaceful life.

397
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,600
But I was wrong.

398
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,930
I know now.

399
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:17,970
If short track speed skating is an ocean,

400
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,520
then my daughter is a big ship.

401
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:29,960
If we don't let the ship leave the harbor just to keep it safe,

402
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,520
the ship loses its meaning.

404
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,480
is for you to be happy your entire life,

405
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,760
and to live with a purpose.

I'm just missing a professional team that wants me.

456
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,310
I used to think that way, too.

457
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,860
I wanted to skate for the rest of my life.

458
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,660
But now, I'm not sure anymore.

459
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,780
Tell me the truth. Are you badly hurt?

460
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm not. It's just an old injury. It'll get better with time.

But...

462

it was the best chance to enter the national team roster.

464

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,250
It's not like you. Didn't you hurt your leg?
