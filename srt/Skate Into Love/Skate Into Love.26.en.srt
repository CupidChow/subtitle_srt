[Episode 26]

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,330
Say, my dear Captain, are you sure you are going to do this?

19
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm sure.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,220
Well, I can't imagine the humiliation afterward.

21
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,150
Go for it!

22
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,520
Tonight, it is the home game

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
of LUU's XDragons Team against the Harbin Bears.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,760
As we all know, the Bears have many excellent players such as Song Anjie.

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,770
Tonight, they are fighting against the favored XDragons Team.

26
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,610
It is bound to be a really exciting game.

27
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,960
Will the guest team, Harbin Bears win the competition?

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,140
It is something we have to find out later.

29
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,570
Another highlight of the game

30
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,780
is about the two star players,

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,480
Song Anjie and Li Yubing.

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,740
The fight between the two.

33
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,750
Players of the two teams have all entered into the arena.

34
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,440
Well, we see Li Yubing and Song Anjie lead their teammates to enter the field.

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
The two are the most important player in each team.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,050
They worked very well together in the China Youth Team.

37
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,290
How good will they be this time?

38
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,110
Let's wait and see.

39
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,090
Let's take a look at the hockey stick of Li Yubing.

40
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,050
It's pink.

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,100
Has the Ice God become possessed by Sailor Moon?

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,900
A pink hockey stick.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,590
I can't look at him anymore!

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,360
Hey, Master Tang, you did it. Right?

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,300
I didn't know he would use it for the game.

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,280
It is the opening game.

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,960
You rule, Ice God.
(T/N: internet slang: shuangji = thumbs up; 666 in Chinese sounds like lol)

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,450
A small gift but it means a lot.

49
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,950
The ancient saying is so true.

50
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,370
I just want to tell everyone that you, Tang Xue, are the one I love.

51
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,410
I won't hide it. I will say that proudly.

52
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,250
You promised you would keep a low profile!

53

Tang Xue, so you really are here.

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
I have two messages for you.

123

One is good the other is bad. Which one do you want to hear first?

124

The good one.

125
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,000
The good one is that Yu Yan is back.

126
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,600
The bad one is he did not do well in his competition.

127
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,900
It can't be true. He told me he was preparing really well for it.

128
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Senior, it's all because of you so that we can win the game.

This is Zhou Ran of the Broadcasting Department. She said she wants to do an exclusive interview.

- We can do the exclusive interview…

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,900
But you have to send me the outline and questions first.

142
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,000
You have to set up the time with me in advance.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,700
And the outline. I have to read it first.

144
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't get in my way. It's senior I want to interview.

146

Senior Brother,

147
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,200
why don't you stay inside with your Junior Zhou?

148
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I thought you didn't know how to be jealous.

149
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Who's jealous?

150
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,500
I only eat candy.
(T/N: jealous in chinese literally means eat vinegar)

151
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,800
We've been together for quite a long time. Don't you know the type I like?

152
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,700
How do I know? I can't read your mind.

153
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
Actually, my type is...

154
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,200
hot-tempered, not very girly, and

155
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,900
- not good-looking, but worth a second look.
- Li Yubing!

156
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,500
Listen. You are jealous but I'm happily eating candy.

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,200
Sorry. Kids are so rude these days. We are going.

159
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I still want chicken wings.

160
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's go. It's crazy inside!

161
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
We're going inside already?

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Come on.

163
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The champion!

164
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Wei-wei!

165
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,400
You should stay with your bros. Why are you here?

166
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,500
Wei-wei, why are you sitting here alone? Drink some of this cocktail.

167
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,400
You are an athlete. Try and not to drink this kind of thing.

168
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,600
We are celebrating our triumph. We are happy.

169
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
I will drink this then.

170
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
I know you want to drink it.

171
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Drink some. If you get drunk today, I will carry you back.

172
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,700
You?

173
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,300
Look at this glass. Shiny as crystal.

174
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
See?

175
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Bro, is your nickname "Show-off"?

176
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,900
Fill my glass!

177
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,470
Why do you always carry a book with you every day?

178
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,300
You wouldn't understand.

179
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,200
Do you know that people should know themselves?

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,900
People like us, who are about to leave college and go into the real world,

181
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,400
will only grow by knowing ourselves.

182
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,400
You won't understand it. Otherwise, your skin wouldn't be so thick.

183
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,700
You can take it. Read it and learn to know yourself.

184
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,000
Study hard and improve yourself.

185
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Study hard. Improve yourself.

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
- Study hard…
- Pour drinks.

187
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Cheers!

188
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,500
You said Li Yubing wouldn't have a relationship, but he did.

189
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,800
You said he wouldn't tell it to the public, but he did it too.

190
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,400
What kind of a job are you doing as the club manager?

191
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,300
You didn't have to make this trip just to tell me this.

192
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,700
A phone call will do.

193
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,400
How about we go to my office and talk?

194
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,600
It's a long story. He is in a relationship with her.

195
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,500
And he's a bit too high key.

196
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,200
I don't have time to talk. I only care for results.

197
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,900
Let's make it simple. How will you handle this?

198
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,700
They're already together. What can I do?

199
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,900
But I guarantee that nothing will go wrong with me here.

200
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Something is wrong already and you dare say that? You only know how to boast.

201
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not.

202
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
Didn't you see? They won and Li Yubing was the best player.

203
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
He has maintained a healthy and positive image. Nothing is against the contract.

204
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,500
And he's more popular now because of the incident.

205
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,900
Li Yubing has just started the journey to be a professional player. He is still building his foundation.

206
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,200
You go and tell him. Say it's my words.

207
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,000
He should focus on training. He's still young. He can date in a few years.

208
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,300
I can't say it. How can I ask people to break up?

209
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,200
Li Yubing and Tang Xue have promised me that

210
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,000
the relationship won't influence their training. And they really mean it.

211
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
I believe in them.

212
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Ma Xiaoshan, where do you stand?

213
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,800
You are the manager of the club. You should be on the side of the club.

214
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,700
You normally call him "little ancestor." Are you really treating him as if he's your ancestor?

215
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,600
He is just a player in the club.

216
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,700
No, it's not. Dad…

217
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,900
Chairman.

218
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,000
We are running a club, but we have to be reasonable.

219
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,200
We can't be a tyrant or a fascist when it comes to management.

220
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,000
If there's something wrong with Li Yubing, you must take full responsibility.

221
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,300
How dare you call me a fascist?

222
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Sorry. My apologies.

223
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,800
You are not a fascist. If you are, I'm the son of a fascist.

224
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,300
Were you pretending to be the Chairman's son again? That won't do.
(T/N: were you sucking up to the chairman)

225
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,100
You have to pretend to be his grandson.

226
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,000
You came at just the right time. I have something to tell you.

227
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,700
What do you mean pretend? He is my father!

228
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,200
Manager Ma, what do you need from me?

229
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
Yu Yan had such an ugly loss.

230
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Yu Yan is still very young. He will adjust back to normal very soon.

231
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,700
And I'm his coach. I believe he will win next time.

232
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,000
Since our best Coach Jin has this kind of confidence,

233
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm reassured.

234
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,900
I'm waiting to give you that award soon.

235
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,700
Not you.

236
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,000
The chairman you just called "father" is the only one qualified to present the award.

237
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
We are a family. It makes no difference.

238
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
All right. As long as Yu Yan has a good performance,

239
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,600
I can have not only the "father" but also the "grandfather" for you.

240
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,750
Like you really can.

241
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,700
What an amazing game yesterday! Ice God lives up to his name.

242
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,200
He is certainly the best looking guy in LUU!

243
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,100
Tang Xue is so blessed to be Li Yubing's girlfriend.

244
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,300
Don't explain it with superstition. Tang Xue is just lucky to be with Ice God.

245
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,800
It was also because of Ice God that Tang Xue won the most popular award in the campus singing competition.

246
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Figure Skating Prodigy Yu Yan also helped in the campus singing competition, it wasn't all just Li Yubing.

247
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,100
Yu Yan is so pitiful these days…

248
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
That's it for today.

249
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay, let's get off the ice.

250
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,080
Take a rest, Yu Yan.

251
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,810
You don't need to be so hard on yourself.

252
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,660
At this moment, you are still the best here.

253
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,020
Also, Sister Liang said you're not answering her calls.

254
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,580
She wants me to tell you that she won't have time to visit you anytime soon.

255
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,390
When you win the world championship, what reason will I have to stop you from dating?

256
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,970
At this moment, I have nothing except figure skating.

257
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,520
Did you all see the pathetic face of Yu Yan?

258
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,300
It's just one loss and he is practicing like crazy. No wonder he has no friends.

259
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,330
He is a figure skating prodigy. Of course, he has be hard on himself.

260
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,420
If it were you, you wouldn't even care if you had ten continuous trips.

261
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,200
Little Sheep.

262
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,210
I completely lost. You must be very disappointed.

263
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,280
Every world champion has failed before.

264
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,510
It's good you didn't get hurt. That is already a very lucky thing.

265
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,380
This is my old wound. Does it look scary?

266
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,300
How come you never told me about what happened to you in the past?

267
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,920
It's no big deal.

268
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,820
I was very silly at that time.

269
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,230
I had no idea that a wound would heal some day.

270
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,890
So I just got stuck in confusion and depression.

271
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,750
I even quit the short track speeding skating in the end.

272
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,220
But I turned out to be fine, right?

273
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,710
It's good that I'm back.

274
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,290
The most horrible thing is not failure itself,

275
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:56,480
but the fact that you've lost the courage to get back up again.

276
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,020
It's a pretty necklace.

277
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,580
Dog gave it to me.

278
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,060
Tang Xue,

279
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,350
are you really with Li Yubing?

280
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,010
Yes.

281
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,440
Bing-bing, let's grab something to eat together later.

282
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,540
I will pass. I'm meeting Tang Xue later.

283
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,600
Look at you.

284
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,840
You totally dump your boys once you have your girl.

285
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,610
- Who dumped you?
- Big Jiang.

286
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,000
Why are you jealous of her?

287
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,140
Tell me. Can you shout out that intoxicating "Champion!

288
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,350
You are my champion"?

289
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,480
Thank you!

290
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,900
Stop it, you guys. Go and eat.

291
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,990
We are so jealous that we can't eat anything.

292
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,030
Crystal Sugar stewed with Snow Pear?

293
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,600
- You scared me.
- So sweet that my teeth are falling out.

294
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,020
You are peeping at my phone, are you?

295
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,740
Good for you. I wouldn't have found out this secret if I hadn't have come back to get my phone.

296
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,220
If everyone knows that the Ice God is actually super sweet on the inside pretending to be cool,

297
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,030
what will they say?

298
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,370
Have you fallen for me then?

299
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,400
I've always loved you.

300
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,530
Chill. I won't tell anyone about it. I'll keep your secret.

301
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,160
It makes my stomach ache to have too much of your sweet displays of affection.

302
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,830
- Don't tell anyone.
- Don't worry.

303
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,550
Maybe some things are better if I tell her as soon as possible.

304
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,830
Maybe it's better to not tell him anything.

305
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,980
Tang Xue,

306
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,570
I wish you two a happy future.

307
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,290
Thank you, Yu Yan.

308
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,530
Your blessing really means a lot to me.

309
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,090
Maybe Li Yubing is the perfect one for you.

310
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,120
Even when you argue with each other, it still looks so right.

311
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,280
Maybe it's because we've known each other for a very long time.

312
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:41,880
Although we argue a lot, I really like him a lot.

313
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,900
Tang Xue.

314
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,390
You're here. Yu Yan is back.

315
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,910
Why the long face?

316
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,160
I'm afraid I've interrupted you two.

317
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,520
Yu Yan is sad about the loss. As his friend, I wanted to comfort him a little. Is that wrong?

318
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,760
Do you need to smile so sweetly to comfort a classmate?

319
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,100
Do you want to know what we talked about?

320
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,930
No.

321
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,530
I guess what I just told Yu Yan was exactly right.

322
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,880
I must've been blind to fall for someone that is so petty.

323
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,500
Really?

324
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,790
So you admit that you are petty?

325
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,810
No, did you really say that?

326
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,090
So petty.

327
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,740
Anyway, you can't smile so sweetly to other guys.

328
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,770
Not now, not ever.

329
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,560
Are you jealous?

330
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,320
Who's jealous?

331
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
Junior Zhou Ran!

332
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,900
Senior Deng, do you need something from me?

333
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,560
Nothing really.

334
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,840
I just want to tell you that I have been losing weight these days.

335
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,130
And… I'm jogging in a route shaped like this.

336
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,260
Is this the letter "R"?

337
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,240
Yes. It's the first letter of "Ran."

338
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,830
Senior, I'm flattered.

339
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,970
Junior, I've been losing weight

340
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,480
just so we can be a better match.

341
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,740
I have something that I always want to tell you.

342
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,980
I… I like you.

343
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,140
Can you give me an opportunity to care about you?

344
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,200
You…

345
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,800
Although it looks like a toad and swan when I stand next to you,

346
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,450
but the saying goes, "A toad that doesn't want the swan is not a good toad."

347
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,710
Senior, you are scaring me.

348
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,930
Sorry. I'm a bit emotional.

349
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,810
But Li Yubing is already with Tang Xue now.

350
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,070
It won't work between you two.

351
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,630
Junior, can you consider me?

352
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,660
Senior, I think you must've misunderstood.

353
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,010
Even if there's no Li Yubing, the two of us still wouldn't be possible.

354
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,870
Because I don't want to have a relationship.

355
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,080
I want to focus on studying.

356
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,010
So, I'm sorry, Senior.

357
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,430
I'm off. Bye-bye.

358
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,960
I will wait for you. When you change your mind,

359
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,510
please… come back and tell me.

360
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,950
Serenade, I expressed my love to the girl I love.

361
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,520
[Serenade, I expressed my love to the girl I love. She doesn't love me back.]

362
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,410
She doesn't love me back.

363
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,170
Unrequited love is doomed at the very beginning.

364
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,700
All doomed love will one day herald true love.

365
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,630
True love? Everyone talks about that.

366
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,830
What is true love then?

367
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,700
I think true love is

368
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,850
someone loves you for who you are.

369
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,000
With no disguise,

370
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,900
no matter if you are happy or sad, ugly or pretty.

371
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,290
Regardless of your appearance,

372
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,520
someone will see the sunshine in your heart.

373
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,370
True love is even if you are fat as a pig,

374
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:00,030
someone will find you in perfect shape and very endearing.

375
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,830
Just like Zhu Shenghao and Song Qingru.

376
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,070
I wish I can have this kind of love.

377
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,690
But this society that looks at appearances

378
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,840
is not friendly to me.

379
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,780
You will find it. As long as you look for it with your heart.

380
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,430
My heart?

381
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,370
Yes. Less cliche and be more real.

382
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,950
Your Song Qingru will feel it if you are real.

383
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,210
No matter how mediocre you are, she will see you.

384
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,140
Maybe she is on the way to meet you.

385
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,950
I hope she isn't directionally challenged and we can meet sooner.

386
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,940
I have a premonition.

387
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,230
She will be here very soon.

388
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,620
Time for breakfast!

389
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,240
Coming, coming!

390
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,100
Good for you.

391
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,610
I think after retiring, you can run a breakfast stall.

392
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,470
Probably.

393
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,260
Too hot.

394
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,990
Take it slow.

395
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,170
- It's crispy outside and soft inside. So delicious.
- So delicious.

396
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,570
It's just too hot. Bring me some tissue.

397
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,350
Sure.

398
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,990
It's a pity that Xiao Xue is not here.

399
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,520
This is my new invention of sugar pastry. She must love it.

400
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,010
I wonder if she is busy with school or not,

401
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,770
and if she's read the books I sent to her.

402
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,460
Old Tang, actually Xiao Xue…

403
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,540
I know. You want to tell me

404
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,990
not to worry about her.

405
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,620
Don't think too much. I know. It's all for the good of Xiao Xue.

406
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,770
You've said it hundreds of times. Come on, eat it while it's hot.

407
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,220
Read this article. This style.

408
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,860
Can you believe it was written by a freshman in college?

409
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,470
Bian Cheng. He is really talented.

410
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,120
I really need to praise him.

411
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,600
Is he that classmate of Xue'er?

412
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,610
Photographs of On-Ice Sports in LUU.

413
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,020
What's wrong? I'm telling you to read this paragraph.

414
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,250
Nothing. Keep eating.

415
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,840
Rooting for LUU.

416
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,230
[Dad]

417
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,800
Sorry, the number you dialed is busy. Please try again later.

418
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,610
Sorry, the number you dialed…

419
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,550
[Uncle Tang]

420
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,480
[Uncle Tang]

421
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,110
Hello, Uncle.

422
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,160
Do you need anything?

423
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,980
How is Tang Xue doing in school?

424
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,850
Tang Xue… She is fine.

425
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,310
In Bian Cheng's WeChat Moment,

426
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:00,600
I saw some photos of Tang Xue in a training uniform.

427
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,300
Do you know what's going on?

428
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,290
I'm really not quite sure.

429
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,440
Ran-ran, don't cover for her.

430
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,290
Tell me. We journalists

431
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,610
know how to protect the informant.

432
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,260
Besides, these pictures

433
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,550
were seen personally by me.

434
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,550
Okay. Tang Xue…

435
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,190
She has transferred to the sports college.

436
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,720
She's been in the short track speeding skating team since last semester.

437
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,370
Li Yubing and her are the widely known Ice Couple now.

438
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,820
Uncle, I actually shouldn't

439
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,600
tell you about this.

440
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,830
In the future, you can download the LUU app.

441
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,970
You will know everything then.

442
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,160
Don't get angry over this.

443
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,260
A lot of girls in college actually envy Tang Xue.

444
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,370
I called her.

445
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,280
She didn't answer.

446
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,650
Do you know where she is right now?

447
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,170
I… I don't know about that.

448
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,880
But she seems to hang out with Liao Zhenyu a lot.

449
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,330
You can ask him.

450
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,140
A good show is about to start.

451
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:21,640
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

452
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:29,080
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

453
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:35,470
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

454
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:41,940
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

455
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:48,180
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

456
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:55,400
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

457
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,090
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

458
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,890
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

459
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,820
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

460
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,100
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

461
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,050
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

462
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:24,110
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

463
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:30,440
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

464
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,790
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

465
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:43,400
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

466
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:49,750
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

467
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:55,940
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

468
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:03,420
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

469
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:09,960
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

470
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,930
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

471
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:22,030
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

472
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:29,030
♫ it is the signal you are giving me ♫

473
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:35,300
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

474
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:42,730
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

475
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:49,050
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

476
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:56,340
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

477
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:02,770
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

478
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,720
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

479
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,560
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
