[Episode 23]

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,900
Dear,

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,300
I just remembered something.

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,100
Actually, our son started showing signs a long time ago.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,400
What signs?

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
Since he was little, he's never

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
shown interest in girls.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
When he was in elementary school, his deskmate

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,400
was a girl called Tang Xue. Do you remember?

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Yeah.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,000
That little Tang Xue was so pretty

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
and smart. All their classmates liked her.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
But our Yubing didn't, and even told me he wanted to change deskmates.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,700
I asked him why.

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,000
He said "I just don't like Tang Xue."

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
So I asked, "Who do you want to be deskmates with?"

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,200
And he said... I don't remember, but it was a little boy.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,300
More importantly... did he switch deskmates?

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,500
I thought if I let him get a new deskmate just because he didn't like her, it would be coddling him too much.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,300
And it wouldn't help his social skills either, right?

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,200
So I didn't tell the teacher.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,800
I thought we'll see how it goes if the two kids spend more time together.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
But look what happened.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,700
Six years. Even after six years, they still didn't develop a friendship.

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,600
When they graduated, our son even lied to Tang Xue.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Even now, I'm still too embarrassed to see her parents.

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Now that I think about it, you're right.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,200
I remember our son was pretty popular when he entered middle school.

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,900
But I'd never heard of him being close with any girls.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,000
Dear, I still want to have grandkids.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
If we need to, we'll just have a second kid.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,900
You stop drinking starting tomorrow.

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,600
Dad. Mom. I'm going out.

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Yubing, where are you going?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm going out.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
- To where?
- To meet my friend.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
- Who?
- A classmate.

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,000
All of your answers are the same.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Mom, why are you questioning me as if questioning a thief?

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,400
- This won't do, I have to go and see.
- Wait.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,700
Change your clothes and shoes!

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,500
Hello? I'm leaving now. I'll see you at the beach.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,100
Follow that car.

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,100
- In front?
- Yes, that one.

62

♫ The blue sky is gently kissing the sunset glow ♫

63

♫ The warm coffee by the window sets off your side profile ♫

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,200
♫ Opening up the thick album with our cherished
photographs inside ♫

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
♫ That year’s winter, ♫

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the first.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The first what?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,800
The first New Year's I get to spend with you.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,200
It's not the first.

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,700
Here. Hold it! Hurry up.

71

♫ Snowflakes are falling, do you see them? ♫

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,100
In the future, let's always spend the New Year's together.

♫ Year after year, they stay by your side as a white fairy tale ♫

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm surprised you remember it so clearly.

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Let's spend it together next year, too.

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,000
And the year after that, and after that.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
And for many more years.

79

♫ To me, you are irreplaceable in this world ♫

81
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
This is our first official kiss.

82
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,900
You kidnapped my dinosaur and you still want to kiss me?

83
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,350
Should we...

84
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,300
try it again?

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,200
♫ The summer season filled with meteor showers
heard the star’s response ♫

This is great.

♫ Holding your hand so tightly, ♫

94
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,000
Kids, continue what you were doing.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,100
Dad. Mom?

96
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Auntie, it's been so many years, but you still look so young.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
No, I'm not.

98
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,000
Tang Xue, what a coincidence. Today, I even mentioned you to Yubing's dad.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
We've always really liked you.

100
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
When you were little, you were very clever and smart.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,300
Isn't that right, Dear?

102
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes! Yes.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Thank you for looking after me all those years. Looking back on it, I ate a lot of candy thanks to you.

104
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,900
If you like our food,

105
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,800
come over often. Auntie will cook for you anytime.

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,700
If you don't mind, you can even live in our house.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,100
What Uncle means is that our whole family welcomes you.

108
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,400
Yes, yes! We all welcome you.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,400
My parents said that it's late and I should head back soon.

110
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
- You're leaving so soon?
- We'll give you a ride.

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,200
- Yeah, we'll give you a ride.
- Uncle and Auntie, it's okay. I live right next door.

112
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
I'll head back now. Uncle and Auntie, goodbye.

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
- Take your time.
- Be careful on the way back.

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,840
How could you guys follow me?

115
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,000
We just wanted to see who you were dating. I never thought it'd be Tang Xue.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,300
Thank goodness it was Tang Xue. We thought it was Xu Feng.

117
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,400
What? Xu Feng?

118
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Did I do something to make you guys misunderstand me?

119
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,000
Isn't this all your fault?

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,700
You're a guy, what are you doing putting on eyeliner?

121
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,300
Exactly.

122
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,800
That eyeliner was because I lost a game. Tang Xue drew it on me.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
What about the pink dinosaur?

124
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
That's hers, too.

125
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Last time, you were talking to a male classmate,

126
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,900
and you said you were dating but couldn't tell the parents. What did that mean?

127
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,600
You guys even eavesdropped on my phone call?

128
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
Let's not discuss that right now. Answer my question.

129
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,000
That guy is Tang Xue's good friend.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
When I was little, I lied to Tang Xue. Right?

131
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
So I was trying to think of how to get her parents to forgive me.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,700
I was just asking for help.

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,300
Last question. What is your relationship with Xu Feng?

134
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,800
Xu Feng is also a hockey player; he's my idol. I was thinking that since it's New Year's,

136
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,400
he might come back to Hucheng. And I thought it'd be nice if I could see him.

137
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,600
Thank goodness it was all a misunderstanding. My son, do you know?

138
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,200
How worried we've been the last few days because of this? We've barely slept.

139
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,600
Look at my eye circles. And your mom was so scared of not having grandchildren.

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
She's started to force me to stop drinking.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,300
What does this have to do with drinking—

142
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,600
You— You guys wanted to have another kid?
(T/N: lit. you guys are responding to the call of the country?)

143
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
It's okay now.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,400
The misunderstanding is all cleared up. Your dad and I can stop worrying now.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,700
Tang Xue is a good girl. Be good to her, got it?

146
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,600
Your dad and I fully support you.

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,300
We completely support you.

148
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,000
Son, go buy some alcohol for us, so we can decompress.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
- Yes.
- The three of us must celebrate this.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,300
There you go again! Not being serious.

151
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Let's go home.

152
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,500
It's good they slept already. Or else, they'd definitely interrogate me.

153
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
Mom.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Where'd you go?

155
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,300
I went to see fireworks with my friend.

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,900
Xue'er, I know that you're training for short track speed skating again.

157
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,000
It's okay. Your dad's asleep already.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
How did you find out?

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
It's not important how I found out.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Actually, the past few days, I've been trying to find time to talk to you about this.

161
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Xue'er, since you were little, I've never stopped you

162
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,000
from doing the things you like to do.

163
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,900
But this time, I'm really worried about you.

164
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,400
Do you have to start skating again?

165
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,800
After I stopped skating, it was like I lost my soul.

166
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,400
I didn't find anything else

167
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,500
that made me feel interested or passionate.

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,400
So I've already applied to transfer departments.

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,000
- Starting next semester, I'll focus on short track speed skating.
- You–

170
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
How could you not consult with us about such a big decision?

171
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,400
If your dad knows, you're dead. You know that, right?

172
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,500
I really can't understand. What's wrong with studying veterinary medicine?

173
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,000
There's nothing wrong with it,

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
but I don't like it.

175
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Every day at school, as soon as class starts, I'm waiting for it to end.

176
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,000
But when someone mentions going skating, I'll feel completely energized.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
If I don't skate for one day, my whole body feels weird.

178
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,400
You– Do you understand that feeling?

179
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't understand. Aren't you scared of getting injured again?

180
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,500
I am scared. But for skating, I'm willing to pay the price.

181
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,000
It's okay if it's tiring, painful, or difficult.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't think any of these are a big problem. But for anything else, I can't do it.

183
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,900
The sense of accomplishment and joy

184
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,000
that skating brings me is something that none of the other majors can bring me.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Even our veterinary medicine professor encouraged me

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to go do what I'm passionate about, because you can only do something well when you love it.

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Is passionately loving it enough?

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Do you know how competitive athletes are?

189
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
How many athletes can become champions?

190
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,600
How many can stand at the very top? Do you know?

191
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
I know.

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,200
I really want to become a champion,

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,600
but what's more important to me is the journey of getting there.

194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,000
That's how much you love skating?

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Yes. Skating is my life.

196
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
I didn't know either, how much I loved skating.

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,600
But after I stopped skating, I realized how important it was to me.

198
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,500
In life, whichever path you choose,

199
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,600
it will be difficult.

200
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
You might as well choose the one you like.

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,600
At least you will enjoy the process of getting there.

202
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
Are you giving me your permission?

203
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,400
What do you think?

204
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
Thank you, Mom.

205
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,400
I love you to death.

206
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,500
To be honest, I'm really proud of you.

207
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,200
It's rare that you know so clearly what you want.

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,800
Life is like...

209
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,600
driving, taking a trip somewhere.

210
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Some people get in the car, but don't know where they want to go.

211
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,200
These people will just always be running around their entire life.

212
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,300
But the people who know where their destination is,

213
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,400
in just a short time,

214
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,600
they will get where they want to go.

215
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,400
The road you've chosen

216
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,000
is going to be full of hardships. It's like when you drive,

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,700
you can't only run into green lights.

218
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,800
There have to be some red lights along the way, too. But as long as you don't give up,

219
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,600
you will reach the place you want to go.

220
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,500
Although your dad and I will worry about you a lot,

221
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,500
and we are scared for you to get hurt again.

222
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,800
Daughter, you've grown up.

223
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,800
We need to learn to let go.

224
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,300
You decide your own life.

225
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,600
As long as your choices make you happy,

226
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,300
that's more than enough for us.

227
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
But there's one thing you have to remember.

228
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,800
In the future, no matter what happens,

229
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,700
you have to tell us.

230
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:33,000
Because we will always support you. We are your strongest backers.

231
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm sorry, Mom.

232
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,790
I made these big decisions without consulting you guys.

233
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,100
It's okay, it's okay.

234
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,100
You know your dad's personality, he has a stubborn temper.

235
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,800
Let's tell him slowly,.

236
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,900
I trust that one day, your dad will support you.

237
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Hello?

238
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Yubing? Are you dating someone?

239
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,000
Why do you say that?

240
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
Let me tell you... I have very sharp eyes.

241
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,200
None of you athletes can get anything past me.

242
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,500
You are the star player of the XDragons team.

243
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,800
I've been arranging so many sponsorships and endorsements for you.

244
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,500
Everyone's eyes are on you.

245
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Make sure you don't cause any scandals. It'll be very troublesome to clean up.

246
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
Got it.

247
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,400
Dating will distract you from training. That's a given. Right?

248
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,100
You only have so much concentration to give.

249
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,600
You are going uphill right now.

250
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,200
You don't have any time to spare for dating. Am I right?

251
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Let me tell–

252
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
Hello?

253
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,500
Hello?

254
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,900
Who was it?

255
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,380
A scam phone call.

256
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
Thanks.

257
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,100
You were saying that you told your mom about transferring departments.

258
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,800
My mom supports me.

259
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,000
But my dad still doesn't know. We're afraid he won't be able to accept it just yet,

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
so we've decided to slowly tell him.

261
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,960
I'm surprised Auntie is so supportive of what you want to do. She's very reasonable.

262
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,200
Of course. Why do you think she was able to birth such an amazing daughter?

263
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,600
Okay, let's head home early today. We're going back to school in a few days,

264
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,000
then we'll be able to hang out every day. We should spend more time with our parents while we can.

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,600
My little sugar cube is so responsible.

266
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
Let's go.

267
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,000
Tang Xue, are you done packing?

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah, I'm done!

269
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,800
You filled half a suitcase with clothes, and one and a half with snacks?

270
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,700
What are you doing? Are you going to Africa to save the refugees?

271
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,400
You have no idea how hungry I get every night.

272
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,500
Doesn't the school cafeteria serve three meals a day? If you're hungry at night...

273
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,000
what does that mean?

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,400
I expend a lot of energy every day. After practice—

275
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
Practicing for what?

276
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,300
That...

277
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,100
English.

278
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Next semester, I'm taking the CET4.
(College English Test Band 4)

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,300
She's learning English; it requires a lot of brain power so she gets hungry.

280
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,600
I didn't think of that.

281
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,400
- Wait here, I'll bring you some beef jerky.
- Okay.

282
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,200
I'll bring you half a box!

283
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,900
My god! You almost exposed yourself.

284
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
- Son.
- Mom.

285
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,300
Tomorrow, have your dad take you to the station.

286
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,100
It's okay, I can go on my own.

287
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I know you guys are busy, I'll go by myself.

288
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,300
I want to stay at home with you tomorrow. Just let him be independent for once.

289
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,200
Your independence talk again. He can't be independent if you take him to the train station?

290
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
[Tang Xue]

291
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,050
I almost accidentally told my dad

292
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,500
about skating training just now.

293
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,400
Did you recover?

294
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,300
Of course, I'm a quick thinker.

295
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,200
I'll see you at the station tomorrow then.

296
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
My dad insists on taking me to the station tomorrow.

297
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,200
If anything, let's just come clean. We can't hide everything from him.

298
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,400
That's true.

299
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,500
With your dad's temper, it'd probably be worse if he found out we were hiding it.

300
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,400
Then it's agreed. We'll confess together tomorrow. I prefer ripping the band-aid off anyway.

301
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,700
Li Yubing.

302
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
What a coincidence. Did you guys agree to leave together?

303
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
It-It's a coincidence.

304
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,140
I'm going to buy some water, should I buy some for Uncle and Auntie as well?

305
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,100
Why are you talking like that?

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
What's going on?

307
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
He's leaving with you? You guys definitely planned this!

308
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
It's a coincidence.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,900
Coincidence.

310
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,210
That's good then.

311
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,700
Xiao Xue,

312
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Dad isn't opposed to you having a boyfriend,

313
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,800
but your boyfriend can't be Li Yubing.

314
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,500
That's enough. Let her handle her own matters, okay?

315
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,500
Dad, the matter after elementary school was so long ago.

316
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,000
Just let it go.

317
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,600
I've already let that go.

318
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
What I'm worried about now is your present.

319
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,800
As far as I know, Li Yubing plays hockey at school. Right?

320
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,600
Hockey is such a dangerous sport.

321
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
If you guys date and he gets permanently injured,

322
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
he'll just slow you down.

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,200
It's the same as you training for short track speed skating.

324
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,600
I'll say it again, I really don't want to live in fear.

325
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,800
That's enough from you. Everything is dangerous these days.

326
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,000
For example, if you're walking down the street, a vase can fall on your head.

327
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,800
Exactly.

328
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,600
That's enough. She has to have some kind of hobby.

329
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,000
Fine, just do it as a hobby then.

330
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,800
It's almost time. You should get going.

331
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
You guys can go home now.

332
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,900
Uncle and Auntie, here's some water.

333
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,200
You really didn't have to.

334
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,700
I'm not thirsty.

335
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll drink it! Give it to me.

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
- Here, Auntie.
- Okay, okay.

337
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
- I'll get going too then.
- Okay, goodbye. Safe travels.

338
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,900
Uncle and Auntie, goodbye.

339
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,800
Look how polite he is, and you still rejected him.

340

[Hucheng to/from Lincheng]

341
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,220
Didn't we agree to come clean today? Why didn't you tell him?

342
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,400
You didn't say it either.

343
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,130
I just thought today was going to be a sure fail so I didn't dare say anything.

344
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,300
It's a good thing you didn't. My dad doesn't just disapprove of me skating again,

345
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,460
he disapproves of my other half being a hockey player, too.

346
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,940
If he found out I was completely going against him,

347
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,700
he would get on the bus right now and follow us all the way to the sports college.

348
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,020
He would immediately force me to transfer back to the veterinary medicine department.

349
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,050
He wouldn't really do that, would he?

350
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,820
I think we should give it more time.

351
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,230
I should at least enter a tournament, win a medal, and prove myself first.

352
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,820
I think that would make it easier for him to accept.

353
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,330
Okay, hopefully, we can make it to that day with no issues.

354
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,210
Why is your dad only like that to me?

355
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,000
Look how nice he is to Bian Cheng, compared to me.

356
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,950
You're just not his type.

357
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
- In any case, you're my type.
- My neck, my neck hurts.

358
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,010
The king is back. Receive him.

359
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,590
Did you guys miss me when I was gone?

360
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,650
What do you think?

361
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,260
Where a rose stops, the fragrance lingers.

362
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,640
I get it. Even though I wasn't here,

363
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
your longing only became more intense.

364
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,960
Master Tang, that's impressive.

365
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,670
You're the only person who didn't learn anything after hanging out with a genius student so much.

366
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,020
After you register since returning to school, meet at the training center today at 4:00 p.m.

367
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,830
I'm going to the sports college to register, let's talk when I'm back!

368
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,660
Hey!

369
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,780
Follow me.

370
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,190
Why are you being so secretive?

371
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,900
Before I win a tournament, we can't let anyone know about our relationship.

372
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,950
Why?

373
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,730
You're the one that said Coach Chu doesn't allow dating.

374
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,790
Maybe she's not as strict anymore, don't you think?

375
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,240
How do you know?

376
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,090
Okay, but we can at least talk normally. Right?

377
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,020
We were fine before. You're making it even more suspicious by acting like this.

378
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,040
That's true.

379
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,330
But you're aware, too, that I don't have a backup plan.

380
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
If I don't win a tournament, how will I prove to my dad?

381
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,700
By then, just wait and see how our relationship will get ripped apart.

382
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,930
Okay.

383
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,090
I'll listen to Master Tang.

384
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,970
Good boy. Let's go.

385
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,390
Before the break, I reminded everyone to maintain their condition.

386
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,560
During the break, you can't relax.

387
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,460
Were you guys just pretending to listen?

388
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,770
Who listened to me, and who was lazy,

389
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,640
your performance will show all of it.

390
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,350
Those who got slower, who lost muscle,

391
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,440
all treated my words like the wind blowing past them.

392
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,780
The days without the Iron Hammer training you,

393
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,100
it seems like you guys had a great time.

394
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,320
You had big feasts every day,

395
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,580
you dated.

396
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,920
It's okay if you block me from your Wechat Moments.

397
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,830
Your performance will not lie for you.

398
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,090
Today, out of everyone, only Zhang Yuewei and Tang Xue are worthy of praise.

399
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:10,170
Their performance actually improved, and they maintained their condition well.

400
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,470
Starting this semester, Tang Xue is officially in the sports college.

401
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,890
She is officially a member of the short track speed skating team.

402
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,230
She used her ability and her attitude to prove herself.

403
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,360
Welcome Tang Xue to the team.

404
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,560
This semester, the competitions are tough and you'll have important missions to accomplish.

405
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,560
I will only reserve the opportunities

406
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,380
for those who are the most outstanding. You can weigh your own priorities.

407
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,800
Don't come crying to me later on.

408
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,130
Next, I'll talk about the plan for tomorrow.

409
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,450
Tomorrow is the XDragons Club collective team building activity.

410
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,940
The figure skating team is at a competition and can't make it this time.

411
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,190
So, tomorrow, it'll be the short track speed skating team with the ice hockey team.

412
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,910
I want to remind everyone: make sure to be on time tomorrow.

413
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,650
When we're out, be safe, and follow the rules.

414
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,160
We need to show the positive side of the short track speed skating team. Got it?

415
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,530
Got it!

416
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,760
Okay, dismissed.

417
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,670
- Thanks, Coach!
-,Thanks, Coach!

418
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,020
What's the team-building activity?

419
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,570
We're camping, having a picnic, and doing other group activities.

420
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,870
- It sounds so fun.
- Yeah.

421
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,040
Be careful.

422
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,110
Sugar Cube, I miss you.

423
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,650
Dog, I miss you, too.

424
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,980
I want to sit next to you.

425
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,320
The coaches are both here. If you dare, come sit with me.

426
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,850
I have a way to have the coaches ask us to sit together.

427
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,030
You're bluffing.

428
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,830
Watch this.

429
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,310
Coach Xu.

430
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,790
- What?
- Look.

431
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,770
Coach Chu is asleep.

432
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,830
I see that. What about it?

433
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,340
Do you know what a head that has nowhere to settle needs right now?

434
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,010
What?

435
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,170
A warm shoulder to rest on.

436
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,610
Think about when she wakes up and sees you next to her.

437
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,040
- Will it work?
- Of course.

438
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,920
Let's do it.

439
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,910
Little Tang Xue, let's switch seats.

440
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,040
But Coach Chu asked me to sit with her.

441
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,950
I knew you were a smart one.

442
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,220
Everyone, gather round.

443
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,760
Everyone, over here.

444
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,850
Students, today is this semester's XDragons Club

445
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,390
first team-building activity for the On-Ice programs.

446
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,740
Who can tell me what most important is when you're on a trip?

447
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,020
Being happy!

448
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,480
Wrong. It's safety.

449
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,840
You are athletes. You need to always keep this in mind, got it?

450
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,050
Got it!

451
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,560
Being happy is also important.

452
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,710
- But safety is even more important.
- Yes!

453
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:05,740
We finally made it here. Everyone put your luggage down and let's play a game to warm up.

454
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,870
Great!

455
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,430
- I'll go over there.
- Hey.

456
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,920
What?

457
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,530
Thanks.

458
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,710
For what?

459
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,450
I can tell you've been working out your delts.

460
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,020
I train them every day.

Three words.

The first word is five.
(Sounds like Wu)

469
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,730
The second word is big. Wu Dajing!

- It's okay. It's just a small injury.

Wei-wei, no matter how strong you are, you're still a girl at the end of the day.

539
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,880
Don't actually think of yourself as a strong man.

It's okay. Brother Wei has it covered. Let's go.

545
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,590
A long, long time ago, there was a very, very poor mountain village.

546
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,440
There was only one family, which had only two people.

547
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,980
An old man and an old woman.

548
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,490
They were so poor that getting food every day to eat was a struggle.

549
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,110
On one night, when they were fast asleep,

550
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,240
they heard a noise outside that went cling-clang, cling clang as if someone had walked by

551
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,480
and walked into the kitchen. Cling-clang, cling-clang, cling-clang...

552
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,070
The next day, the old man woke up

553
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,350
to find that his pot

554
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,460
had breakfast in it. He was very astonished.

555
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,460
Who did this?

556
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,870
Another day passed, the old man woke up to use the restroom.

557
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,290
Back then, toilets were outside,

558
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,590
and then, at the same time,

559
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,600
he finally saw

560
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,840
who this person was.

561
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,710
From a far distance away,

562
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:09,010
he slowly walked towards the old man's house...

563
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,230
Are you mad at me? Why do you keep avoiding me?

564
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm not.

565
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,040
Why do you keep avoiding me then? Is it because of the game that made you angry?

566
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,210
I admit...

567
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,460
that it's because I was a little too happy when I played the game.

568
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,070
I smiled a little too wide. When I hugged her, I was a little too intimate.

569
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,310
I'm sorry.

570
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,440
Isn't it just a game?

571
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,450
Do I seem like I'm that stingy to you?

572
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,180
Then, why do you keep avoiding me if you're not jealous?

573
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,780
I've already told you multiple times,

574
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,670
don't be too intimate in front of the others.

575
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,730
You can't be like this before I get a medal.

576
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,100
Every time you see me, it's like you're a dog that saw a bone.

577
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,280
All right. You're actually not jealous.

578
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,170
- You're definitely not a normal woman.
- Of course, I'm not!

579
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,630
You're a normal man.

580
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,510
Ah!!!

581
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,630
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- You scared me to death!

582
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,230
You scared the life out of me!

583

584
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,610
Wei-wei!

585
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,640
There's no signal in the mountains. Wei-wei!

Oh, no. She doesn't know the way around here.

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,570
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

625
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:48,630
♫ it is the signal you are giving me ♫

626
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:54,860
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

627
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:02,340
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

628
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:08,550
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

629
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:15,700
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

630
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:22,390
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

631
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,260
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

632
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,970
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
