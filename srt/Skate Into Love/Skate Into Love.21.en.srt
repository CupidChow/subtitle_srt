00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,260
Bian Cheng, my uncle is the chief editor at Hucheng Daily News. He's quite impressive.

161
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,780
So you're the chief editor at Hucheng Daily News?

162
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,110
Have you heard of it?

163
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,150
I've not only heard about it, but I've also read it.

164
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,850
I've always felt that Hucheng Daily News delivers not just news, but also a form of thinking.

165
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,540
I think this is something that the younger generation of Journalism should study.

166
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,760
I rarely see people think like you.

167
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,750
Even the younger people who have worked at our publication office for two years wouldn't be able to think of that.

168
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,040
Newbies like us have plenty of theories instead of practice.

169
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,760
I still have many questions that I'm hoping I could discuss with you in the future, Uncle Tang.

170
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,520
That's rare. A humble child like you who's eager to learn is hard to come by now.

171
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,370
Something smells good!

172
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,360
You smelled it?

173
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,410
You little glutton. The meat's almost done.

174
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,090
- You two sit first.
- Okay.

175
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,080
You're working too hard, Auntie.

176
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,790
- Not hard at all!
- Aunt!

177
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,260
Bian Cheng, keep chatting with my uncle. I'll go help.

178
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,700
Aunt.

179
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,270
I'll help you.

180
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,610
Ran-ran, you're so thoughtful. If only your younger cousin could be like you, that would be great.

181
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,390
- Thank you.
- No need for thanks.

182
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,930
Tang Xue is very excellent herself. She's starting to skate again.

183
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,010
Once again, everyone in the family is going to surround the television to watch her compete.

184
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,300
What did you say? Did you say that Xiao Xue is starting to practice short track speed racing again?

185
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,560
No way! She didn't tell the family about this important matter?

186
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,850
This child...

187
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,930
Let me tell you. Ran-ran, you cannot let your uncle know about this. If he hears about this, the situation will be very bad.

188
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,720
Okay, okay.

189
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,520
This child...

190
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,110
Uncle Tang,

191
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,850
I strongly agree with your principles.

192
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,650
I think the professionalism of journalism is Hucheng Daily News' soul.

193
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,910
The public has exceedingly high expectations for journalists' social morality.

194
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,690
And so, journalists must stick with the principles

195
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,820
in order to publish thoughtful news of integrity.

196
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,830
That way they can stay calm and truthful around hot issues and maintain the media's integrity.

197
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,710
It's no wonder that you're one of the top students at MU.

198
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,360
You're so young, yet you understand to stick to your principles.

199
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,530
Many people in the industry now don't understand what new is. News is a mirror!

200
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,950
It reflects the truths of society,

201
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,020
and doesn't only look to create buzz.

202
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,060
Yes.

203
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,250
Bian Cheng, would you like to help our publication office write articles?

204
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,810
Can I?

205
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,740
You wouldn't dislike our small newspaper, would you?

206
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,130
Of course not. I'm overjoyed.

207
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,210
I am, too!

208
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,650
- Keep talking.
- Uncle, what are you two talking about that's making you so happy?

209
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,970
Ran-ran, this young man has a great future ahead of him.

210
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,850
Then you two keep talking. I'll go in to help Aunt.

211
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,270
Okay.

212
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,350
Here. Have some tea in place of wine.

213
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,170
Master Tang, are you better?

214
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,760
Take your medications, drink water, and get lots of sleep.

215
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,510
Li Yubing.

216
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,820
What are you doing? Are you even looking at my Moments?

217
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,960
The whole world has seen it. Only you haven't seen it. I only posted it so you could see it, Li Yubing.

218
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,590
What are you doing?

219
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,690
Then it's settled. After the new year, you'll intern at Uncle's publication office and write articles.

220
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,620
You'll get royalties.

221
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,770
- Okay. I'll try my best.
- Good, good.

222
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,710
Sit here. I'll go open the door.

223
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,060
Okay.

224
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,210
Hello, Uncle.

225
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,420
Li Yubing?

226
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,490
I heard Tang Xue was sick, so I'm here to visit her.

227
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,750
I wonder if she's doing better.

228
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,580
It's nothing too serious. She already went to bed.

229
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,720
- You should go back for now.
- Uncle–

230
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,890
Li Yubing,

231
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,560
you're here.

232
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,330
You came, too?

233
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,170
Bian Cheng, let's go back and keep talking.

234
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay, Uncle Tang.

235
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,900
Li Yubing,

236
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,290
tomorrow morning at ten at Hunter Cafe, I have something to tell you.

237
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,410
Okay. Uncle, then this...

238
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,830
No need.

239
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,520
Was that Li Yubing?

240
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,900
Don't go.

241
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,980
Why not? Why didn't you let him come in?

242
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,480
Because you're sick.

243
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,770
Isn't  he  here as well?

244
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,470
Because Li Yubing is not honest.

245
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,310
[Honesty]

246
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,200
[Huan-huan]

247
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,540
My dear young lady, I called you so many times. Where are you that you can't even pick up my calls?

248
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,860
I've gone to learn wizardry in the mountains.

249
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,360
What wizardry?

250
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,870
Clairvoyance.

251
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,560
Yeah, and I'm all-knowing.

252
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,970
You don't believe me, do you? I'll show you.

253
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,100
Are you wearing a purple shirt

254
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,850
and a pair of white pants? Did you just buy them?

255
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,860
And you're drinking coffee while reading a book.

256
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,570
You sure are living comfortably.

257
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,290
Xiao Xia! You–

258
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,720
You're saying Li Yubing went to First Middle School to avoid me, not because his parents divorced?

259
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,530
You're definitely mistaken.

260
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,260
Back then, he was with me every day. If he wanted to avoid me, he would have done so earlier.

261
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,540
He seems to had considered transferring schools.

262
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,940
I will ask him myself.

263
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,460
I just took my medication. I'm sleepy.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,980
You two sit first.

265
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,520
Bian Cheng, why don't we leave first?

266
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,540
Uncle, you should let Tang Xue calm down.

267
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,260
The food's all ready, and you two haven't eaten yet.

268
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,990
It's fine, Uncle Tang. I'll come and visit you again in the future.

269
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,780
That's good, too.

270
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,240
Uncle, you don't need to walk us out.

271
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,980
Okay.

272
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,270
Bian Cheng, come visit often when you have time.

273
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,040
Okay. Goodbye, Uncle Tang.

274
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,220
Okay, goodbye.

275
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,680
Xue'er, it's me.

276
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Those matters were all in the past. You don't have to keep thinking about them.

277
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,300
There's nothing to think about.

278
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,500
If he wants to avoid me, go ahead. He doesn't like me, and I don't like him.

279
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,000
Xiao Xue, there's something...

280
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,700
You still have a fever. Sleep. You'll feel better when you wake up.

281
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
What's wrong?

282
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,200
Actually, seeing Tang Xue unhappy makes me feel bad, too.

283
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,200
What's wrong with you?

284
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Growing up, my cousin and I have always fought with each other.

285
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,800
But seeing her today, I feel a bit bad.

286
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,300
But your opportunity is here.

287
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,000
When a woman is fragile and vulnerable, the thing she needs most is consolation.

288
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,700
Li Yubing brought those.

289
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,800
It's very obvious that my uncle does not like Li Yubing.

290
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,000
So, your plan to please Tang Xue's father is very successful.

291
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,900
Hello? You're awake? I was afraid you were sleeping, so I didn't call you.

292
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,300
Li Yubing.

293
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,400
Back then, you went to First Middle School, not because of your parents' divorce,

294
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,900
but because you wanted to avoid me. Is that right?

295
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
You know everything?

296
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,800
Is it true?

297
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,500
Yes.

298
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,830
Why?

299
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,900
Didn't we get along quite well back then?

300
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Are you still the Li Yubing that used to play with me?

301
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,800
If you didn't want to go with me, why didn't you tell me?

302
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,400
Why did you still promise to go to Sixth Middle School with me?

303
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,600
I don't understand.

304
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,300
Because...

305
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Because I was scared of you.

306
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Scared of me?

307
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,200
Because back then, you were too overbearing.

308
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
I was timid, too.

309
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,200
I was too scared to tell you anything.

310
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
I was afraid I would be in trouble if you were mad.

311
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,300
Li Yubing, you don't have to be scared of me anymore.

312
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,600
We won't see each other again.

313
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Tang Xue.

314
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,200
Scared of me?

315
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,800
When did I become someone like that?

316
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,700
What kind of person am I to other people?

317
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,400
This is what Tang Xue wanted me to return to you the year you two graduated from elementary school.

318
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Excuse me.

319
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,800
Sorry. Let's take a look.

Where's Li Yubing?

322
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,400
- Hello?
- Hey, Mrs. Li.

323
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Hello.

324
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Today's the first day? How come you're not here?

325
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
We're here!

326
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,100
You're here, too?

327
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,900
How come I haven't seen you?

328
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,000
We're right here.

329
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,600
We're in Class One, what about you?

330
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,800
We're also in Class One. This time, they get to be classmates again.

331
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,600
It's fate.

332
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,800
How about I talk to the teacher and have them sit together again?

333
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
Okay.

334

Mrs. Li.

335
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Is Li Yubing attending Sixth Middle School?

336
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
Sixth Middle School?

337
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Didn't Tang Xue say she wanted to go to First Middle School?

338
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,500
Li Yubing said they agreed to go to First Middle School together.

339
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,200
That's all for now. I'm going to hang up.

Xiao Xue.

341
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,900
Li Yubing was planning on attending Sixth Middle School.

342
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,200
But his parents suddenly divorced,

343
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,900
so he had no choice but to follow his mother

344
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,800
and move to a different district.

345
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,000
You know that registration is based on district,

346
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,700
so he... so he can't come to Sixth Middle School.

347
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,100
Li Yubing can't do anything about it.

348
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,500
He was too shy to tell you.

349
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,800
I was only able to find out about this after asking around.

350
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,800
You should pretend you don't know anything, understood?

351
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Understood.

352
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,800
Turns out Li Yubing is so pitiful.

353
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,400
Help me return this to him.

354
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
This...

355
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,900
This is something I took from him.

356
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,500
But his parents divorced, I should return it to him.

357
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,800
I've never seen my daughter so depressed.

358
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
For the next two years,

359
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,400
she would always mention your name.

360
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,400
She would always say, "My good friend and I got separated."

361
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,080
Sorry, Uncle.

362
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
Back then,

363
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
I came up with this stupid idea of avoiding her because I was scared of Tang Xue.

364
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,200
I didn't think she would be this sad.

365
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,300
I understand my daughter the most.

366
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,000
If she hurt you before,

367
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,900
I apologize in her stead.

368
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,200
No, no, no, Uncle.

369
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,400
Actually, the one who should apologize is me, and back then we were still kids.

370
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,600
We were immature, but now we're older.

371
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,600
So, I feel differently about some things.

372
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,900
Differently?

373
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,500
I now... really like Tang Xue.

374
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,800
As a man, the most important thing

375
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,400
- is to keep your promises.
- You're right.

376
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,300
The old saying has it, you can tell what a person is like in his 80s from his behaviors at 7 years old.

377
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,100
How do you expect Xiao Xue to trust you after what you did?

378
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,800
Uncle, I will prove everything with my actions. Trust me.

379
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,200
Ever since you two separated, you two have already become distant.

380
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,700
Memories are the old pictures in an old photo album.

381
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,200
When you want to look at them, you take them out to take a look,

382
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,700
then you put them back.

383
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,600
Do what you should be doing.

384
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Uncle. Uncle!

385
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,900
No wonder Master Tang thought your parents divorced and was always taking your feelings into consideration.

386
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,500
If I had known this was going to happen, I would have told her myself.

387
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,600
Now that her father told her, I've completely become a liar.

388

What's happened has happened.

389
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,200
If you were Master Tang, what would you do?

390
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,460
Think of all possible ways to solve this.

391
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm going to hang up for now. I'll talk to you later.

392
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
- You're getting braver and braver, aren't you?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I've only been spending time with you these past few days. I need to go find Master Tang.

395
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,400
Forget it. Let Master Tang have some time to herself. She hasn't been in a good mood recently.

396
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,900
What?

397
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,800
What's wrong?

398
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,800
I don't know why Master Tang is in a bad mood.

399

is normal, isn't it?

You're still on his side?

413
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,550
Master Tang, don't be sad. When we go back to school, I'll take revenge on him.

414
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,100
I'll... I'll let the air out of his bicycle tires.

415

Let's just ignore him in the future,

so that he will live out the rest of his life feeling regret for not being forgiven.

I think, maybe you should consider Yu Yan?

What?

Are you two forced to call me Master Tang because you're afraid of me,

423
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,440
but in reality, you're unwilling to?

we won't ever be separated.

You finished making it?

My daughter's pulled chicken noodle.

Her favorite. Let me tell you, I also made you assorted vegetables.

438
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,620
The tree fungus will help with your immune system, and the vegetables give you more nutrients.

439

That way my daughter will recover faster, isn't that true?

440

Look at you. I have nothing to say. You spoil her too much.

- Old Zhao has a few cardiovascular problems.

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,280
Say summer.

475
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,280
Write down your name.

476
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,870
Put it in an envelope.

477
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,320
Take it down the hill to the box.

478
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,380
When you open my letter.

479
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,090
You will recall.

480
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,420
Those days.

481
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,000
And!

482
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,170
Bian Cheng?

483
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,850
How much, just how much, I love you.

484
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,990
It's a poem from American poet Raymond Carver. I adapted it.

485
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,600
This is for you.

486
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,910
Don't feel rushed to respond.

487
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,290
Do you still remember this place?

488
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,900
Tang Xue, back then,

489
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,100
this is where you gave me that letter.

490
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,040
I know. I once missed an opportunity.

491
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,710
But I still believe that one's first feelings of love will be always be engraved in one's heart.

492
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,190
It won't disappear easily with the wind.

493
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:25,190
Be together! Be together!

494
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,620
Be together! Be together!

495
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,170
Be together! Be together!

496
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,990
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

497
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:11,410
