I haven't even asked you about this yet, don't get me started.

Me? I came to listen to the speech.

105
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
You clearly knew I had plans to come and watch with Tang Xue,

106
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,120
yet you chose to sit next to us. You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

107
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,900
Can you share with us what kind of difficulties you're endured?

108
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,000
At that time, my endurance wasn't very good.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,700
When I first entered the national team,

110
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,600
I was just a training partner for the women's' short track speed skating team.

111
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,000
In long track speed skating, I lost to Zhou Yang, and in short track, I lost to Fan Kexin.
(T/N: both are Chinese speed skaters and Olympic medalists)

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,300
So, as a male athlete, I felt very sad and frustrated every day.

113
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,600
But every day, I held it in, went to practice, and gave it my all.

114
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,800
In the end, my hard work paid off and I got a chance to compete.

115
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,000
I even won a silver medal. Eventually, I won a gold medal.

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,100
So I want to tell everyone, don't easily let go of your dreams.

117
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Don't be afraid of hardship, take charge and go for it.

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,500
I like Tang Xue.

125

I believe this was just an accident, I'm sure everyone will forget about it very soon.

126
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,940
Tang Xue, this incident is at least half your fault. Didn't you say you would come? Where were you?

127
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,380
If there's anyone to blame for this, it's you.

128
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,800
- My fault?
- It's because of you that I was always late or missing class.

129
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,430
That's why Hawkeye made me stay after class. I almost couldn't graduate because of you!

What's more...

131
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,410
You were the one who made Ice God into Awkward God. Why are you trying to blame someone else?

132
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,660
Tang Xue, I'm sorry.

133
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,290
It's all our fault that you couldn't listen to the rest of the speech.

134
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,150
It's okay, I already met Senior and said hi to him.

You have to apologize to him today.

138
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,160
I'm also a victim here, okay?

139
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,630
There's no way I'm apologizing to you.

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,890
If he bullies you, tell me.

159
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,550
Nothing has changed since you were little. You're still making sure justice is served.

160
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,120
You still haven't told me.

161
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,800
Do you like Tang Xue or not?

162
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,190
Whether I like her isn't important.

163
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,110
To Tang Xue,

164
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,470
you're just a kid.

165
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,140
It's fine. She won't consider you anyway.

166
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,830
Li Yubing, I don't know how things will turn out,

167
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,550
but I'm going to give it my all.

168
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,320
I haven't heard from you in so long, did you forget about me?

169
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Of course not. Am I really that ungrateful?

170
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,300
You took such good care of me back then, how could I forget? It's just that...

171
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,640
I haven't skated in two years and you're a world champion already.

172
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,220
How could I face you?

173
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,580
You've improved, too.

174
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,070
What improvement?

175
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,960
Now you're the junior of a world champion.

176
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,580
So as long as you improve, it's enough?

177
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,590
What are you studying now?

178
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm in the veterinary medicine department.

179
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,290
Veterinarian?

180
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,020
Are you looking down on vets? If your pets need medical care later, I'll treat them for free. How's that?

181
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,970
I don't have any pets, and even if I did, I wouldn't let you treat them.

182
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,440
You're really not skating anymore?

183
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,820
I just joined our school's short track speed skating team this year.

184
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,750
Really?

185
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,710
I knew you wouldn't give up that easily.

186
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,540
Especially since I have you as an example.

187
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,490
It's been so long since we've seen each other, let's have a little competition.

188
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,930
Who's scared of who?

189
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,420
I really haven't practiced in so long, I'm so slow now.

190
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,920
World champion, do you accept defeat?

191
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,110
You eat corn faster than you skate, how can I not be okay with losing?

192
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,670
How come I don't feel like you're complimenting me? Old rules still apply, you pay.

193
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,980
This is for you. I hope you continue to work hard.

194
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,130
Bring out this same attitude of refusing to admit defeat,

195
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,120
and quickly join the national team.

196
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
Then you'll have to welcome me when I get there.

197
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,990
I'll welcome you with corn.

198
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,230
- It's a promise.
- It's a promise.

199
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,930
To Tang Xue, you're just a kid.

200
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,190
Hello?

201
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,430
Hello, Yan-yan?

202
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,220
How have you been recently?

203
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,390
Same as always.

204
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,530
You sound kind of down. Is practice too tiring?

205
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,160
Maybe.

206
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,190
Coach Jin told me recently that

207
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,060
he wants you to exceed your limits, so he's increasing the difficulty of your training.

208
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,280
I think you can definitely do it. Right?

209
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,030
No problem.

210
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,920
Why do I feel like your mindset is not right?

211
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,850
You sound so tired, not motivated at all.

212
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,460
Yan-yan, for an athlete, the most important thing is your mindset.

213
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,570
Do you remember when you were little? You loved figure skating so much.

214
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,980
At that time, when you won a competition, you'd hug your trophy and sleep with it for a whole night.

215
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,620
You were able to get to where you are today because of that mindset.

216
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,080
You can't let go of this dedication. You're still young.

217
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,690
I'm already 18 years old, I'm not a child anymore. How come none of you understand that?

218
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,640
Look at how you're talking to your mom.

219
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,770
I'll say it again. I'm not a child anymore.

220
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,730
I'm going to rest now. I'm hanging up.

221
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:01,700
Yu Yan, you're not a child. You're a mature adult now.

222
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,130
Regardless if you admit it or not. Anyhow, I admit it. I like Tang Xue.

223
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,950
If you want to compete in a fair game,

224
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,620
I welcome you anytime.

225
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,770
To Tang Xue, you're just a kid.

226
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,860
It's fine. She won't consider you anyway.

227
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,580
Li Yubing, I don't know how things will turn out,

228
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,850
but I'm going to give it my all.

229
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,970
You can do it. Shoot!

230
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm afraid I'll miss.

231
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,950
Xiao Dong, basketball is like people. You have to understand its heart.

232
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,110
If you have enough faith in it, it will definitely go the way you want it to.

233
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,720
Come on, you can do it. Shoot!

234
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,860
You got this, let's keep going.

235
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm leaving for Harbin tomorrow to participate in the national youth team training.

236
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,850
Can you come and see me off? No, no, I can't say it like that.

237
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,270
It sounds like I'm begging her to come.

238
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,450
The Ice God is leaving for the national youth team training tomorrow. Come see me off.

239
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,620
No, no, that's too stiff. Participating in the national youth team training...

240
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,900
come see me off, you come to...

241
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,980
Come see me off. Okay, that's good.

242
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,070
You're too nervous!

243
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,750
Why are you here?

244
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,040
I heard you were doing extra training tonight, so I came to visit.

245
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,800
Coach Chu said, with my current performance, I won't be able to stay on the team.

246
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,260
I watched you for a while earlier.

247
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,040
I think your limbs are too stiff.

248
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,150
When we practice figure skating, the first thing we do is relax and loosen our limbs.

249
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,380
This way, our movements are more fluid.

250
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,380
I think it's also because I haven't trained for so long.

251
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,560
I think you're in too much of a rush; you have too much going on in your head.

252
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,890
I have an idea, but I'm not sure if it'll help. Do you want to try it out?

253
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,400
Close your eyes.

254
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,550
Why?

255
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,580
Just do as I say.

256
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,100
Now, forget your goal.

257
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,740
About joining the short track speed skating team,

258
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,470
wanting to skate faster, forget about all of it.

259
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,970
Remember the time when you first started skating.

260
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,720
Remember what it was like to encounter the ice.

261
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,750
It's like in swimming,

262
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,190
when a person is embraced by the water.

263
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,710
Relax your body.

264
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,600
You and the ice are one.

265
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,700
Now, stretch your limbs,

266
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,080
feel the freedom,

267
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,890
the whole ice is yours.

268
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,930
You need to let go of your heavy burden before you can truly start over.

269
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,000
Do you trust me?

270
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:56,080
♫ The blue sky is gently kissing the sunset glow ♫

271
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,280
♫ The warm coffee by the window sets off your side profile ♫

272

♫ The wishing bottle is waiting for the spring rain,
wondering if the seed will sprout ♫

275

276

♫ Snowflakes are falling, do you see them? ♫

277
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:47,170
♫ Holding your hand so tightly, it’s warm that I’m melting ♫

278
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,100

286
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,830
Yu Yan!

287
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,010
How come you're here, too?

288
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,860
Yu Yan, Coach Jin is looking for you.

289
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,770
You should go quickly.

290
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,370
Okay.

291
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,500
Your face is so long, you look like a Scottish terrier.

292
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,780
I'll bite you.

293
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,570
Go away.

294
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,300
Are you done practicing? If you're done, let's go.

295
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,030
Yu Yan just taught me a method for relaxing my body, I want to try it again.

296
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,190
Yu Yan, Yu Yan, all you talk about is Yu Yan.

297
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,480
Do you like Yu Yan?

298
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,680
If I don't like him...

299
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,080
should I like you instead?

300
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,440
Tomorrow, I'm leaving for Harbin to participate in the national youth team training.

301
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,270
Good for you, Li Yubing. You're joining the national youth team? How long will you be gone for?

302
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,880
It's not for that long.

303
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,260
Make sure you practice well. Don't be...

304
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,010
Don't waste time dating or anything like that.

305
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,380
How is that any of your business?

306
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,330
It's not just me saying this. This is Coach Chu's rules.

307
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,720
Don't worry about me. Just worry about yourself.

308
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm going to watch your game.

309
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,270
Tomorrow, Master Tang will see you off.

310
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,300
Tang Xue!

311
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,460
Why are you acting like you're the victim? Clearly, it was you that—

312
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,460
That was my first kiss!

313
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,400
Tang Xue.

314
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,980
You're heading back?

315
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,040
I... You're done?

316
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,930
I haven't found Coach Jin yet.

317
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,290
Then I'll head out first. You should go home soon, too.

318
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,220
Wait for me.

319
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,590
Bing-bing. Can't wait anymore, come on!

320
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,350
Hurry up and get up, you have to leave soon.

321
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,420
Bing-bing, you've been holding my hand for so long.

322
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,590
Can you let go of it now?

323
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,310
- What time is it?
- It's almost 9:00. Hurry and get up!

324
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,510
What yummy foods are you thinking about?

325
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,850
I'm not.

326
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,810
You keep pouting.

327
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,440
Get up.

328
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,640
[Dog]

329
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,690
- Hello?
- Hey, didn't you say you'd come and see me off?

330
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,220
It's so early, what time is it?

331
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,990
I didn't sleep well last night.

332
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,470
You sound sleepy. You didn't sleep well? Is it because of what happened yesterday?

333
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,750
Are you joking? That little thing?

334
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,070
Are you coming or not?

335
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,370
I, Master Tang, always do what I say I will.

336
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,110
Wait there.

337
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,440
Where are you going in such a rush, so early?

338
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,700
I have to get going. My planning competition.

339
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Bye-bye-bye! Wish me luck!

340
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,420
Good luck.

341
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,600
Remember to bring specialties back.

342
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,290
Not a problem.

343
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,450
Yubing, don't mind me nagging you.

344
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,710
This time, the one leading the national youth team is Coach Wang.

345
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,310
His capability is strong, temper is even stronger. You have to be more humble.

346
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,170
I got it, Old Xu.

347
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,670
Bing-bing, score a few more goals.

348
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,590
Make us brothers proud.

349
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,360
That's a must.

350
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,590
Take care of yourself.

351
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,700
It's not Bing-bing's first time leaving for training.

352
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,180
Don't worry about him.

353
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,900
Don't worry, I can take care of myself.

354
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,100
You didn't eat breakfast yet, right?

355
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,500
Thanks.

356
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,700
I'm leaving now.

357
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,120
You... don't have anything to say to me?

358
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,070
Have a safe trip.

359
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,680
That's it?

360
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,690
When you get there, good luck,

361
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,050
work hard...

362
00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:00,160
After you go, work hard and you'll improve.

363
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,780
More... well...

364
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,130
As long as you train diligently,

365
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,640
as long as you demonstrate your skills, the government will definitely—

366
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:20,130
anyway, you... score more goals...

367
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,510
pass more people, score more goals, that's all you need to do.

368
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,890
Okay, I got it.

369
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,320
Yubing, the car's here.

370
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,090
Okay, I'm coming right now.

371
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,820
I'm leaving. Remember while I'm gone, don't date.

372
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,380
If you do and Coach Chu finds out, you won't be able to join the short track speed skating team.

373
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,300
I know, I know. Hurry up and go.

374
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,320
- When you get there, give me a call.
- Okay, no problem.

375
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,490
That hurt so much. I'm leaving. Bye.

376
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,390
Remember to bring presents back for us.

377
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,410
- Okay.
- Be careful.

378
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,530
Bye-bye.

379
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,780
Are you going to the airport?

380
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,560
Yes, to the airport.

381
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,300
What does ice come from? Water.

382
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,440
And the biggest breakthrough point of our proposal is that we were able to invite Jam Hsiao

383
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,490
to be our spokesperson. Thank you, everyone.

384
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,330
Thank you, Contestant No.15 for his exciting presentation.

385
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,370
Next, let's welcome Contestant No.16,

386
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,560
Team Xia Yu, to present for us.

387
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,960
Hello, judges and students.

388
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,430
Our team's proposal is an "Ice Rink of Dancing."

389
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,180
[Ice Rink of Dancing]

390
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,770
We may need to turn off the lights for our presentation. Would you be able to do that for us?

391
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,330
Okay.

392
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,690
An ice rink is ice-cold; giving a person the feeling of gloominess; like winter in the north.

393
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,950
Cold and lifeless. Our design of the butterfly

394
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,970
will emerge from the cocoon in the ice rink

395
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:35,530
bringing a gorgeous, graceful splendor; giving new vitality to the ice rink.

396
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,500
Xiao Xia, you spoke so outstandingly.

397
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,170
Do you know that when we left there, the sound of the applause was still reverberating throughout the auditorium?

398
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,850
What use is that, we didn't get an award.

399
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,710
Let me correct that mistake. Even though we didn't get the first place award, we got second place.

400
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,980
Award price of ¥3,000.

401
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,740
But I just want to go to see the sloth.

402
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,900
The sloth, you will eventually see it one day. Don't be unhappy.

403
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,240
Why don't we go have a nice meal, then... then you can buy a pretty dress, some clothes...

404
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,150
So shallow! Is money supposed to be spent like that?

405
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,440
I just texted Master Tang and Old Ye, their advice was to wisely plan how to spend this money.

406
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,920
Should money be used in such a wasteful way?

407
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,710
I just want you to be happy. Anyway, I will not take any of this money for myself.

408
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,940
It's all for you to keep. Spend it on whatever makes you happy, whatever you like.

409
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,740
Did you hear that?

410
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,630
What?

411
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,530
It's a kitten!

412
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,760
- A kitten? Poor kitty. Look how skinny it is.
- Hi.

413
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,660
Let's go to the supermarket, get it some food.

414
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,270
Sure. But we can only save him for the time being, not forever.

415
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,350
It's so tiny.

416
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,390
It's almost winter. The weather will get colder.

417
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,930
It's hard to say whether it'll be able to survive the winter.

418
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,620
Right.

419
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,700
Why don't we use this ¥3,000

420
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,700
and establish a "Home for Homeless Babies"? Let's take all the little animals that don't have a place to stay for the winter to our place.

421
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,010
- To our place?
- Yeah.

422
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,780
Look. Look at our classmate, Xia Menghuan. So kind-hearted.

423
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,350
- So noble.
- I'm serious.
- Okay, okay! I was joking.

424
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,500
Later, I'll do a thorough search at LUU,

425
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,700
from the artificial lake to the rock garden. Not to mention stray animals,

426
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,880
a caterpillar or earthworm won't even be missed.

427
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,900
To realize our goal of no animals left behind without winter shelter. All right?

428
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,290
Well said. Let's do it.

429
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:16,010
But we only have ¥3000, is that enough to take care of them?

430
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,520
So many homeless animals...

431
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,380
We don't have enough but I have a method.

432
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,450
Your way of saving money is to use me as free labor.

433
00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:00,200
We spent around ¥2,700 on all the materials, we still have over ¥200 left.

434
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,830
You're not... not thinking about adding two more, right?

435
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,660
It's enough. I'll buy you a nice dinner with what's left.

436
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,350
Stop talking about food. I care more than that.

437
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:16,930
But I think there is a new restaurant behind our school, I heard it's not bad.

438
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,650
Then let's go there. You don't need to make excuses.

439
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,470
Go change into the uniform in the changing room, and then wait in the training room.

440
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,120
Li Yubing, center forward position.

441
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,460
79.4 kg, you are a bit light for the center forward.

442
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,560
Wayne Gretzky was also this weight when he was 18.

443
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,180
Go get changed.

444
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:49,080
Cai Lei, winger position, 87.5kg.

445
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,920
90.7 kg.

446
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
Same as Sidney Crosby.

447
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,930
Go get changed.

448
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,700
Did you see Song Anjie?

449
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,820
It's his second time on the team.

450
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,410
Coach Wang coached him personally. He just returned from abroad.

451
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,590
But this year, we have an Ice God, Li Yubing, who also plays center forward.

452
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,170
There will be a fierce battle.

453
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,790
What battle? We are on the same team.

454
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,860
- Hi, Brother Jie.
- Brother Jie.

455
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,460
Fall in! In two lines.

456
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,750
I don't care how many years you've played hockey, don't care if you've been under me before,

457
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,170
don't care if you've been in the national youth team before.

458
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,620
Starting today, you are all newbies.

459
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,250
Today is your first day of practice. Why don't you all introduce yourselves?

460
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,760
Cai Lei, age 19, Harbin Bears, winger position.

461
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,830
Song Anjie, age 20, Harbin Bears, center forward.

462
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,110
Li Yubing, age 18, LUU XDragons, center forward position.

463
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,600
Jia Chuanzhi, age 18, Hohhot Qilin, forward position.

464
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,940
Zhe Yefan, age 19, Hohhot Tigers, defender position.

465
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,420
Zhang Cheng, age 20, Qingcheng Warriors, defender position.
