159
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,220
and yet you wanted her to deliver a package?

160
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,950
You're quite creative.

161
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,740
Tang Xue had a fever from yesterday night until now.

162
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,540
- What?
- I'm telling you, Li Yubing!

163
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,550
If something happens to Master Tang, I'll never let you off!

164
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,650
Also,

165
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,560
it's almost Hawkeye's class again.

166
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,470
If she fails this class, you'll have to be fully responsible.

167
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,720
Who's Hawkeye?

168
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,590
Bro, do you even attend this university?

169
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,010
Hawkeye is well-known as the devil of all teachers in LUU.

170
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,860
No one can be late or ditch.

171
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,340
Because of her stupid training with you, she's already been late three times.

172
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,710
If she skips class once more, she won't be able to take the exams, you know that?

173
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,090
Hello? Hello?

174
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,150
Let's start class.

175
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,270
To save time, I'm just going to spot-check your attendance today.

176
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,300
- I'll only call ten names.
- Yes!

177
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,860
Please don't chose Tang Xue.

178
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,820
- Zhu Ziang?
- Here!

179
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,810
- Fei Ming?
- Here!

180
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,870
- Hao Tenglei.
- Here!

181
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,530
- Hu Lele.
- Here.

182
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,950
- Yao Yiping.
- Here.

183
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,200
Xia Menghuan.

184
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,360
Xia Menghuan.

185
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,460
Here!

186
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,540
It's the last one.

187
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,220
Tang Xue.

188
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,610
Did Tang Xue come?

189
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,160
Here.

190
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,100
Okay.

191
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,560
Classmates, please open your book to page 58.

192
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,450
Master Tang, while your fever wouldn't let up these last couple days, you almost scared me to death.

193
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,670
Come and take it.

194
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,590
Thankfully, Xiao Liao brings you food every day.

195
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,780
Thank you.

196
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,440
I brought it for both of you.

197
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,730
When will I get away from that dog's evil claws?

198
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,630
But it's really odd. These last couple days, he's answered for you in role call.

199
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,670
He's really something.

200
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,590
There is also deep research into the area of protecting vets from infectious diseases.

201
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,700
Especially zoonosis.

202
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,080
Yet, clinical vets mainly deal with treating acute illnesses in big and small animals.

203
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,090
Based on his personality, that's called "calm before the storm."

204
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,030
The big tricks are later.

205
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,680
You know what? When he was in our veterinary class,

206
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,880
the celebrated Ice God

207
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,970
changed from sitting upright to someone without any vertebrae. In the end, he was like one of those soft-bodied animals.

208
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,360
- Just imagining what it looked like is already so funny.
- Get away.

209
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,050
I think you should think of a way to pay his money back.

210
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,820
That way, you won't have to bother with all this.

211
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,470
Obviously, I want to pay it all back. I want to do it this afternoon.

212
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,470
This afternoon, come with me... to sell blood.

213
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,220
Yu Yan.

214
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,220
What's up? So mysterious.

215
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,760
You're here.

216
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,320
Didn't you say last time that you owe Li Yubing money?

217
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,730
What?

218
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,030
How did you get this much money?

219
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,660
Don't worry about it. Go pay Li Yubing back.

220
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,480
I can't take this money. Did you do something illegal?

221
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,340
Look at you. Why would I do that?

222
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,840
Then did you sell your blood, or—

223
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,930
Anyway, how did you, such a poor college student get so much money?

224
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,880
I'm not a poor college student.

225
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,560
You're not? Then, why do you eat so little and never spend money?

226
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,360
I'm just trying to maintain my figure.

227
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,920
I eat according to my mom's strict rules.

228
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,600
Especially when I'm close to a competition, I can't eat those good-tasting things.

229
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,450
How could there be a figure skater who's fat?

230
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,510
Then, why don't you even have a smartphone?

231
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,670
I'm just worried I'll be distracted. It might affect my training and sleep.

232
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,340
You're not lying to me?

233
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,330
Are you sure you're not lying to me just to help me out?

234
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,940
Of course not. I never wanted to keep it from you.

235
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,170
It's just, every time I try to tell you, you interrupt and say other things.

236
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm not lacking money. This is a portion of my prize money, so just take it.

237
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,260
I can't accept this money, but I appreciate the thought.

238
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,900
You're terrific, Yu Yan.

239
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,690
Tang Xue,

240
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,070
are you more willing to owe money to me

241
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,070
or to Li Yubing?

242
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,690
Fine. Let's say I'm borrowing it.

243
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,510
I'll pay the interest. I'll work a couple of jobs and pay you back.

244
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,030
Don't do part-time jobs.

245
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,510
I don't need this money right away.

246
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,990
Just don't be Li Yubing's assistant anymore.

247
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,580
I have a class now. I'm leaving.

248
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,000
Not a poor college student?

249
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,360
- You bought it?
- Yeah. Oh right.

250
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,750
I'll pay you the money back after a while.

251
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,870
You sound like you always pay me back or something.

252
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,600
I owe you.

253
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,570
I heard you've been going to veterinary classes recently

254
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,230
and studying veterinary medicine. What are you doing?

255
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,350
You're even asking him? For ¥50,000 a month, taking some classes isn't much.

256
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,330
Brilliant.

257
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,360
Bing-bing, when she pays you money,

258
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,980
does she use Wechat or Alipay?

259
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,690
Or does she directly give it to you with a card?

260
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,270
Li Yubing, here's the money.

261
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,430
- Are you feeling better?
- It's rare for you to know I was sick.

262
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,470
But that night, it was raining.

263
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,760
You tortured me all night. Why didn't you think about me at that time?

264
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,300
Isn't what she's talking about too private?

265
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,100
Don't speak nonsense. It's not what you think.

266
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,410
It's exactly ¥40,000.

267
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,260
We don't owe each other anything now.

268
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,840
Tang Xue.

269
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,860
Take this, I don't need it.

270
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,630
Do you want to continue to torture me?

271
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,240
Bing-bing, last month was ¥50,000,

272
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,340
this month is ¥40,000. Did you do something wrong?

273
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,010
The second month is discounted at 20%.

274
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,440
- So, you returned all of his money?
- Yes.

275
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,600
Right now, the air is filled with freshness and cleanliness.

276
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,060
How are you going to pay back Yu Yan's money?

277
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,900
I'll slowly pay him back.

278
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,380
I'll just try to save some from my living expenses.

279
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,710
If not, then I'll do some part-time jobs and be able to pay him back.

280
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,010
Anyway, I'm out of Li Yubing's evil claws.

281
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,300
So happy.

282
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,940
Hey, Master Yang. Tonight the club activity center

283
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,210
has organized a freshmen friendship get together.

284
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,230
I heard it's the most magnificent, exciting party of the year.

285
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,800
So, do you want to go together?

286
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,750
I won't go.

287
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,840
Being his assistant took up a lot of my time.

288
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,670
Now I have to diligently study.

289
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,160
Then that's too bad. All the fruit and cake...

290
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,440
There's a cake?

291
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,730
There will also be steak, chicken wings, salad, fried chicken, all of your favorites.

292
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,910
You know every day we deal with animals, which isn't too interesting.

293
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,300
Occasionally attending a friendship get together isn't a bad thing.

294
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,790
Then, does that mean you'll go?

295
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,120
Right now, I am eating dirt.
(T/N: slang: she's dirt poor)

296
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,600
As someone who has negative equity, having to pay for such an expensive entrance fee, I...

297
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,720
- It's free.
- Let's go.

298
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,530
Wait! Wait!

299
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,670
Let Teacher Xiao Xia make you look amazing.

300
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,020
Sister Huan, I think this dress is too small.

301
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,590
Wow. It looks great. It's supposed to be small so you can look skinny.

302
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,870
A... A... AB... AN... Abandon.

303
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,210
Are we bothering her studies?

304
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,110
Xiao Ye, you've repeated those letters for over an hour. You're clearly dying to do something else.

305
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,670
Come with us.

306
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,430
Forget it. In a little while, I have to tutor level four. I won't go.

307
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:10,640
Didn't that Hamlet say, "To be or not to be, that is the question?"

308
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,670
So, this level four and friendship get together aren't a problem.

309
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,460
- Let's go. Go. Go.
- Put some makeup on.

310
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,150
Brother Bing...

311
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,990
Brother Bing, here's the toilet paper.

312
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,330
Old Deng, how many times have I told you? I said I don't want to go, so I'm not going. Do you not understand that?

313
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,310
No... Brother Bing. Uh...

314
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,560
Today is the freshmen friendship get together.

315
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,190
There will be lots of pretty girls.

316
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,240
What does the freshmen get together have to do with the two of us?

317
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,290
You're the Ice God.

318
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,500
You can get in but I can't.

319
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,860
Li Yubing! Stop right there!

320
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,610
Ice God should behave like an Ice God!

321
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,770
Clothing...

322
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,110
shouldn't be washed by yourself.

323
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,280
Where have you put your roommates?

324
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,630
Are there any others?

325
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,720
Under the pillow.

326
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,520
Leave these for Old Jiang.

327
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,280
If this matter comes up again, tell me!

328
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,120
I heard a lot of handsome guys will be coming.

329
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,230
Handsome guys?

330
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,960
Would genuine top-quality young men really come to

331
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,370
this kind of superficial place?

332
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,330
Maybe writers of romances or something like that.

333
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,110
I'll just continue reading.

334
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,740
Don't look around anymore. I've already scanned the room. There isn't anyone. We've been lied to.

335
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,130
- I found it.
- Where? Where?

336
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,900
Slow down. Don't rip the dress.

337
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,050
We're already here. Cheer up.

338
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,070
I'm warning you. If you still want to be my friend, this is the last time.

339
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,440
Okay. Last time.

340
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,680
Do a toast with me.

341
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,110
Why are you leaning in so close?

342
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,990
There are two junior girls looking at me.

343
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,830
Toast me again.

344
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,910
Don't use my name to swindle, cheat, and deceive people. Okay?

345
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,810
It's not as serious as what you're saying.

346
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,450
I'm just deceiving, not swindling or cheating.

347
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,430
Okay, fine. Great.

348
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,180
Look. Goddess.

349
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,330
Ice God, we meet again.

350
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,020
Hi.

351
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,670
No wonder you're Ice God.

352
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,850
I've brought you a month of breakfast. You are still like a piece of ice, never melted.

353
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,420
I melted.

354
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,160
Thank you, but Tang Xue is about to quit,

355
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,730
so you don't need to send me breakfast anymore.

356
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,740
Actually, it's on the way for me.

357
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,430
Right... on the way.

358
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,800
You're really too polite. There's no need.

359
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,590
Right, my mom just sent me some imported desserts.

360
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,110
If you like to eat them, I can bring them to you tomorrow for breakfast.

361
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,880
No, it's fine.

362
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,490
That's a waste. It's fine.

363
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm going to go to the restroom.

364
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,860
Ice God.

365
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,510
Junior, I'm Deng Jianguo. I'm the goalkeeper for the ice hockey team.

366
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,660
I also have another identity...

367
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,950
I'm Ice God's roommate.

368
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,170
Beautiful girl, what's your name?

369
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,950
My name is Zhou Ran. I'm in the broadcasting department.

370
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,060
When you speak, it's like the sounds of nature.

371
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,140
Senior, you flatter me. You're worthy of being the hockey team's goalkeeper.

372
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,530
You have a great... stature.

373
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,970
Understanding your own significance.

374
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,690
If one fully understands their own ability, then their ability output

375
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,410
will have very high efficiency.

376
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,530
This person clearly does not understand himself. His efficiency is way too low.

377
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,760
Don't tell me that what you saw were these.

378
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,900
Don't you want to eat?

379
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,620
It took me so long to get you ready, was it just for you to come and eat?

380
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,540
Hi, classmate.

381
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,700
Let me introduce myself. I'm a newly admitted master's student studying in bio-medicine. How about you?

382
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,290
I'm a veterinary medicine major.

383
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,350
Veterinary.

384
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,730
Oh, I didn't expect that our majors would be so similar!

385
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,950
This is fate.

386
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,970
In the future, we can share our academic findings with each other.

387
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,260
Yeah, sure!

388
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:25,380
If I can be so bold in this setting, I don't know whether I should say something.

389
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,900
Move aside.

390
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,120
I'm wondering,

391
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,340
who gave you that courage?

392
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,920
So unbridled in front of a veterinarian, did you get a number?

393
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,580
Excuse me, but who are you?

394
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,570
Who am I? Let me tell you.

395
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,960
This girl beside me is already taken.

396
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,170
She already has someone.

397
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,300
Sorry, it's a misunderstanding. I'm sorry, I didn't know.

398
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,200
Come over here with me.

399
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,500
I don't blame you for what was just said.

400
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,870
We're keeping our relationship on the down-low.

401
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,960
Oh... sorry about that, bro.

402
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,870
I'll go socialize over there.

403
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,550
Continue.

404
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,530
Also, keep an eye on your girlfriend.

405
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,350
What are you doing at a party if you already have a partner?

406
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,400
That's not true.

407
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,230
Do you want to die? What are you doing here?

408
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,820
If you're here, then why can't I come?

409
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,530
What nonsense were you talking about? Who are you saying that they're already taken?

410
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,780
I'm doing this for your sake. Look at how he looks.

411
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,700
Pretending to be dignified, dressing himself up. At first glance...

412
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,080
Look, look, look. He's trying to pick someone else up.

413
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,250
I'm telling you! We guys can tell straight away if a guy is good or not.

414
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,890
Stop talking about me for a second, what are you doing here?

415
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,360
To make friends!

416
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,900
Why do you need to make friends? You already have best friends,

417
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,300
If you want a boy, you have me. Aren't you satisfied?

418
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,050
A person's biggest weakness is being greedy.

419
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,020
Come with me. I'll teach you a lesson.

420
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,630
I have to educate you.

421
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,540
Junior, listen to me. Last time at the away game,

422
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,620
if it weren't for the build of my body, the other team would've scored a goal.

423
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,190
Senior, I must leave for a little bit.

424
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,190
Junior, we still haven't exchanged Wechat contacts yet!

425
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,610
Cousin! (T/N: younger female cousin)

426
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,790
I heard that Li Yubing fired you.

427
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,650
I was the one who resigned, okay?

428
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,970
Quit bluffing.

429
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,990
Your outfit is quite unique today. I bet you spent a long time dressing up.

430
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:59,200
You are allowed to doll up. I can be pretty, too.

431
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,030
It's not your style. Where did you borrow it?

432
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,330
Leave me alone. Mind your own business.

433
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,500
You look like a feather duster.

434
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,370
You can't appreciate it.

435
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,600
It's the latest style from this year's Milan fashion week.

436
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,530
- I'll get you a vacuum tomorrow. Bye for now.
- Wait!

437
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,550
I haven't finished talking.

438
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,340
What happened? Someone flashed themselves!

439
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,600
Tang Xue, sorry I didn't mean to do that.

440
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,380
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right. You should go and ask Tang Xue.

441
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,170
Move over.

442
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,290
♫ I don’t know how to say the words in my heart ♫

443
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,880
♫ I see you but the nervous one is me ♫

444
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,420
♫ The sweat in the palm of my hand accidentally falls ♫

445
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,320
Oh my gosh, that's my idol.

446
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,980
Are you okay?

447
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,380
Are you?

448
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,080
Why are you dressed so feminine today?

449
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,620
This is my style.

450
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,630
♫ Don’t want to say much more ♫

451
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:35,590
♫ I just want to embrace you in this moment ♫

452
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,360
What happened to you? Did you get in an accident?

453
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,260
Are you okay, Master Tang?

454
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,790
What did I say again?

455
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,310
There are more predators than prey at this get together. Something will definitely go wrong.

456
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,360
That's the reason you dragged me outside?

457
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,460
No, I wanted to...

458
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,410
take you to see the night sky.

459
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,170
I didn't notice that

460
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,270
Li Yubing is pretty good to you.

461
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,300
Yeah, pretty good.

462
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,970
What I didn't finish earlier is to tell you

463
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,120
Bian Cheng is coming to LUU.

464
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,660
Bian Cheng?

465
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,510
You guys haven't seen each other in a long time, right?

466
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,550
Are you okay?

467
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,790
Hey, Junior... We haven't exchanged Wechat, Junior!

468
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,220
Let's go back first.

469
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,300
Let's go.

470
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,990
Junior sister!

471
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,420
Sorry about that.

472
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,700

You have no character!

475

I have no character? You bumped into me while walking and you say that I have no character?

476
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,780
Next time, pay attention when you walk!

477
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,260
You are unreasonable.

478

Senior, what do you need?

484
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:25,050
Nothing. Can I have your WeChat?

485
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,340
All right, I usually pay quite a bit of attention to the hockey team as well.

Please take good care of me when you have time, Senior.

Not only are you very pretty, but your personality is also very straightforward.

488

I'm flattered. I'll treat you to a meal some time.

No need. You've treated us to breakfast for a whole month already.

He obviously shares good things with his brothers.

Junior, remember to accept my friend request.

497

My name is Deng Jianguo.

498
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,060
There's nothing wrong with me, right?

499
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,010
Why did I protect her in front of a crowd?

500
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,120
Did I... fall for her?

501
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,160
There's no way!
