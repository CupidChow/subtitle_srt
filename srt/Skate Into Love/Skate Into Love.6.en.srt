00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Based on the club's opinion and my personal observations,

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,400
we unanimously agree that you have the qualities to become a professional training buddy.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Li Yubing, are you determined to mess with me?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,800
Whatever you say.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Anyway, you're bound to the contract with the club.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Your job is to support me.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Whatever I plan, that's what you have to do.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Fine, one month.

Let's begin.

Who knew that this girl could keep up with my physical training.

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
This would indicate

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,000
that she really has potential.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Tang Xue, keep it up!

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,900
You'll be able to be freed from this devil soon.

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,300
Hurry up, Autobot! A tractor is even faster than you.

33
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,000
I have a whole bag of sandbags on me.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
And you didn't even say anything about helping me!

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't care. That's the trouble you got yourself into.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Hurry up!

37
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,730
Tang Xue.

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
You're doing pretty good. I didn't even summon you and yet you came.

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Pretty good. You improved a lot.

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,200
After all, today is not like any other day.

41

I'm here today to give you a friendly reminder.

42

I won't be able to serve you any longer after today.

Ah, that's right.

Today is a special day.

I've prepared a gift for you as a token of remembrance.

47

Gift?

48
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,950
Please accept this.

Thank you for your gift.

It's very extraordinary. But who knows what special occasion it is today.

51

- Manager Ma.
- Oh, it's you, Tang Xue.

Come here and sit down.

55
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,000
What's the matter?

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Today is the day where I've been at work for an entire month.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,700
I've already notified Li Yubing

58
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,900
that I probably won't be able to continue to work any longer.

59
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,000
So I'm here to collect my pay.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're here for this.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know, I know.

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
This is your paystub for this month.

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,800
A total of ¥2,450. Take a look and see

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,900
if there's any problem.

65
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
No problems.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,400
But Li Yubing owed me ¥7,000 as an extra service fee in the past. I don't know if he told you yet.

67
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I know that, too. Here in this last column.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,800
So adding them up together will give you a total of ¥9,450.

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,900
Do you have any issues?

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
No issues at all.

71
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,300
Everyone is familiar with each other already, so I'll just round it to the nearest zero, ¥9,400 will do.

72
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,400
Manager Ma, WeChat Pay, Alipay, or cash. What is the most convenient for you?

73

74
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,900
I'm fine with any, too.

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,900
Okay. But let's not rush first, okay?

77
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Besides all this though, you still have to pay a ¥50,000 penalty for this month.

78
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,000
Subtracting from that portion earlier, you still have ¥40,550 left to pay.

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,800
But see, we are both familiar with each other already, so I'll just round it to the nearest zero.

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Giving me ¥40,000 will do.

Tang Xue, within just 30 days of your employment,

85
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,500
you illegally sold the privacy of one of my club's athletes 29 times.

You could be said as breaking the highest record of our club.

Ice God, Li Yubing's privacy was sold every morning by you.

91

His privacy was therefore strongly disturbed for an entire month,

92
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,200
making him emotionally distressed, mentally distracted,

It's not like I want to scold you. But if you have difficulties, then you could tell the club.

102
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,000
The club would most definitely try to help you out.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,600
But now that you accept money from others, then the nature of this case is different.

104
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,200
It is a disclosure of privacy with the purpose of profit.

105
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,600
And do you know, because you sold his privacy,

Perhaps you could only just ride a donkey back home.

I'm sure this isn't a situation you'd want to see either.

What else do you have to say?

is only something a dog like Li Yubing would say?

143
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,570
You want me to lend you money, right?

144
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,040
You get me.

146
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,010
Recently a new game console came out, but my hands are tight.

Okay, I get it.

Here is ¥400. Take it to squander.

Who would believe you're this poor?

150
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,970
- If you don't want it, then don't take it.
- No, no, no.

151
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,460
¥400 is ¥400. I'll try to get some more another way.

Tell me. Are you two together?

157
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,370
What relationship would we have? She's just my assistant and trains with me every day.

158
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,780
Training? Assistant?

159
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,350
Have you fallen for her?

160
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,320
Fallen for her?

161
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,380
Then tell us. You two are always together.

162
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,070
Don't tell me you don't have any feelings?

163
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,290
Can you guys cut it out? Move aside.

164
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,380
Li Yubing!

165
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,400
Hey!

166
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,870
Are you a man? Can't you take some responsibility?

167
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,690
Tang Xue, can't you have some basic decency? How can you just barge into the men's locker room?

168
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,540
Li Yubing, let me tell you. You are a swindler!

169
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,430
- Bing-bing, tell the truth, did you cheat this girl's feelings?
- What are you talking about?

170
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,390
Listen up, all.

171
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,330
Li Yubing did cheat my feelings!

172
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,640
Wow! What did I say?

173
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,040
Tang Xue, can't you watch your words and the effect they bring?

174
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,880
A person like you can also talk about being effected?

175
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,400
We agreed on one month. Why aren't you letting me go after the time is up?

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,760
This is such breaking news. Booked for a month? No wonder I was thinking why you were so poor lately.

177
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,980
If you're poor, then just say so! Why would you come to me to ask for money?

178
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,740
Oh, I'm sorry. It's the other way around. 
(T/N: Implying that he thought it was Li Yubing who was a sugar daddy.)

179
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,960
And the amount you demand is ¥50,000.

180
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,080
You're pretty good, huh? Why don't you just rob a bank?

181
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,070
How much? ¥50,000? Bing-bing,

182
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,360
your price is pretty high.

183
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,060
Shut up! Hurry up and go take a shower! What are you doing here?

184
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,520
Let's go, let's go. Take a shower. Take a shower.

185
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,060
If the payment is not given yet, the feelings are still there.

186
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,890
Get lost!

187
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,540
One month for ¥50,000.

188
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,600
Pretty good.

189
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,380
Tang Xue, can't you stop misbehaving?

190
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,610
Manager Ma should have already told you what I wanted to say and what I should say.

191
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,280
So both of you partnered up in setting me up.

192
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,720
You violated my privacy and you said I'm setting you up?

193
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,150
Tang Xue, you're a college student. Can you be more rational?

194
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,620
How can I be rational when talking to someone like you?

195
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,620
Okay, either pay the money back or work until you pay it back. Choose one.

196
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,850
No way. I won't choose either.

197
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,230
Is that so? Then I can only use the law to protect myself.

198
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,850
Remember to bring me breakfast tomorrow morning.

199
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,190
Why are you still here? I have to change.

200
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,460
You're not leaving?

201
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,830
Dad, how have you been recently? How's your health?

202
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,890
Good, good. Do you need money again?

203
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,310
Dad, am I that kind of person? You can't think of me like that.

204
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,380
After we hang up, I'll send you my bank account number.

205
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,350
A father knows his daughter the best.

206
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,080
Daughter,

207
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,850
the month just started and you ran out of money already?

208
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,370
That's not it. Since the semester just started, I want to buy some things.

209
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,710
Okay, sure! What do you want to buy?

210
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,260
Clothes, shoes, bags, makeup.

211
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,620
Okay, I'll send you ¥1,000 ($141 USD).

212
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,670
Dad, the semester just started, and for my elective I chose astronomy.

213
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,680
I need to buy a telescope.

214
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,360
You're a veterinary medicine student, why would you buy a telescope?

215
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,020
Is there Peppa the pig in the sky to look at?

216
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,300
Can't I have some hobbies?

217
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,660
Okay, I'll support your hobby.

218
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,320
I'll send you ¥10,000 ($1,410.04 USD)

219
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,040
Dad, also, I think recently my body has been feeling kind of weak.

220
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,130
I don't feel well a lot of the time, so I want to buy some health supplements.

221
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,920
Like red date xanthophyll gelatin, bird's nest with brown sugar.

222
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,240
Right?

223
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,280
Daughter, is everything okay?

224
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,500
Yeah, everything's fine; no problems.

225
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,850
Don't hide it from me. I've seen a lot of things happen in life.

226
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,450
Tell me. What's really going on?

227
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,310
Dad, you're overthinking it. There's really nothing going on.

228
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Okay, Dad misunderstood you.

229
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Tell me. How much money do you want?

230
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,620
I think ¥40,000 should be enough. ($5,640.16 USD)

231
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,860
How much?

232
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,400
¥40,000.

233
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,720
Okay, Dad misunderstood you.

234
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,920
With that amount,

235
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,760
you must want to keep this child.

236
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,820
Dad, what are you thinking?!

237
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,630
Calm down? You have to be calm.

238
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,300
I and your mom will get on the next train out to see you.

239
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,170
Your parents will be with you for this kind of thing.

240
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,350
Even if the sky falls, we'll be here for you.

241
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,540
In this situation, you...

242
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,220
Your mom's here, I'll let your mom talk to you about this.

243
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,450
First, it's not what you're thinking at all. You're really overthinking this.

244
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,650
Second, everything's going well at school; nothing's happened.

245
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Nevermind. Forget it. Just pretend like nothing happened, okay?

246
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,700
That's all. I'm busy now. Bye-bye.

247
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,830
What's this situation? She asked for money!

248
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,210
If she asked for money then you can just transfer it to her.

249
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,570
She wanted ¥40,000!

250
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,590
- How much?
- ¥40,000!

251
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,990
¥40,000?!

252
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,260
What's going on? Do you think something happened to her?

253
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,480
Let's not talk about it anymore. I think we should just go to Lincheng.

254
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,870
What are you talking about, going to Lincheng? Do you not know your child at all?

255
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,460
Of course, I do.

256
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,730
Okay, then there are no issues. Hurry up and go to the supermarket; eggs are on sale.

257
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,290
Don't rub it. Quickly, buy some eggs.

258
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,310
This girl lied to me again!

259
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,050
Hurry!

260
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,810
One day, I will pay him back in double.

No, I came to get something.

I'm getting ready to go to class now.

It's this time already?

269
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,350
I've already missed so many of Hawkeye's classes this semester because of Li Yubing.

270
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,220
If I'm late again, I won't be able to do my exams.

No, it's okay! Forget about him.

By the way, thanks for your encouragement last time.

274

Don't worry about it. You also encourage me a lot.

275

Of course! It's your birthday?

279

You're aware, too, I don't have many friends. I just have you as a friend.

280
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,600
Can you celebrate my birthday with me?

281
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,730
No problem!

282
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,840
Where do you want to go?

283
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,440
To go to an aquarium.

Why?

285
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,710
I never got to go when I was a child. So after growing up, I really want to go.

286
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,030
I'll tell you tomorrow.

See you tomorrow!

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,300
Where are you going? Did you finish polishing the helmets?

290
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,010
There are so many helmets, how could I finish polishing all of them?

291
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,430
A fast move is the best surprise.

Hey, Xiao Liao.

318
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,790
In our dorm, you're the only one without a girlfriend.

319
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,970
Neither does Fatty.

320
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,390
Bullshit. I got one last week, okay?

321
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,080
You dared to say that?

322
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,640
You've never even met once. You've only been chatting through virtual messages in a bottle.

323
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,190
You're not embarrassed to claim she's your girlfriend?

324
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,670
You're wrong. They are already married in the game.

325
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,970
Yeah. I've gifted her several castles.

326
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,470
- Wow.
- You clearly envy me.

327
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,630
Me? Envy you?

328

How are you not ashamed to say that?

329

Okay, okay.

330

How's it going with you and that girl from the veterinary medicine department?

331

Come here, come here.

Right now, she's already interested in me.

334
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,000
Before long, she'll have completely fallen for me.

335

Let me tell you!

336
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,600
At most in two weeks, she'll have fallen for me.

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
Are you being serious?

338
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,200
You wouldn't understand. You'll be basically widowed

once the router is disconnected.

Xiao Xiao, you-you're done with class so early?

Earlier, even from far away I could hear someone bragging. It was quite annoying.

348
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,500
Who did you say was going to fall for you?

349
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,000
Ah, what?

350
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,400
Speaking of the devil.

Nothing.

Hey, where's Master Tang? She didn't leave class with you?

354
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,400
She said she had to do some public service today, so she didn't even go to class and just left.

355
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,100

Master Tang is really too kind. Thank you, Master Tang!

So we don't let down Master Tang's spirit in Heaven.

We can't let down Master Tang's good intentions.

What's the reason?

367
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,200
The reason? To make our friendship closer.

Let's not eat at the cafeteria today. Let's go eat something good out.

What are you going to treat me to?

I'll take you to eat French food. How's that?

- Seems not bad.
- Right?

- Yes, let's go!

375
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Huan-huan, French foie gras (goose liver) is super yummy. I used to go all the time and get a couple of skewers of them.

376
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,600
Bro, foie gras is eaten on skewers? Are you talking about chicken gizzards?

377

Foie gras and red wine together is really delicious food.

That works, too.

You're afraid of spending the money? Fine, I'm not going.

No, no, no! It's definitely not that.

Is it some kind of Western Asian fusion?

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,900
I think you've misunderstood. I'm not—

474
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,600
I get it. You don't need to explain.

475
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,300
The smartphone I gave you last time, are you getting used to the functions?

476
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
I have it right here.

477
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,600
It's so new.

478
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,300
It's newer than when I gave it to you. Do you refurbish phones on the side?

479
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,800
Your screen is still so empty.

480
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I don't really know how to use it, and it seems too precious to use.

481
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,400
Then, what's the point of me giving it to you?

482
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll show you. You can download this app if you want to be kept up to date at LUU.

483
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,600
This is especially for the LUU campus.

484
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,500
You can do a lot of things with this app. Look.

485
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
You can order takeout,

486
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,100
add money to your student card, look up your class schedule,

487
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,500
buy and sell secondhand things,

488
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,700
with no middleman fee!

489
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,100
Look.

490
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,000
The main point is you can stay up-to-date on any hot topics in our school,

491
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,700
or any recent news.

492
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
Is... that you?

493
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,500
It's not what you're thinking!

494
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,800
Don't think too much of it. It's really not.

495
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,700
I don't know who wrote this kind of article.

496
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,700
Tang Xue, you and Li Yubing... what kind of relationship do you guys have?

497
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,000
We don't have any kind of relationship.

498
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,300
It's okay.

499
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
Exactly. We don't have anything to do with each other.

500
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,200
I mean, it's okay.

501
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,000
You can tell me, I won't tell anyone.

502
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm telling you...

503
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,180
This is

504
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,600
a very tragic and sad story.

505
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,290
It's been a long time since we played basketball, especially three against three.

506
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,660
Those outside our school look down on us.

507
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,330
They thought Wei-wei was our weak point. But look, they were abused by her.

508
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,730
I'm telling you! Wei-wei is as good as three players combined. Pure ma...

509
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,760
Magnificent!

510
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,040
Kiss-ass.

511
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,500
You are talking. You are a bad forward. Such a horrible shooter.

512
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,410
I admit I can't make a basket.

513
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,030
Didn't I get all the rebounds?

514
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:43,610
Yes, yes. You are a redhead away from the rebound king.

515
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,740
I'm telling you, I'm a genius.

516
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,000
If I was not devoted to hockey,

517
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,940
I'd be an excellent center forward.

518
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,150
Arrogant.

519
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,040
I pity the basketball industry.

520
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,190
Let's go eat something. I'm hungry.

521
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,210
We're tired after playing for a whole afternoon.

522
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,460
I'll ask Tang Xue to send over some food.

523
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,330
Tang Xue?

524
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,490
Tang Xue. Bing-bing's assistant.

525
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,230
She lost to you in speed skating that last time.

526
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:19,130
I know her. She's got some foundations, but still not solid enough.

527
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,320
What's the matter? Not in the service region?

528
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,800
She's probably hiding from you again.

529
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,860
I'm telling you, Wei-wei. His assistant has an attitude.

530
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,090
And she's always on the side of Yu Yan, the figure skater.

531
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,320
I really don't understand whose assistant she is.

532
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,700
Enough! Don't just keep on calling. Let's go to our usual spot.

533
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,300
Let's go.

534
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,070
Let's go.

535
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,020
I'm not going. You guys go.

536
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,890
I need to pick up a package in a bit. You guys go ahead.

537
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,840
Package? We'll just help you grab it on the way. Don't skip dinner!

538
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,620
Right, Bing-bing. Why aren't you eating?

539
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,480
Are you angry at Tang Xue again?

540
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,370
No way. Go ahead. I can take care of it.

541
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,990
Take care of what? Let's have dinner after playing all afternoon. How long are you going to wait for?

542
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,250
Wei-wei, he has been on a diet recently. Let's leave him if he doesn't want to eat.

543
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,690
Let's go! Come on.

544
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,210
We're leaving, Bing-bing. Bye.

545
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,440
What? Pay a fine? And you have to put in ¥40,000?

546
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,790
Don't you agree that he's a dog?
(T/N: he's pathetic, a son of a bitch)

547
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,870
How do we poor students get the money?

548
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:42,470
So I have to work there and slowly pay him off.

549
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:47,940
Tang Xue, if you want, I can help you raise money.

550
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,770
He's a poor student that can't even afford a second-hand cellphone,

551
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,310
yet he can say these words.

552
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,510
It's quite touching.

553
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,960
- Thanks, but I can handle it.
- You?

554
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,380
- Does anyone want to interact with the dolphins?
- Here! Here!

Come, come. Enter through here. Here, here.

Almost there.

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,820
Xiao Xia, what restaurant did you take me to? Why is it so quiet?

561
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,140
This is a private place.

562
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,800
- We're here. Stop.
- Here?

I'm lighting up a candle. There will be a better atmosphere this way.

- Why is there no smell?
- Hey! Don't take it off.

If you take it off, I'll delete you from WeChat.

- I won't take it off.
- Touch it.

Try and touch it.

That won't be that good, right?

Wait a minute. There's a second dish. Wait!

The second dish is here.

00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,180
Tada.

583
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,220
I guess that the second dish must be foie gras, right?

584
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,460
Correct!

♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

629
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,760
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

630
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,600
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

631
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:27,160
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

632
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,540
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

633
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:40,110
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

634
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:46,470
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

635
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:52,520
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

636
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:00,030
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

637
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:06,530
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

638
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:12,590
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

639
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:18,630
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

640
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:25,740
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

641
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,840
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

642
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:39,450
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

643
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:45,620
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream, (only you can understand) ♫

644
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:52,880
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

645
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,410
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

646
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,270
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

647
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:07,070
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
