[Episode 16]

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,760
Hey. Is that the North Star?

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,440
I still remember someone telling me that's the direction towards home.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,060
- You still remember?
- Of course.

21
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,650
That year, I wanted to be like a swordsman from the martial arts movies

22
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,260
and travel the four corners of the world.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,310
But I had to have you to drag me down.

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,290
You were the one who dragged me.

25
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,420
Oh no, we lost the money and we're lost.

26
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,280
We can't go home now.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,630
Don't worry. I'll definitely get you home.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,830
- I... I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,470
Little kids, why are you crying? Is it because you're hungry?

30
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,130
Auntie will give you two pancakes.

31
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,290
- Thank you, Auntie.
- No problem. Here you go.

32
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,440
- Here's yours.
- Thank you, Auntie.

33
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,870
- Are the two of you related?
- No, we're not.

34
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,220
From the looks of it, when you guys get older, you'll become a family.

35
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,060
- We will.
- We won't.

36
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,050
We will.

37
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,080
Honestly, that pancake was the best pancake I'd ever had.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,100
It was really good. It's a shame it was stolen by a stray dog on the way home.

39
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,250
That was all your fault. If I weren't trying to protect you, I could've sent that dog running.

40
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,940
Is that so? I clearly remember someone was also so scared they couldn't move.

41
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,660
Although I did learn about the North Star from you,

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,950
the trip wasn't for nothing.

43
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,910
So what if you can find the North Star? You still couldn't find the way home.

44
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,200
I guess I should study geography instead of astronomy.

45
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,830
Make some small mistakes in moderation.

46
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,820
It will grab their attention more easily and increase interpersonal appeal. This is called the Pratfall effect.

47
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,070
Excuse me. Do you have anything I can use as a blanket or wrap?

48
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,330
I do, I do.

49
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,160
Young man, good luck!

50
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,810
Thank you.

51
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,770
Dog, this overcoat was for you, not for me?

52
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,860
I'm cold.

53
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,040
My vulnerability has stirred your heart, hasn't it?

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,100
- Is that a whale behind you?
- Where?

55
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,040
Li Yubing!

56
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,980
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,870
Do you know how cold the ocean water is on a day like this?

58
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,060
Let me see.

59
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,640
Thank you.

60
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,440
Other than the Western psychology methods, there are other methods our ancestors passed down

61
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,190
that are equally effective. For example: the ruse of injury.

62
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,290
Why are you shivering so much? Are you sick?

63
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,480
Should we look for a hospital?

64
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,170
Where are we going to find a hospital around here?

65
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,720
It's okay, I brought cold medicine with me. Let's take some cold medicine first.

66
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,770
- It's okay. It's not that serious.
- Are you sure?

67
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,320
It's bad. It's bad.

68
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,370
It was so cold outside and the water was so icy. He might be seriously ill, at worse, he might have pneumonia.

69
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,500
Is your head dizzy? Is your nose runny?

70
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,230
- Are you nauseous? Do you have tinnitus (ringing in your ear?)
- What did you say?

71
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,710
This is bad! He might have pneumonia. Pneumonia!

72
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,660
- Then let's go back tonight.
- Go back?

73
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,510
Actually, I don't think it's that serious. Isn't that right?

74
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,170
- It's not that serious.
- Li Yubing's body is strong from playing so much hockey.

75
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,600
Why don't we let him rest, monitor his condition, and then make a decision?

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,920
Yeah, let's just monitor and see how it goes.

77
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,460
Then, you have to take good care of him tonight.

78
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,500
Me? I can't do it. When I sleep, I grind my teeth, fart a lot, and I snore.

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,670
I'm afraid of scaring him. He already had such a scare from falling into the ocean today. If I scare him more at night,

80
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,410
- that would be rubbing salt in the wound. Right?
- He can't do it.

81
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,590
You two are staying in the same room. If you don't take care of him, who will?

82
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,990
Who-Who will take care of him? The person...

83
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,370
who made him fall into the water should take care of him.

84
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,480
- How could you come up with this kind of idea? Don't you know a boy and girl–
- I'll take care of him.

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,570
It's my fault he fell in the water. I'll take full responsibility.

86
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,910
- You guys go and get some rest.
- Master Tang!

87
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,490
Sleep on the floor tonight.

88
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,970
At most the couch.

89
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,830
Master Tang, I–

90
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,900
Rest up, rest up.

91
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,310
- Thank you.
- Go, go.

92
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,280
Wear slippers. Go slowly.

93
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,510
Huan-huan, it's been a long day. Let's get some rest. Do you want to take a hot shower first?

94
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,330
So you can comfortably get some rest.

95
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,300
I realized you truly have a generous heart.

96
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,880
How did your species survive evolution?

97
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,320
You're not sleepy? Should we watch a movie?

98
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I can prepare some drinks and snacks for you.

99
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,230
I've realized you're not worried at all.

100
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,330
The two of you didn't arrange this on purpose, did you?

101
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,200
No, of course not! How could we? He's sick.

102
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,270
Look at me.

103
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,560
- He's sick.
- Whether he's sick or not, I'll know once I take a look at him.

104
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,640
Hey. Huan-huan.

105
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,360
What are you doing?

106
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,790
Hey, Huan-huan!

107
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,710
- Come in.
- Master Tang.

108
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,960
I came prepared with fever relieving medicine and a thermometer. Here.

109
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
What?

110
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,130
- Thank you, Huan-huan.
- Thank you.

111
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,150
I don't need my temperature taken.

112
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,540
- Hold it in there. You got it?
- I got it.

113
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,190
Master Tang. Here, when you're sick you should drink more hot water.

114
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,200
Here, I'll put it on your bedside table. I'm putting it here for you.

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,560
Master Tang, come here! Let me see.

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,300
What's this in your hair? Don't move.

117
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,270
- What?
- Wait. Don't move.

118
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,330
- What is it?
- Let me see. Don't!

119
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,270
Don't move, don't move! I've almost got it. The light isn't good over here. Don't move.

120
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,440
Hold on, hold on. The lighting's not great.

121
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,280
- I got it! What a big piece of dandruff, you should wash your hair soon.
- Are you done?

122
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,320
- That's impossible. I never have dandruff.
- You didn't wash your hair.

123
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,860
That fast?

124
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,860
38 degrees? (Celsius)

125
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,790
- Take the medicine, quickly.
- Medicine?!

126
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,040
If your fever doesn't break by tomorrow morning, we'll go to urgent care immediately.

127
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,290
I don't need to take medicine.

128
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,840
- Hold this.
- I don't need to drink the water either.

129
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,710
If you don't take medicine, how will you get better?

130
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,910
1, 2—

131
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,700
I won't eat it.

132
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,700
Open your mouth.

133
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,920
- Drink it.
- I already swallowed the medicine.

134
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,260
Sick people need to drink lots of hot water.

135
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,760
If you don't drink hot water, how will your fever go down?

136
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
I already took the medicine, can I not drink–

137
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,350
3, 2—

138
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,940
Why are you pinching me?

139
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,870
This is to punish you for exhausting my patience.

140
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,970
- What?
- Drink it.

141
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,990
Is it okay? I'm going to go see how things are going.

142
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,670
Everything's fine. Master Tang's taking good care of him. He's really sick. She just took his temperature, and it's 38.8 degrees.

143
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,920
I'll go take a look.

144
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,980
You don't need to go. She has it under control, trust me. Let's just go.

145
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,110
- Really?
- Really, really. Let's go.

146
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,110
Let's just let him rest.

147
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,200
What are you so smiling about?

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,220
Nothing.

149
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,050
Why do you think I'm smiling?

150
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,540
It's nothing. I just—

151
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,860
- Liao Zhenyu.
- Present.

152
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm warning you! What happened today, only the two of us can know about it. No one else can know.

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,930
About what?

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,550
About me getting stung by a jellyfish today, and you...

155
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,640
using... that to help me.

156
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,780
Did— Did that happen?

157
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,370
That's more like it.

158
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,460
The wind's too strong.

159
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,090
Is Li Yubing really sick?

160
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,990
He is! He's really sick.

161
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,010
Master Tang checked the thermometer. It said 38 degrees.

162
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,480
If-if you were to get sick,

163
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,390
I would take care of you like this, too.

164
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,900
Of course, I would be 3,000 times gentler than Master Tang.

165
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,440
Did you get stung by a jellyfish?

166
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,150
We have to take care of this quickly, or it'll hurt a lot.

167
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,390
Liao Zhenyu!

168
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,840
Xiao Xia, I've come to protect you!

169
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,040
Like-minded people will be the ones who come together. The two of us should not contact each other as often in the future.

170
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,150
If you are a different kind, I will strive to be your kind.

171
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,660
We can help them for a short time, but not forever.

172
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,970
Don't worry, I'm here.

173
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,450
For the creation of Home for Homeless Babies, I have to especially thank one person.

174
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,710
From the Medical School,

175
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,110
Liao Zhenyu.

176
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,970
Why do you treat me so well?

177
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,510
Do you want to hear the truth?

178
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,810
Of course.

179
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:04,100
Before, I just thought you were pretty and cute, so I wanted you to be my girlfriend.

180
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,970
What about now?

181
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,830
Now... I also don't know what changed.

182
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,480
Now, I just want to treat you well. If you're happy, I'm happy.

183
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,980
So you don't want me to be your girlfriend anymore?

184
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,840
Who said that? Even in my dreams, I think about it.

185
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,540
Look.

186
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,030
Look! This is our bet. Look at the condition I put down.

187
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,250
[Be my girl!]

188
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,600
Wow, what a scheme.

189
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
It was kind of scheming of me to write this condition, but

190
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,170
that's my wish.

191
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,770
Master Tang is free to choose who she ends up with.

192
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,930
Right? Let's be honest. Even if we try to intervene, we can't determine her outcome.

193
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,820
But to me, this is my wish; my dream.

194
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,950
♫ ...no need to say more ♫

195
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,710
♫ Relying on sweetness to pass the time of boring loneliness ♫

196
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,710
I'm going to tell you something that you might not believe.

197
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,730
The first time I met you, I started thinking about how we should decorate our house in the future.

198
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,510
Don't laugh.

199
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,620
What I mean is... The first time I saw you,

200
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,870
I thought, she's the one.

201
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,250
♫ I just want to embrace you in this moment ♫

202
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,690
♫ My heart was healed by you long ago ♫

203
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,610
♫ It has started falling into every corner of you ♫

204
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,600
Starting right now, you're my boyfriend.

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,250
What'd you say? What'd you say?

206
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,490
If you didn't hear it, forget it.

207
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,920
Just say it one more time. What'd you say?

208
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,690
From now on, you're my boyfriend.

209
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,200
Really?

210
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,130
Yes!

211
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,200
♫ You pout and quietly hum ♫

212
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,820
♫ The song that makes my heart beat, singing you like me ♫

213
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,910
♫ Singing the song that makes my heart beat ♫

214
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,470
Tang Xue, please don't get angry at my mom. Don't fall for someone else.

215
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,580
Is this live streaming someone bathing?

216
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,860
If you're taking a bath, you should let me know. And you can't take a bath right now anyway.

217
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,350
I'm not taking a bath.

218
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,480
You're... not naked?

219
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,320
No.

220
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,930
I'm fully clothed.

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,560
Then, what are you doing in there?

222
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,980
I'm just looking at the sky. The stars are really pretty tonight.

223
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,440
Move over.

224
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,930
It really is pretty.

225
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,160
Tang Xue, I...

226
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,510
I'm sorry.

227
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,730
What were you saying?

228
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,230
Nothing.

229
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,380
This candy is expired, you should throw it away.

230
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,890
What will happen if I eat this candy?

231
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,250
Your stomach will hurt, and you'll have to go to the hospital for a shot to get better.

232
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,740
So don't eat expired things, understand?

233
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,240
I understand. I'll feed it to a stray dog then.

234
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,100
Imported candy? There's so much left, too.

235
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,180
Yeah.

236
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,660
Won't you have a stomachache after eating it? I'll try it for you.

237
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,900
She's so shameless.

238
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,470
I hope her stomach hurts right now and she has to go to the hospital to get a shot.

239
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,510
Make way, make way.

240
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,010
Xiao Tang Xue, what's wrong? What did you eat?

241
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,160
It's candy that's ex... ex... ex...

242
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,640
Spit it out, let me see.

243
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,050
You're losing teeth. Everyone else in the class is losing teeth, too. You're the only one being so dramatic about it.

244
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,880
Okay. Everyone, go back to your seats.

245
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
It's okay! Everything's fine.

246
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,920
I want to eat another one.

247
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,040
I'm not giving you any more.

248
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,570
You promised to give it to me.

249
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,420
I regret it.

250
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,130
I suddenly remembered when you took my candy from me when we were younger.

251
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,390
So stingy, not even willing to share a piece of candy.

252
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,530
That's because the candy was expired.

253
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,500
Expired?

254
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,200
That's why you wouldn't give it to me?

255
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,400
If she knew I gave it to her on purpose, she'd probably kill me.

256
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,510
Yeah.

257
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,520
Hurry up and get better.

258
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,770
Goodnight, Boyfriend.

259
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,550
Goodnight, Girlfriend.

260
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,090
I'm going.

261
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,190
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

262
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,270
I have to admit.

263
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,510
This dog is pretty good-looking.

264
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,110
You're up so early.

265
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,950
Why did you sleep here?

266
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,050
Yesterday, you fell asleep after we stayed up talking, so I carried you to the bed.

267
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,860
Let's take your temperature again. If you're better, we can go back to school.

268
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,540
Can you get me a cup of hot water?

269
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,870
You can't take a bath.

270
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,040
Li Yubing, you lied to me.

271
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,350
Brother Bing, Brother Bring. This trip was really successful. Thank you.

272
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,580
It was successful for you. How did it become me helping you instead?

273
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,860
Don't be so stingy. We'll keep trying. It'll work.

274
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,030
Tang Xue.

275
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,350
You're still angry?

276
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,380
I was just joking. I just thought...

277
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,140
You thought it'd be warm, right?

278
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,870
You thought it'd remind you of your mom.

279
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,120
You still shouldn't lie. Lying is wrong.

280
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,420
You made me worry all night long.

281
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,790
- Tang Xue.
- See. This is the consequence of lying. Understand?

282
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,480
- Your bag, your bag.
- Master Tang!

283
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,200
It's over. You just lied to her for one night and it's like this,

284
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,550
let alone six years.

285
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,270
Why did you make it worse?

286
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,070
Saying it reminded me of my mom? What were you thinking?

287
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,210
Brother Bing, don't worry. Rome wasn't built in one day, right?

288
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,070
- I'm going then.
- Leave!

289
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,660
Again? What Teacher Deng? What Psychology of Dating?

290
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,390
I'll report you!

291
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,540
I want to yank him out of the screen and hit him until he can't think straight.

292
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,030
I really want to grab him out of the screen. I'll beat him up until he's dead.

293
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,040
Brother Bing, comfort me.

294
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,510
What is it?

295
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,840
I've been scammed by an idiot.

296
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,610
I know the feeling.

297
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,890
There's an idiot on the internet who owes me his life.

298
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,100
For my class, I researched and copied all over the internet.

299
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,360
Just to get materials, I spent hundreds.

300
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Just after I sold a class for ¥99,

301
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,880
someone reported me.

302
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,310
Why are people these days so disrespectful of other people's hard work?

303
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,890
Wait a second. A ¥99 class?

304
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,980
Why does it sound so familiar?

305
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,630
Have you seen my ads before?

306

Let me tell you! My work

312
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,800
is impressive. What does everyone call me? Dating Expert.

313
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,850
Impressive, you said?

314
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,420
How can something so impressive

315
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,120
get reported?

316
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,390
I was going easy on you by reporting you.

317
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,650
Who are you working with? What's wrong with you, Li Yubing?

318
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,040
What's wrong with me is that I was dumb enough to spend money on your class.

319
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,180
- You bought it?
- You've never dated before! What are you doing pretending you're an expert?

320
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,930
I must have been out of my mind.

321
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,170
When Darwin was researching humans' origin, he had never been a monkey before either.

322
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,790
The origin of humans?

323
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,840
More importantly, you need to trust in love.

324
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,620
Trust in love. Trust in love? Dating Expert? Let me tell you.

325
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,830
Today, I'll show you what an expert is.

326
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,320
When are you coming back?

327
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,410
This is really yummy.

328
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,310
I guess you guys still have some conscience.

329
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,860
Did you guys get anything out of the trip?

330
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,030
Sister Huan got love.

331
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,400
But even though we went on the same trip, we had different experiences.

332
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,020
I was knocked down by friendship.

333
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,730
Love? You and Xiao Liao...

334
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,350
Don't ask.

335
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,010
The barren land has grown flowers!

336

Congratulations.

337

How did you get knocked down by friendship?

338
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,070
Life doesn't always go the way you want.

339
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,540
My good intentions were eaten up by a dog.

340
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,760
Yesterday, Yu Yan...

341
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,970
Yu Yan came looking for you saying...

342
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,930
he needs to talk to you about something in person.

343
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,830
I'll go look for him then.

344
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,290
- You're not scared to go look for him?
- Why would I be scared?

345
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,030
Here.

346
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,850
You brought this back from the beach?

347
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,130
I heard you were looking for me.

348
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,870
I'm sorry. My mom...

349
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,750
You know about it?

350
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,770
If my mom said anything mean to you, don't take it to heart.

351
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,440
She's just like that. She doesn't have any bad intentions.

352
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,630
I know. Even though I don't agree with some of the things she said,

353
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,100
but I know she just wants the best for you.

354
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,090
Are you still angry?

355
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,770
My attitude wasn't great that day either. Your mom was probably holding back, too.

356
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,460
Let's call it even.

357
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,320
But I think she misunderstood our relationship. You should find time to explain it to her.

358
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,180
By the way, my mom found a Canadian choreographer for me.

359
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,990
She wants me to go abroad to train.

360
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,980
Really? That's great! When are you leaving?

361
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,170
Even if you want to stay,

362
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,020
does that person want you to stay?

363
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,310
I don't want to go.

364
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,860
Why not? This is such a great opportunity.

365
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,950
Opportunity?

366
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,810
I don't know which opportunity I should grab onto.

367
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,880
Of course, it's the opportunity to go to Canada.

368
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,350
But then we won't be able to see each other for a really long time.

369
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,640
It's just a time difference.

370
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,950
We'll use your time zone.

371
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,410

372
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,460
Yesterday, Li Yubing went with you?

373
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,250
Yeah, with Xia Menghuan and Little Yuzi.

374
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,410
We took the Black Pearl ship out to sea.

375
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,600
That black and that pig, let me tell you that it was really something.

376
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,840
Li Yubing, that dog, he had the nerve to lie to me and pretend he had a fever from falling into the ocean.

377
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,960
Why is it that you've come back, but you feel further away from me?

378
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,330
I felt guilty all night long, you know?

379
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,180
It was my fault he fell in the water. I'll take full responsibility.

380
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,320
Hurry up and get better.

381
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,730
Tang Xue, I...

382
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,850
I'm sorry.

383
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,300
Why is that when I'm with you, so many accidents always happen?

384
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,550
What are you doing number 19? Catch!

385
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,760
This pear looks pretty good.

386
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,960
It's a sour pear. The woman selling it told me it was sweeter than first love.

387
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,060
I don't think she understands what first love is.

388
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,080
This is a snow pear. You're supposed to stew it with crystal sugar for it to be good.

389
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,360
Do you have a pot? How are you going to stew it?

390
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,960
Why are you thinking so hard about it? If you're not going to eat it, give it back to me.

391
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,560
Go away. Why would I turn down a free pear?

392
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,350
So mischievous.

Darling, how was today?

It was okay.

What's wrong?

399
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,570
My deskmate... she's too dumb.

400
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,250
How can you say that about your classmate.

401
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,110
Kindness is the most important trait of a person.

402
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,470
You can't complain just because you think a classmate is dumb.

403
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,810
Doing that is very narrow-minded. Do you understand?

404
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,430
- Understood.
- Very good.

Mom, what does it mean to be childhood friends?

410
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,790
It means that two people have grown up together.

Hello, Tang Xue? Do you have time to meet up?

Last time, I pretended I was sick because I li—

Because you wanted warmth, is that it?

418

463
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:58,870
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

464
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:06,250
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

465
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:12,930
The first time I held your hand, my breathing became
erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

466
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:19,280
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

467
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,520
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

468
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,840
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

469
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:39,360
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

470
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,170
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

471
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:48,120
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

472
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,540
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

473
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,430
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

474
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:01,300
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

475
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:07,950
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

476
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:14,260
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

477
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:20,740
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

478
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:27,180
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

479
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:33,210
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal

you traveling ♫

483
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:59,460

484
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:06,300
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

485
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,690
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

486
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:20,180
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

487
