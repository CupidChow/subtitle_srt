[Episode 31]

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,420
I didn't want to look for you.

19
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,530
But exams are coming up soon. Everyone is studying and I couldn't find anybody,

20
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,850
so I came to ask you for help.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,720
If you miss me then just tell me.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
What did you say?

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,900
I said that I'm your boyfriend. If you don't come to disturb me then who are you going to disturb?

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,820
I'm waiting for you all day to disturb me.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,520
All right, stop kidding. Let's start now.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,960
Start what? You didn't even tell me what you need me to help you with.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,170
In the exam for our animal association,

28
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,530
aside from some outdoor survival skills and other subjects,

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,640
there is a lot of specialized English vocabulary.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,860
I've been memorizing them. I just want you to test me.

31
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,940
Okay.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,830
Test me.

33
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,670
- What is this?
- Chimpanzee.

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,080
Obviously. Am I testing you to name the picture? What is it in English?

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,500
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous. This one...

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,820
C H I M P A N Z E E. Chimpanzee.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,040
Okay.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,340
What about this one?

39
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,330
This is... C H A M E L E O N. Chameleon.

40
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,180
Good. This isn't hard for you.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,800
This isn't hard for you? Let's change it.

42
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,020
What animal is this?

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,470
Wait a second.

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,350
My mind is blank. Cuttlefish?

45
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,730
- What kind of fish?
- Think harder.

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,580
I can't think of it.

47
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,420
How about this? Look at me.

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,220
This animal in the ocean is...

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,290
Jellyfish?

50
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,080
It can throw up.

51
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,500
What is that?

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,210
Fine. Never mind then, it was Wu Zei (Cuttlefish).

53
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,820
Really. Remember that.

54
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,550
- Cuttlefish, right here.
- What was that "pu" sound?

55
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,680
How about this? The words that you're not familiar with

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,890
I'll take them out so you can go back and study them.

57
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,360
This one.

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,090
This one, review these words well when you go back and then you're all good.

59
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,850
Okay. Do you think I'll pass?

60
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,810
Of course! Or else, what was the point of us doing all those things, right?

61
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,830
How about this?

62
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,480
I'll imitate another for you and then you guess what kind of animal it is.

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,940
Okay.

64
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,650
Guess, guess. What was the animal I was just imitating?

65
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,000
What was it? You weirdo.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,090
I was imitating a Liao Zhenyu that loves you.

67
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,090
You're so childish. Go back to your seat. It's so embarrassing!

68
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,290
I was thinking you've been too tense these days. I just wanted to help you relax a little.

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,640
How's your preparation going?

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,750
I... It's going okay.

71
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,870
But it's not that simple.

72
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,530
Tada!

73
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,740
I made time to make this for you.

74
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,060
Lucky note.

75
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,380
"Thousands of words for Yu." Is this character written correctly like my Yu?

76
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,630
Open it to see.

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,470
"Thousands of words for Yu. Chat with you Huanppily. Yu and Huan."

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,270
I like it.

79
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,820
What happened to your hand? Did you get injured?

80
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,750
I'm not that weak. Are you dumb? This is lipstick.

81
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,330
It got on my hand when I was doing Xiao Ye's makeup.

82
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,440
Oh, it's lipstick. You scared me.

83
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,220
Wait! Who did you say was doing makeup?

84
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,360
Xiao Ye.

85
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,360
Dr. Ye wears makeup?

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,460
Oh my god. There are so many wonders in this world. Why did she put on makeup?

87
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,730
She was talking to someone online and she's going to meet him.

88
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,910
Online friend? And meeting them?

89
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,570
Actually, you are quite cute. Having a sense of knowledge.

90
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,960
You are not bad yourself. Strong, safe, and reliable.

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,780
Can you give me a chance to love you?

92
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,450
Chances are for those who are prepared.

93
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,630
If we can find some common language.

94
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,520
Do you like Zhu Shenghao?

95
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Boiled oysters?
(T/N: sounds the same as Zhu Shenghao in Chinese)

96
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,030
I like eating them raw.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,510
- Why is she the only one who understands me?
- Why is he the only one who understands me?

98
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,950
- What the hell?
- Right.

99
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,870
Why are you so into studying today?

100
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,420
Bing-bing, you're back. Look at this.

101
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,470
This article is a bit strange.

102
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,840
The article says no one cares about ice hockey and it's asking everyone to pay more attention to it.

103
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,960
That's not right. I remember there weren't such few people during our competition.

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,170
Right? I also think this photo is photoshopped.

105
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,720
Let me look at my own photos.

106
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,940
It is photoshopped.

107
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,960
Using any tactics just to win an award?

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,390
How could they photoshop it like that?

109
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,450
I got it.

110
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,320
Ice hockey is not very popular but not to the point that no one cares.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,130
Who wants to learn to play after this news comes out.

112
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,180
Are you planning to report him openly?

113
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,880
Of course! Fake news like this discourage interests in ice hockey. I can't let it happen.

114
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,490
Nice.

115
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,630
Hello, Bian Cheng?

116
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,910
Zhou Ran, I found out something about Li Yubing.

117
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,730
I already told you. I'm really tired of this already.

118
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,480
Li Yubing is no longer my target.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,580
No need to tell me anything about him anymore.

120
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,560
Are you sure?

121
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,260
You shouldn't do such unnecessary things anymore either. I'm afraid you'll regret it later on.

122
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,160
I want you to guarantee that Li Yubing won't be able to participate that day.

123
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,350
You guys think of what method to use yourself.

124
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,120
I told you my daughter could do it. She got on the national team shortlist!

125
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,010
Mom, I still don't know if I can get into the team yet.

126
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,990
Of course, you can!

127
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,690
When you're there, you have to take good care of yourself.

128
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,460
We won't be able to take care of you, and that Li Yubing won't be there either...

129
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,190
When we meet Li Yubing later,

130
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,830
don't be so arrogant, don't pull a long face, and don't be too serious.

131
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,540
- But don't be too nice. My dad's scary when he's too nice.
- You're right.

132
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,760
Tang Xue's dad wants to meet you? Silly son, that's a good thing. Why are you so nervous for?

133
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,510
That's right, my son is so handsome.

134
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,750
It's necessary to get prepared. I have experience in that.

135
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,920
You can't talk too much.

136
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,620
If you talk too much it'll show that you are not earnest. You can't argue with him.

137
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,950
But you have to say something. Just sitting there will make you look stupid, that's not going to work.

138
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't mention ice hockey.

139
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,700
But you can encourage him.

140
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,180
Don't be too obsessed with the wording.

141
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,410
But you have to adequately display your scholarly demeanor.

142
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,690
Your biased view is taboo.

143
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,970
But you can't follow the main stream either.

144
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,220
When you meet Tang Xue's parents, make sure you say some nice words.

145
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,490
Don't be reserved and act arrogant.

146
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,850
But also don't be too eager.

147
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,540
- You can't let them feel you're too slick; that's not earnest.
- Don't joke around.

148
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,200
But keep a proper sense of humor, you know?

149
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,750
Bragging is taboo.

150
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,230
Sometimes if you're too modest,

151
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,230
people might resent that.

152
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,740
Anyways, you need to find the right balance.

153
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,160
You must not be nervous.

154
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,390
Just chat and have fun.

155
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,610
Right. Have fun.

156
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,170
Most important of all, you have to be happy when chatting.

157
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,400
Okay, I know. I'll leave now.

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,970
Go on then.

159
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,930
Okay, I got it.

160
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,770
Why isn't he here yet?

161
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,830
- Uncle. Auntie.
- Yubing!

162
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,960
Come, come. Have a seat.

163
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,710
What do you want to drink?

164
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,400
Auntie, I don't need a drink.

165
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,250
This time Xue's dad and I came to visit her.

166
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,740
Her dad asked me to especially invite you here.

167
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,840
He said that Xue has made such an achievement

168
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,190
due to much of your help. He wanted me to thank you.

169
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,640
Actually, I didn't do anything. I'm just like Uncle,

170
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,400
only giving Tang Xue moral support.

171
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,590
I also heard your XDragon Team has a chance of winning

172
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,110
the National University Hockey Tournament this year. Is that right?

173
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,570
Yes, right now the whole team is working really hard for that.

174
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,900
Good, you can do it!

175
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,570
Thank you, Auntie.

176
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,170
Uh... I heard that ice hockey competitions

177
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,420
don't really have much of an audience.

178
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,630
That profession is pretty difficult.

179
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,090
Uncle, actually it's really not like that.

180
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,590
Right now, ice hockey is in a situation of rejuvenation.

181
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,530
There will definitely be more and more people paying attention to it.

182
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,860
For example, right now when young children go compete; there are easily over a hundred teams.

183
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,890
In addition, the construction of new skating rinks in the country is experiencing explosive growth.

184
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,020
So you're saying that there aren't just a few people watching the sport, right?

185
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,590
That's right.

186
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,160
Even though it isn't necessarily an explosive sport, but it isn't without interest.

187
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,500
Yesterday, I just read an article that said

188
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,340
there weren't many people interested in ice hockey. It made me angry.

189
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,450
By writing that, it can attract some sympathizers to come and watch the competition,

190
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,560
but from a long term perspective, lots of people who want to learn to play hockey

191
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,820
may cause them to dampen their enthusiasm.

192
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,970
I just can't believe that this kind of article was able to win a big award for the Journalism Commentary Competition.

193
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,450
It won an award?

194
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,730
Uh... that...

195
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,350
The article that won the Journalism Competition...

196
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,200
Actually...

197
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,340
Hello, Xiao Wang.

198
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,940
I'm out handling a matter. We'll talk about it when I get back, okay?

199
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,540
Hang up. Hurry and hang up.

200
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,250
What?

201
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,820
Bian Cheng's news report was falsified?

202
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,160
They want to deal with our office?

203
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,330
Someone openly made a complaint against us?

204
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,710
Li Yubing?

205
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,500
I understand.

206
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,840
What's going on?

207
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,670
Uncle.

208
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,830
What does Bian Cheng's article have to do with you?

209
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,610
His news report was published in our paper.

210
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,110
I didn't know about that.

211
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,570
- Uncle...
- Dad!

212
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,340
I'll go deal with this. Wherever you go for training, you must be careful.

213
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,330
Be careful.

214
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,140
What's going on?

215
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,210
Tada!

216
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,680
You can't blame Li Yubing. It's all because of Bian Cheng.

217
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,390
I know Li Yubing did nothing wrong, but that's my dad.

218
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,790
I don't even know myself, I don't understand.

219
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,640
Nothing's without hardship and recurrence.

220
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,390
Bing-bing, do you regret reporting Bian Cheng?

221
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,750
It interfered with the great reconciliation between you and Uncle Tang.

222
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,430
I don't regret it at all. I think I did the right thing.

223
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,430
But the way Tang Xue looks at me now, it feels like she wants to kill me.

224
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,030
- What?
- It doesn't matter if you die or not.

225
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,150
I'm dying.

226
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,230
I already smell it.

227
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,290
You're back?

228
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,390
You must be tired.

229
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,430
How's it going?

230
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,550
It's all dealt with.

231
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,910
I did a briefing report and have three months' salary suspended.

232
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,580
You even got your salary suspended?

233
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,870
At first, leadership just asked me to do a briefing report.

234
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,060
I was the one who asked to suspend my salary.

235
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,310
After all, it is due to my mistake that this news article was released.

236
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,470
I should take on the appropriate consequences.

237
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,070
Oh right, did you find that child?

238
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,690
He doesn't answer my calls.

239
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,740
He doesn't reply back to my messages. I'm thinking...

240
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,000
I need to find the time and talk to him in person.

241
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,360
He doesn't answer your call nor your messages. What's the point in finding him?

242
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,670
He's clearly avoiding it.

243
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,570
Why do you need to talk to him?

244
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,370
This child is still quite talented.

245
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,700
But he used tricks to take a shortcut.

246
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,180
By the way.

247
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,660
Because of you,

248
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,870
Xue and Li Yubing are having problems.

249
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,650
Xue thinks it's Li Yubing who wronged you.

250
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,940
This silly kid.

251
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,520
How can the daughter of I, Tang Hongjiang,

252
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,070
not know what is right and wrong?

253
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,970
That won't do. I'll go to Lincheng right now.

254
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,020
Right now?

255
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,410
You once said you wanted to be a journalist for a Pulitzer.

256
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,140
To be a watchman at the bow,

257
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,000
to examine the unexpected and hidden danger,

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,760
and issue a timely warning.

259
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,650
This issue is over. Don't forget why you started.

260
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,040
Your favorite dumplings.

261
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,560
Your mom insisted I bring them to you.

262
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,980
Sorry, Dad.

263
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,610
What's wrong?

264
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,310
It's all Li Yubing's fault.

265
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,470
He... He never intended to hurt you.

266
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,820
So you think what he did was wrong?

267
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,730
Tell me the truth.

268
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,940
No.

269
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,030
He didn't do anything wrong.

270
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,790
This incident happened because of my mistake.

271
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,440
Actually, we journalists...

272
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,420
should show the truth of society.

273
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,010
If the report

274
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,760
turns out to be wrong,

275
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,900
someone should point it out.

276
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,110
Li Yubing did the right thing.

277
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,290
Originally, I didn't like Li Yubing that much.

278
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,040
But after this,

279
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,730
I'm actually quite impressed.

280
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,850
Uncle.

281
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,030
Did I let you sit?

282
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,210
You have the shame to sit?

283
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,520
Do you know how far over the line you went this time? Do you know how much trouble

284
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,430
my dad is in because of you?

285
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,670
Uncle, I was wrong.

286
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,190
Hey.

287
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,780
Do you really think you're wrong?

288
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,810
I don't want to hear an insincere apology.

289
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,930
Sorry. I don't think I did anything wrong.

290
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,560
Because I think if something's wrong,

291
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,320
it must be corrected. So even if I was given another chance,

292
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,810
I'd still make the same decision.

293
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,850
You—

294
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,770
You did the right thing.

295
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,510
What... What's going on?

296
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,560
You should stick to the right thing,

297
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,420
don't go against your principles for anyone.

298
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,410
Thank you, Uncle.

299
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,050
I came this time

300
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,960
to finish what I didn't say last time.

301
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,310
I want to apologize to you guys.

302
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,060
Don't say that, Uncle.

303
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,040
I shouldn't have used "For your own good" as a reason

304
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,960
to stop you from chasing the life you want.

305
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,650
Luckily, you have enough persistence.

306
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,580
So... I hope you can keep up the good work.

307
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,320
Thank you, Uncle.

308
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,920
You must help each other and improve together.

309
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,890
- Here. Eat some dumplings.
- Okay.

310
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,200
Who did you say this was for just now?

311
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,690
I brought it for you... and him.

312
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,120
My uncle and Tang Xue are both looking for you.

313
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,240
How much longer are you going to hide?

314
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,880
Right now, everyone looks at me with daggers in their eyes.

315
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,370
Where can I go?

316
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,880
Have you thought of the reason why?

317
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,600
Just because of those so-called goals you have, have you forgotten more important things?

318
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,690
Zhou Ran, maybe Li Yubing doesn't mean much to you, but Tang Xue is different.

319
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,170
She's the most important person to me.

320
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,810
The problem is has Tang Xue agreed to it?

321
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,410
Have you thought about how Tang Xue and Li Yubing have become better people

322
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,540
because they like each other?

323
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:02,080
Then how about us? Have we become better people because we like them?

324
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,020
Bian Cheng,

325
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,370
I always thought that you were one of the most outstanding people amongst our classmates.

326
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,340
It's true I haven't become a better person.

327
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,010
But I believe I will definitely end up with Tang Xue, then everything will get better.

328
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,930
You're still not going to give up on Tang Xue?

329
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,650
There is nothing I cannot accomplish.

330
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,730
When are you going to wake up?

331
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,660
Zhou Ran, if you've come just to say such things,

332
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,340
the door is over there. Walk yourself out.

333
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,410
My uncle has been criticized by the press because of this.

334
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,280
But he says that he doesn't blame you. He thinks that young people will make mistakes.

335
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,570
He just thinks that it's unfortunate. I know that you're smart.

336
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,550
I know that you are aware of the problem already. But if you still don't fix it,

337
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,200
then you're just not smart enough.

338
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,300
Li Yubing, it's all because of you.

339
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,910
For this to be fair, I should let you experience what this feels like.

340
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,220
What's going on?

341
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,800
It really fell.

342
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,700
Big Jiang.

343
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,690
You're the strong one here.

344
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,350
I told the chairman about what happened last time.

345
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,630
The chairman didn't agree. I'm really sorry.

346
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,590
About what?

347
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,790
Your contract with the XDragons Team.

348
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:07,370
To be honest, you are indeed a good player in the college league level.

349
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,980
But in terms of the professional league,

350
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,080
you might have to improve a little more on your skills.

351
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,360
Did someone tell you about this?

352
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,970
Yes. Li Yubing talked to me about it.

353
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,150
He said you both cooperate well. In the future, when you both play in the professional league,

354
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,820
you both can be even better at cooperating.

355
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,610
But this is a little bit difficult.

356
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,490
Our chairman wants to create a first-tier powerhouse team,

357
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,270
but your skills...

358
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,000
But don't worry.

359
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,740
If there are any other professional league teams looking for new players, I'll look out for that.

360
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,970
All right now. Don't bother to do that.

361
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,610
I'll find them myself.

362
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,340
Thank you.

363
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,140
Why is he angry? Did I say it in a way that wasn't euphemistic enough?

364
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,750
What are you daydreaming for?

365
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,240
Li Yubing.

366
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,620
Did you ask Manager Ma for a favor?

367
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,600
Yes.

368
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,380
I just described the situation to him.

369
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm grateful that you're good to me,

370
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,290
but I know what I'm capable of.

371
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,780
You doing this only makes me more embarrassed!

372
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,810
What? Do you need to rely on human relations to play ice hockey now?

373
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,880
If that's true, then I'd rather leave XDragons now.

374
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,170
Are you kidding me?

375
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,780
I'm serious.

376
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,270
If you leave XDragons, where are you going to go?

377
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,820
I won't play here depending on relations with other people.

378
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,120
How is this relying on relations?!

379
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,460
Do you know that you value your self-esteem too much right now?

380
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,250
Li Yubing! Then please respect my self-esteem!

381
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,550
Hey.

382
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,350
What's wrong with Big Jiang?

383
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,490
I told Manager Ma about his contract with XDragons. And now he's mad.

384
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,670
He should be angry.

385
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,200
I wanted to help him, okay?

386
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,090
Do you think that if XDragons signs with him, the problem will be resolved?

387
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,010
If that's not the case, then what?

388
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,580
After his contract ends, are you going to continue to ask Manager Ma to renew his contract?

389
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,800
Even if XDragons decides to renew his contract because of you,

390
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,720
if Big Jiang's not good enough, do you think the Coach will let him play?

391
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,030
Do you want him to be a bench player all his life?

392
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,750
Actually, he's not any less passionate about ice hockey than you.

393
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,750
It's just that sometimes hard work doesn't always pay off.

394
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,920
For Big Jiang, is staying in XDragons the only and best choice he has?

395
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,530
If you love ice hockey, you don't have to be a great player.

396
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,290
If you blindly encourage him to pursue something that's not meant for him,

397
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,500
are you really helping him?

398
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,350
But I know he... he wants to play ice hockey.

399
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,030
I understand. But as his closest two friends,

400
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,070
it's more important for us to help him think it through than paving a way for him.

401
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,680
Am I wrong?

402
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,800
Let's go.

403
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,060
What's going on?

404
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:59,120
Why do I feel like the air is filled with gunpowder?

405
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,910
Fatty,

406
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,500
tell him his moves today were not up to standards.

407
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:11,490
Fatty, tell him I am aware of my problems.

408
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,810
Tell him he'll never make it into a professional team with what he did today.

409
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,860
Tell him it's not any of his business even if I can't get in.

410
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,650
Okay. Walk your own path.

411
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,100
No matter what,

412
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,300
I'll support you.

413
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,840
Well...

414
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,300
I don't care whichever paths you pick, please pay the tolls: ¥500 each.

415
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,600
100, 200, 300, 400!

416
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,830
There's such a story between these two?

417
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,290
How can two big men be this bashful?

418
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:17,170
So shy and... indirect.

419
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,900
Haven't you heard? Good fights make closer bros.

420
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,320
Exactly.

421
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,410
Is today Liao Zhenyu's official first day?

422
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,010
I asked him to prepare something. Why didn't he come early to prepare?

423
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,390
So careless. Don't you remember what day it is?

424
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,460
Huan-huan,

425
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,350
do you remember them all?

426
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,270
Yes. Don't worry. I'll be fine.

427
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,780
It's a long test. I put chocolate in your bag. Remember to have some.

428
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,920
Don't be anxious when you don't know something. the others won't know either. Just keep going.

429
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,010
I'm just going for two days. You're rambling non-stop.

430
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,630
I'm just worried.

I got it. Bye-bye.

440
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,610
- Liao Zhenyu, right? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

441
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,290
Why are your hands shaking? You're even sweating.

It's okay, don't be nervous.

The team doctor has told us you're doing quite well.

446
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,860
Our ice hockey team happens to lack a team doctor to follow along.

447
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,620

You can travel with the team to competitions in the future.

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,850
- Gather some more knowledge in sports injury prevention and treatment.
- Okay, okay.

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,040
- Better safe than sorry.

456
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,150
Not much. I just wanted to

457
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,560
officially apologize to you.

458
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,090
Apologize to... me?

459
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,220
Before, I used your feelings for me because of Li Yubing.

460

I may have hurt you in some way or another.

But I've already given up on him now.

462
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,360
I also did some things I shouldn't have.

463
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,300
So I hope you can forgive me.

464

I-I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend you.

I was just thinking, I'm holding the hand of the goddess in my heart,

but why isn't my heart racing?

[International Apartment]

478
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,970
Jealous again?

479
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,500
So much.

480
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,830
He's a world champion. How can I compare to him?

481
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,950
But only you can be my boyfriend.

482
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:24,230
Because you are the club's only hope of a world champion title.

483
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,070
Li Yubing is popular, but the ice hockey team...

484
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,020
Don't compare me to Li Yubing!

485
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,140
Yu Yan!

486
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,070
What's wrong with you?

487
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,790
- Nothing.
- Okay.

488
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,820
Stop. Take a break for a little while.

489
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,060
No, I can do it.

490
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm your coach. You have to listen to me. You can't continue on like this.

491
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,750
I said no need!

492
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,530
Is everything all right?

493
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,930
Sister Liang, you are here.

494
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,400
Xiao Jin, what's going on with Yan-yan?

495
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
He is...

496
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,320
Come in.

497
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,220
Have a seat.

498
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,370
Senior, it's like this.

499
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,370
Yu Yan has not been in good condition these days.

500
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,760
Why not let him take some time off?

501
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,420
Why?

502
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,620
Because he...

503
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,650
he's too tired.

504
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,870
He is tired? Compared to when we were athletes,

505
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,520
these kids should consider themselves lucky.

506
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,960
Besides, he's going to participate in the National Championship soon.

507
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,260
How can he take a break right now?

508
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,080
Senior, times are different now.

509
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,980
We didn't have the conditions back then and there wasn't a good system for training.

510
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,810
Now there's scientific training with systematic planning. You can't force it on him.

511
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,770
Don't force it. Then let him be free?

512
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,600
Kids now don't have self-discipline.

513
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,840
If not forced, they won't practice on their own.

514
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,450
Think of what we went through. The coach was also forcing us every day.

515
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,060
Besides, tough teachers make excellent students.

516
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,970
As long as he performs well.

517
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,060
Xiao Jin, tell me.

518
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,440
I don't mind how much you yell at him.

519
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,620
It's really not like this.

520
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,280
Look at this.

521
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,840
I'm afraid something might happen.

522
