It's such a pity!

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,700
Yang Liping from the Street Dance Club just texted me

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,440
saying he'll dance for my performance, so I won't need your help this time.

Your goddess obviously doesn't like you.

If you weren't Li Yubing's roommate, she wouldn't even talk to you.

If I'm used by my goddess, it means I'm at least worthy of being used.

Do you guys think Master Tang will be able to get an award at the competition?

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
This is a complicated question.

40
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,540
According to the logic of problem-solving, any complicated problem

41
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,680
becomes very simple if we break the problem down.

42

Geniuses are geniuses.

43
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,210
If Tang Xue wants to get the Most Popular Award,

44
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,690
her biggest competitor is Zhou Ran.

45
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,560
Zhou Ran? She's competing, too?

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,230
The world is so small.
(T/N: lit. enemies are bound to meet on a narrow path)

47
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,370
We have good news: Zhou Ran's singing ability is also nothing special.

48
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,020
- Really?
- But the bad news is, she still sings better than Tang Xue does.

49
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,180
So, because she doesn't have any special singing ability,

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,900
she must be going for the Most Popular Award.

51
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,970
It's okay. We have Li Yubing and Yu Yan. They're so popular, we'll be fine.

52
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,680
But Zhou Ran has Yang Liping dancing for her.

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,220
Who? Yang Liping?

54
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,160
The Li from win, and the ping from peace. Yang Liping from LUU Street Dance Club.

55

Wow. Even his name is impressive.

56

I know who Yang Liping is. The star of LUU Street Dance Club.

57
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,320
With Zhou Ran and Yang Liping together, their popularity is no joke.

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,700
Then, does Master Tang still have a chance of winning?

59
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,170
Humans do the work, and God determines the outcome.

Now, the most important thing

61

is to see what God decides.

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,400
Bro.

156
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,000
This is a public area, be quiet.

157
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,400
Everyone is happily watching the competition.

158
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Most of the people here are for Li Yubing and Yu Yan. Don't mess up the mood.

159
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,700
Bian Cheng, why are you here?

160
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,600
We have a high school reunion tonight.

161
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
It's not far from LUU, so I dropped by.

162
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Really? Zhou Ran is performing today.

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,100
You're so thoughtful.

164
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,200
You're misunderstanding. Zhou Ran and I are just high school classmates.

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
- Let's chat later.
- Okay.

166
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,200
He came so early.

167
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,200
He definitely didn't just "drop by."

168
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,400
He didn't come for Zhou Ran, could it be for Master Tang?

169
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,500
My god, he can't possibly have some kind of intention for Master Tang again, could he?

170
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,700
Xiao Liao,

171
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,400
cotton balls for plugging your ears.

172
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,400
Huan-huan, you're so considerate.

173
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
For you to plug your ears. You know what I mean.

174
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
No, there's already a Yu Yan.

175
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Adding another Bian Cheng to mess up the plan,

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,200
then when will Li Yubing ever get with Master Tang?

177
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,500
For my Huan-huan, I need to think of an idea on how to assist Li Yubing.

178
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,500
Walking with the rustling of the autumn wind, we enter the hall of harvest.

179
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,700
We listen to the happy wind chimes, together we look for the dreams of youth.

180
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,200
Youth is like the music note that always vibrates.

181
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,600
Youth is the years when passion ignites.

182
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,700
Come. Let us let go of youth and

183
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,900
experience youth and dreams.

184
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,400
Lincheng Union University First Song of Youth,

185
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,880
Lincheng Union University Campus Singing Competition,

186
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,000
officially begins!

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,200
Let's welcome our first contestant, Han Xiao.

188
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Hold up your light sticks!

189
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,100
♫ I told my mom one day I’ll be rich ♫

190
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,900
♫ Difficulties are temporary and I left my hometown ♫

191
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,000
♫ The flight at midnight, just to prove my worth ♫

192
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,700
♫ In the crowded economy class, holding onto
the luggage I can’t put down ♫

193
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,450
♫ The unconforming animal came to the big city ♫

194
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,700
♫ I feel more like a frog at the bottom of a well,
telling myself tomorrow will be better ♫

195
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,400
Tang Xue, your group is pretty powerful.

196
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,000
But the competition ultimately judges the main lead.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What do you mean?

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,900
Remember your participation is important; don't get nervous.

199
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,600
Once you get nervous, you're bound to run off-key.

200
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,500
Don't worry, I'm here. She has nowhere to run off to.

201
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Thanks.

202
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,700
Do you think we'll win a prize today?

203
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,200
We can only try our best.

204
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Hello, Yang Liping? Look at the time, why are you still not here?

205
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,400
I can't come anymore.

206
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You can't come anymore? Why is that?

207
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,800
We were planning to rehearse earlier,

208
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,300
but one of us did a cartwheel and broke the glass of the rehearsal room.

209
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,400
Right now, we're being held in the Guidance Office.

210
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
Then if all of you can't come, what am I suppose to do?

211
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,600
♫ Doesn’t matter if it’s the night or the harsh winter ♫

212
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,200
♫ Your name is twisting in my heart ♫

213
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,400
♫ As long as I have you, it is well ♫

214
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,000
♫ Living the life I want to live ♫

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,700
♫ There is a future I want to be ♫

216
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,600
♫ I'm not somebody that I want to be ♫

217
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,800
♫ Regardless of who’s right or wrong, yet still so persistent ♫

218
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,000
♫ How can you be optimistic and unconstrained if
you’re unable to let go? ♫

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
♫ Regardless of who loves who more, there are too
many regrets ♫

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
♫ There’s no outcome because love was given too undisguised ♫

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
Zhou Ran, you're up. Hurry!

222
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,400
Then, what can we do?

223
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,600
- I don't know.
- How about you go up alone?

224
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Alone? No, I can't. How can I do it alone?

225
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,700
No problem. Good Luck!

226
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,500
Good luck! Good luck!

227
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,800
♫ Everybody, vision is focused and has control of the
whole place ♫

228
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,400
♫ The oxygen is burning up, accelerate the engine,
it’s a perfect drift ♫

229
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,700
♫ Playing the wins and losses, reverse counterattack,
it was all effortless ♫

230
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,200
♫ I dictate my fate, overcome myself, this task was done easily ♫

231
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,800
♫ Watch me exert and gain momentum, I’ve already
got eyes on you ♫

232
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,200
Goddess will always be a goddess.

233
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
She really is awesome.

234
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,800
This is the difference between you and her.

235
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,000
This is the distance between you and her.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
♫ Play a game of hockey to strike you ♫

237
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,200
♫ Catch you off guard and give you an unexpected surprise ♫

238
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
It's over.

239
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,700
I think Master Tang lost without even starting.

240
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,600
What do we do?

241
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,000
♫ We are the master of the world ♫

242
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
♫ Go ♫

243
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,700
Zhao Ran you're so stunning. You'll probably win the Most Popular Award today.

244
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,600
You flatter me. I should thank you for motivating me to go on stage.

245
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
No, it's you.

246
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,200
The next contestant is the Ice and Snow group.

247
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,750
The three members of this group represent LUU's

248
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,100
three areas of On-Ice sports.

249
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,850
Short track speed skating, figure skating, and ice hockey.

250
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,200
Their song is...

251
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,300
World of Ice and Snow!

252
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,100
This is a good group: handsome guys and a pretty girl.

253
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,400
What is this girl's background? She actually brought Li Yubing and Yu Yan, two Male Gods, together.

254
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,700

Let me introduce to you, this is my girlfriend.

275
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,300
- Get out of here, she's mine.
- Who are you to say that?

276
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,600
What's this girl's name?

277
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,300
Tang Xue, my roommate.

278
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,200
Junior.

279
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Senior, why are you here?

280
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,300
Of course, I came to give you flowers.

281
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,200
Thank you, Senior.

282
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,300
There's a saying, "This sound is only heard in heaven, how many times can humans hear it?"

283
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,900
It describes your voice perfectly. I could listen to it forever.

284
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,500
It's hard to forget. Oh right.

285
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Trust me, you'll definitely get the Most Popular Award.

286
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,100
I'll count on it then.

287
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,000
So, now that the competition is over,

288
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
do you want to have dinner with me?

289
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I know of a really good music restaurant.

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,600
Dinner? But I have a classmates' reunion dinner today.

291
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,500
Classmates' reunion?

292
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,900
Then, will it run late? I can pick you up afterward.

293
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,800
Excuse me, Senior. Please don't worry. I will take care of it.

294
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,500
You're that...

295
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
The interviewer, called...

296
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,100
I'm Bian Cheng. I'm Zhou Ran's high school classmate.

297
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,700
You're as skinny as a baby chick.

298
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,200
Are you capable of protecting my Junior Zhou Ran?

299
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,100
I'll drive her back, ensuring your goddess's safety.

300
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,800
Senior, don't worry.

301
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
I won't worry about it then.

302
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,500
Then, you guys keep talking. I'll get going.

303
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,800
Bian Cheng, thanks for helping me out just now.

304
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,200
This senior is kind of hard to shake off.

305
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
You're welcome.

306
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,300
But don't blame me later. After the reunion dinner,

307
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm going to be sending Tang Xue home first.

308
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,100
I also hope that everything goes as planned for you.

309
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
You saw the performance earlier, too.

310
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,300
Tang Xue is quite popular.

311
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,000
On the left is Ice God, on the right is the Figure Skating Prince.

312
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,200
If you don't work hard, she really might not be yours.

313
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,900
Yu Yan isn't worth considering,

314
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,000
Tang Xue clearly thinks of him as a child.

315
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,300
But Li Yubing can't be underestimated.

316
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,400
It's okay, though. No one can stand between me and my goal.

317
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,700
All the contestants have finished performing.

318
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,000
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

319
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Everyone, please login to the LUU app now

320
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,400
to participate in the Campus Singing Competition voting round.

321
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,500
We will combine the votes with the judges' feedback

322
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,900
to decide this year's singing competition's

323
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,200
1st, 2nd, 3rd place, and Most Popular Award.

324
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,000
- You did great! You're singing was so good!
- That was amazing.

325
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,800
I couldn't believe it. You didn't go off-key at all!

326
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,400
I had an excellent teacher, of course, I sang well.

327
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm so happy.

328

♪ and the light overflows my heart for us to fall in love ♪

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
You have to get in the right key to be able to sing the song well.

330
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Why don't you learn it slowly? I'll teach you.

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
I'm really grateful to the two of you for helping me out.

345
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,100
I'm grateful to you, too.

346
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,500
You gave me another first in my lifetime experience.

347
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,100
How do you plan to thank me? Buy a lollipop for me?

348
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Sure, that's easy to do. I'll definitely do it.

349
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Let me see.

350
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,900
It's so mean to me, it only listens to you.

351
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
What's your problem?

352
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,900
- You're the one with a problem. I just didn't want you to be cold.
- I'm not cold at all.

353
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,400
Are you cold? I'll put it on for you.

354
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,500
- Help me out.
- Help you how?

355
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,000
Cousin.

356
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,700
Cousin, hi.

357
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,800
The three of you gave a flawless performance today.

358
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,500
What are you saying?

359
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,700
Today, even after being ditched last minute, you were still able to perform so well.

360
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I was really impressed.

361
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,100
By the way, don't be late to the reunion tonight.

362
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,700
Bian Cheng will be there tonight, too.

363
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
Wang Feng didn't mention that.

364
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,200
That's why I specially came to let you know.

365
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
See you there.

366
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,800
Tang Xue, don't force yourself.

367
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,600
It's just a classmates' reunion. If you don't go, it might look like you have a guilty conscience.

368
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,000
Cheers!

369
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,200
Tang Xue. Zhou Ran. You guys were really unfair to us today.

370
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,700
I heard that today, in the LUU Campus Singing Competition,

371
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,000
you guys each gave a stunning performance.

372
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Why didn't you invite us to come and watch?

373
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Seriously. Don't you guys agree?

374
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,200
Yeah, exactly.

375
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,000
I have to say, you two were so well-known in our class.

376
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Now that you're in college, you're still so well-known. That's not an easy feat.

377
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,500
I truly hope you guys both win awards.

378
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,100
Whether I win an award or Tang Xue does, it's all the same.

379
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,000
It's all to make our classmates proud, right?

380
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,100
That's true.

381
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,600
For today's reunion, let's first thank our class president, Wang Feng.

382
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,750
No need, it's no big deal.

383
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Next, let's thank Bian Cheng, whose generosity

384
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,900
is the reason we can eat at such a nice restaurant.

385
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,300
As long as everyone enjoys it.

386
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,000
Last, we need to thank a very important person.

387
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's Tang Xue.

388
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,000
- Me?
- Yeah.

389
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,500
If you weren't the motivating factor, how would Bian Cheng have found such a nice restaurant?

390
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,300
Isn't that right?

391
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,100
It just happened like that.

392
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,900
I saw that this place was decorated like a European castle.

393
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,000
You used to love Disney princesses, right?

394
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,600
That was so long ago.

395
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,300
Let's drink to this rare friendship.

396
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,600
Let's do it.

397
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Cheers!

398
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,850
Zhou Ran used to be the prettiest girl at Sixth Middle School.

399
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,200
Now, at LUU, she's just as popular.

400
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,400
I heard even LUU's Ice God has fallen for you.

401
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't say that. Senior Yubing and I

402
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,100
are just friends.

403
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
This steak was flown over from Australia.

404
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,200
It's also high in protein.

405
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,600
Didn't you recently start training for short track speed skating again? This is really good for you.

406
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
Try it.

407
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,600
Tang Xue, eat up.

408
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Didn't you always have a big appetite? In our first year of high school,

409
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,600
your appetite shocked the whole school.

410
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,200
Speaking of this, I just remembered. One time, during study hall,

411
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Tang Xue secretly ate instant noodles during study hall. I was so distracted I couldn't focus on studying at all.

412
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,600
Now you're so thin, and instead, I've gained weight now.

413
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
It's all your fault.

414
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,200
That's your fault for eating so much. Why are you trying to blame Master Tang?

415
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I hang out with Master Tang every day, but have I gained weight?

416
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,900
Right?

417
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,200
By the way, do you guys remember, one time during night time study hall,

418
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,600
Master Tang secretly snuck out and climbed the school gates to go buy skewers for our whole class.

419
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,500
Because of that incident,

420
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,500
our entire class voluntarily nominated Master Tang to be our class president. Isn't that right?

421
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,100
Yeah, I remember that.

422
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,340
If you put it that way,

423
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,200
actually, Tang Xue is my elder.

424
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,000
I remember once, in our equipment room,

425
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
Tang Xue broke the window.

426
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,800
So our teacher made her fix it right then and there. We were all listening to the teacher's lecture,

427
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,800
and she just banged away with that hammer for a whole afternoon until the window was fixed.

428
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,100
I remember that that happened.

429
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,000
She also stole the principal's pet rabbit.

430
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,700
That was because I saw it running around outside. I thought it'd been abandoned, so I took it home with me.

431
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,000
How did the rumor start that I stole it?

432
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,500
Tang Xue was such a tomboy back then.

433
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,900
But to our Gifted Scholar Bian,

434
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,800
she was as soft as water.

435
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,400
It's been so many years. Why are you guys all talking about me?

436
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Which one of you doesn't have a past? I'm going to call out every one of you. You.

437
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,000
You wrote her a love letter and got discovered by me.

438
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,200
Am I right?

439
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Coincidentally, I picked it up...

440
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,600
You forgot to do your homework that one time, and

441
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,500
got caught copying someone else's by the teacher. Who helped you then?

442
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,590
There are so many sides of you that I didn't get to see.

443
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,080
Son, are you sure you want to go to First Middle School

444
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,340
and not Sixth Middle School?

445
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,720
I heard all your classmates want to go to Sixth Middle School.

446
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,060
I don't want to go to Sixth Middle School. I want to go to First Middle School.

447
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,410
Okay, we'll listen to you.

448
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,960
There's no way I'm going to the same middle school as Tang Xue.

449
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,700
♫ That year’s winter, our foolish smiles were so sweet ♫

450
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,640
♫ The wishing bottle is waiting for the spring rain, ♫

451
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,880
That year, that one decision resulted in 6 lost years.

452
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:27,100
♫ Next winter, next journey, we’ll wait for the snow to fall ♫

453
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,580
I'll get going now. Let's get together again next time.

454
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,530
We'll get together again sometime. Bye-bye.

455
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,420
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

456
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,350
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

457
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,810
Hold on a second.

458
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,170
Huan-huan, what's up?

459
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,290
Wait for me, I'll be right there.

460
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,350
- I'm sorry, Master Tang.
- I know, I know.

461
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,370
- Love over friendship. Bye.
- No, I–

462
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,320
- Be careful on your way back!

I purposely played the villain so you could play the hero and get closer to her.

How could you still let someone else intercept?

Having to fight for something shows how valuable it is.

You're Li Yubing's rumored girlfriend according to the news.

If you just work a little harder, you can become his actual girlfriend.

Do you think I'm putting too much effort into this?

484

You get more of a chance with the person you like, and I get to deal with one less rival. We both win here.

It's not that.

Who's so lacking in civic responsibility that they left these rotten eggs here?

515
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,000
- What are you laughing at?
- No, I'm just thinking about when you were younger,

516
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,930
you held onto a chicken egg for a whole week, determined to hatch it.

517
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,470
You said that you were its mom and I was its dad.

I remember now! Egg's Dad!

519
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,830
What happened to that egg afterward?

520
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,440
It didn't have an "afterward."

521
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,890
At that time, Zhou Ran lied to me and said that baby chicks are very fragile.

522
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,390
So it wouldn't be able to break out of the shell by itself.

523
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,180
She convinced me to break the egg.

524
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,870
From then on, I started to hate her. Because the thing I hate the most is when people lie to me.

If you knew that I hadn't told you the truth, would you hate me, too?

Do you think he should keep it from her?

In this world, all things are revealed eventually.
