[Episode 27]

18
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,420
Zhou Yajuan!

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,920
What's going on, raising your voice like that?

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
Did you know that Xiao Xue started short track speed skating training again?

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,290
- I... I knew.
- What?

22
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,710
- I wanted to tell you earlier when we were eating.
- Enough!

23
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,750
I, Tang Hongjiang, don't even have the right to know in this family?!

24
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,990
You knew; Zhou Ran knew; everyone knew!

25
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,590
Where are you going?

26
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,440
Where am I going? To LUU!

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,480
Liao Zhenyu.

28
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,670
- Uncle. Auntie. What are you doing here?
- Is Tang Xue in there?

29
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,240
She is in... class.

30
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,870
Auntie Tang. Uncle Tang. Hello!

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,080
Is Tang Xue in there?

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,240
She...

33
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,640
is sick. She's resting in the dorm.

34
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,340
I got it all mixed up. She has a fever.

35
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,570
Take me to her dorm.

36
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,400
Talk nicely. You are scaring the kids.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,950
She's not in class or the dorm, nor is she sick.

38
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,830
Isn't that right?

39
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,060
Take a good look at this.

40
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,160
She transferred departments, didn't she?

41
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,290
Uncle...

42
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,750
She didn't deliberately keep it from you. Maybe she has other plans.

43
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,020
No matter what plans she has, she can't switch majors without letting us know.

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,870
Is this something trivial?

45
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,830
Liao Zhenyu, let me ask you again. Where is she?

46
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,430
She's in the sports center.

47
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,410
Take me to her.

48
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,220
- Listen to me...
- I've listened to you my whole life.

49
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,430
Today, I won't be listening to you.

50
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,430
- Let's go.
- This way.

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,060
Uncle Tang, listen to me...

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,600
She only did this because she was afraid you'd object, and she's realized that

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,490
speed skating is her real dream. That's why she did this.

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,100
She's given up a lot.

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,900
- Besides, after switching majors, she didn't neglect her studies, she's still very diligent in her classes.
- Exactly.

56
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,430
She also said you were her biggest supporter when she did speed skating as a child. Wasn't that so, Uncle?

57
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,020
Uncle, please don't be mad anymore.

58
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,140
It really wasn't easy for Master Tang to join the speed skating team.

59
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,900
Say, without the ¥50,000 from Li Yubing, she wouldn't have made it in even if she wanted. Right?

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,930
- So–
- What? She casually took other's money?

61
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,030
¥50,000?!
(about $7,055)

62
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,270
- Did you know?
- Are you an idiot?

63
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,810
- I just wanted to help.
- This isn't helping!

64
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,880
Take me to see her immediately!

65
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,940
The opening for the last Olympic City Cup was quite successful.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,800
They want to host a couple of offline hockey promotional events targeting children.

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,700
They want to invite you.

68
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,660
I think it's a good opportunity; beneficial to you, the club, and the Olympic City Cup.

69
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,520
Yubing, what do you think?

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,410
I like it. It can promote ice hockey.

71
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,520
As long as it doesn't conflict with game time. I'm willing.

72
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,060
Don't worry. I'll definitely arrange it well, my little ancestor.

73
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,710
- Hello?
- Where are you? Come to the rink!

74
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,110
- Something happened to Tang Xue!
- What happened? Did she get hurt?

75
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,070
I called her but she didn't pick up. Come over now! Bye-bye.

76
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,860
Hurry up.

77
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,100
Today, we practice how to start.

78
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,150
The quality of the start decides the result of a match.

79
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,230
- Especially you, Tang Xue.
- Understood.

80
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,430
Get ready.

81
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,450
- Tang Xue, be steady.
- Don't be so impulsive.

82
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,120
Get up and we'll do it again.

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,840
Ready?

84
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,440
- You've grown up, right? You can make your own decisions?!
- Enough.

85
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,130
Let's talk outside.

86
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,700
Transferring departments is such a big matter, why didn't you discuss it with us?

87
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,230
Do you even care about us?

88
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,830
I wanted to.

89
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,240
But I was afraid that you'd object and worry.

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,650
- So...
- So what?

91
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,600
How old are you?

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,760
What can you achieve on this path?

93
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
No matter how well you skate,

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,150
can you make the national team? Can you win?

95
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,840
Tang Xue, you are too willful and rash!

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,920
Dad, I am willful,

97
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,380
but I am not being rash.

98
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,970
I am very clear about what my goal is and what I am pursuing.

99
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,740
Of course, you know what you are pursing!

100
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,920
That hockey player!

101
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,280
Do you think I don't know what happened during winter break?

102
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,110
What you did is just completely inappropriate!

103
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,720
Tang Hongjiang, that's enough!

104
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,070
Can't I control you anymore?

105
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,350
You are on her team. Don't interrupt me.

106
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,980
Dad,

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,970
do you think

108
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,480
I really am a girl

109
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,270
who is not sensible, doesn't know how to reflect, or make judgments?

110
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,880
I don't even know what is appropriate?

111
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,010
Do you think that after all these years, this is the daughter you raised?

112
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
I don't care what others think that I can't do it.

113
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Why do you think so as well?

114
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,490
Enough. Go back with me.

115
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,850
We'll discuss what happens next.

116
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,740
You can't touch short-track speed skating ever again!

117
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,050
- Then I won't study anymore either!
- You're being disobedient!
- Enough!

118
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,690
- What are you doing?
- Tang Xue's Mom and Dad!

119
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,460
Tang Xue's Mom and Dad, please calm down first.

120
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,030
Calm down.

121
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,140
I'm the short track speed skating team's coach, Chu Xia.

122
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,680
I want to clarify something about Tang Xue's situation.

123
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,360
Let's go to my office and have a chat.

124
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,270
Okay.

125
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,810
- Xiao Li, continue training with them.
- Okay.

126
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,750
Let's get back to training. Yuwei leads this group. Come on. Get ready.

127
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,600
This way.

128
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,970
This is Xiao Xue's training records from when she started till now.

129
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,740
Please take a look.

130
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,460
Take a look.

131
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,980
I don't think Tang Xue is a willful and rash child.

132
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,310
Quite the opposite. She clearly knows what her dream is.

133
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,500
And she's willing to give her best for it.

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,270
After she joined our team, she's improved significantly.

135
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,940
She is an athlete that has great potential.

136
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,530
We'll participate in the National University Championship.

137
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,010
I want to give her an opportunity to prove herself.

138
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,810
During this time, she especially needs her parents' support and understanding.

139
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,770
Coach Chu,

140
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,400
as parents, we don't want to become the one killing her dreams.

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,090
However... the scene when she got hurt,

142
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,970
even until now...

143
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,440
That scene,

144
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,120
I don't ever want to witness it again.

145
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,620
Coach Chu,

146
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,960
you know sports better than me.

147
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,080
In this field,

148
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,740
there are plenty of teenagers

149
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,440
who are excellent enough to join the national team.

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,770
Right?

151
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,190
Tang Xue...

152
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,320
First, she doesn't have an edge in her age.

153
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,990
And she was in recovery for over a year due to her injury.

154
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,750
Now she's training again.

155
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,510
Not to mention a breakthrough.

156
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,150
It'll be extremely difficult to

157
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,880
even be on the same level as before.

158
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,640
I understand completely.

159
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,690
I was an athlete, too.

160
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,950
I can also understand Tang Xue.

161
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,840
For her, some things are more important than her life.

162
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,400
As her parents, don't you want her to be happy?

163
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,270
Happy? Of course, we do.

164
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,800
We want her to live a happy life.

165
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,570
If she chooses speed skating,

166
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,570
after all the training and competitions, she doesn't get what she wants,

167
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,150
would she be able to accept the defeat? Would she?

168
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,020
How many champions are there?

169
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,280
Many work so hard for a championship

170
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,180
and they end up with nothing.

171
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,130
How many people can choose a profession they like?

172
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,400
They all survived.

173
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,030
As parents, we only hope that

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,760
she doesn't take detours or take fewer detours.
(T/N: going the wrong way)

175
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,570
That's true. Champions are limited.

176
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,270
We athletes are not always champions.

177
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,460
It doesn't hurt the feeling of happiness when we are doing these things.

178
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:42,320
Maybe short track speed skating to Tang Xue is an impulsive decision.

179
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,530
If so, she'll regret it for some time.

180
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,020
However, if she never tries or works for it,

181
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,720
she'll regret it for the rest of her life.

182
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,200
- I–
- Old Tang, I think the coach is right.

183
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,220
When I knew she went back to speed skating,

184
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,590
I was torn as well.

185
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,410
But... she's a grown-up now.

186
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,950
Isn't it time for us to learn to let go?

187
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,250
I remember you always took her to train for speed skating when she was little.

188
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,140
At that time, you would come back and tell me, the hobby Xue chose was great.

189
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,440
Look how happy she is on the ice.

190
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,020
Why can't you think it through now?

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,100
- I–
- I'd rather worry than have her be unhappy.

192
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,110
As her coach,

193
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,670
I truly believe she's very talented.

194
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,170
If you really want her to give up,

195
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,300
at least let's see how she does in the upcoming competition and then decide.

196
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,960
Is that okay?

197
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,110
Sorry, Coach. He can't turn his head around yet.

198
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,600
We'll discuss it more at home.

199
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,040
Thank you for your help at this time.

200
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,100
Thanks.

201
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,470
- Then we'll get going.
- Okay.

202
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,240
Sorry.

203
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,720
I only cared about what I like or not.

204
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,610
I never thought about your feelings. I was wrong.

205
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,980
But there are still things I want to say.

206
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,560
I didn't choose speed skating because of impulsivity.

207
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,930
I chose to gamble.

208
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,770
A gamble where neither time or age

209
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,290
is my advantage.

210
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,870
Since I'm now standing by the wheel of fate,

211
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,990
please give me a chance.

212
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,580
If I win,

213
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,980
it means that without any advantages,

214
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,370
I'm destined to be an athlete.

215
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,950
If I lose,

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
I'll accept it and give up immediately.

217
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,400
♫ Is she better or worse? ♫

218
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,280
Okay.

219
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,230
This is your last chance.

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,980
♫ I once ruined all that I had just wanting to leave forever ♫

221
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,750
♫ I once fell into bottomless darkness, wanting to struggle yet unable to free myself ♫

222
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:57,350
♫ I once was like you, like him, like that wild grass and flower ♫

223
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,990
This is the money you lent her. I've deposited it on this card.

224
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,350
The password is the last 6 digits of your cell. Take it.

225
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,390
Thank you.

226
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,160
The old saying is correct.

227
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,330
One depends on parents at home and on friends like you when leaving home.

228
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,560
Thank you.

229
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,370
Auntie. Uncle.

230
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,580
She's paid some back already.

231
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,660
Paid back?

232
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,150
Xue'er, how did you pay it back?

233
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,120
- I saved some every month from my living expenses.
- You–

234
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,050
I know I have to pay for my own training fee. I'm not that stupid.

235
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,550
You child! Do you not care about your health?

236
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,090
Auntie. Uncle.

237
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,800
In the past, I decided on my own to pay for her training fees.

238
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,930
She didn't know about it in the beginning.

239
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,970
But she stayed on the team because of her own skills and Coach Chu acknowledged it.

240
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,490
It has nothing to do with the training fee.

241
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,020
Well,

242
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,880
I want to talk to Li Yubing in private.

243
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,890
Dad.

244
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,210
Okay, that's fine. Xue'er,

245
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,810
show me around your school.

246
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,800
You two carry on.

247
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,470
Let's go. Hurry.

248
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,740
Let's go.

249
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,160
Your campus is quite big.

250
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,090
There's even a lake.

251
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,600
Mom,

252
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,900
what does Dad want to say to Li Yubing?

253
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,090
No matter what it is. He has to speak his mind so things get resolved.

254
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,020
Daughter, I've raised you like a cabbage for almost 20 years.

255
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,730
A dog is about to carry you away. Can't we say anything?

256
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,730
You can't raise a cabbage for 20 years. Besides, he's not a dog.

257
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,300
He is not?

258
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,650
I wonder who it is that every time Li Yubing is mentioned at home, it was always "dog, dog."

259
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,720
It's my exclusive right.

260
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,040
Fine, a woman of age can't be kept from marriage. What a true saying.

261
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,400
Let's check on them.

262
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,900
No need to. Why do you need to go back? Would your dad eat him alive?

263
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,740
How did Dad know anyway?

264
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,740
I have never liked the idea of

265
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,560
Tang Xue and you dating.

266
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,120
It was this in the past, it still is right now.

267
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,760
I didn't like it in the past because you lied to her.

268
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,450
I don't like it now because of your choice of profession.

269
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,070
I asked around and know that you've signed a contract with XDragons.

270
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,410
You're bound to compete in professional competitions in the future.

271
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,090
I don't need to talk about the danger in competition,

272
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,530
you know it better than me.

273
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,020
Xiao Xue is normally a careless girl.

274
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,590
But I know her.

275
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,100
She has the softest heart.

276
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,780
If you get hurt in a game

277
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,960
and it was a serious injury, then to her,

278
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,280
it'll be a heavy blow.

279
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,590
Being worried and fearing to lose the most important person, I've already experienced this kind of suffering.

280
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,340
I don't want to experience it again.

281
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,780
I also don't want her

282
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,190
to experience it.

283
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,640
You'll only truly understand my current feelings when you become a father.

284
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,260
I understand. My mom is also afraid to watch my games.

285
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,560
As you said,

286
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,480
she fears that I'll get hurt,

287
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,960
but she continues to support me in hockey

288
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,600
only because I love it.

289
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,290
I have a group of great teammates, great brothers.

290
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,860
We trust and help each other.

291
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,870
We try to win every game.

292
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,080
♫ Pacing back and forth on the road ♫

293
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,820
♫ Are you leaving? Via Via ♫

294
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,460
♫ Fragile and proud ♫

295
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,030
♫ That was how I used to be ♫

296
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,370
To us, hockey

297
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,000
is a dream that we all

298
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,030
protect and fight for, for the rest of our lives.

299
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,150
I understand there are collisions and injuries in a game.

300
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,840
More than that, hockey brings us responsibility,

301
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,590
the courage to face difficulties, and the athletic spirit of never giving up.

302
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,650
If I give up hockey because I'm afraid of injuries,

303
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,150
I'll always be the 12-year old boy

304
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,830
who couldn't keep a promise and ran away in the face of problems.

305
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,610
Yes.

306
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,100
I admit that you are doing well right now.

307
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,500
What about in 5 or 10 years?

308
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,810
In his 20s, an average person just stepped into society.

309
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,270
But it's perhaps already the end for an athlete.

310
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,310
I also don't know how far I'll go.

311
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,040
But I know that we need people like me to keep fighting so that China can become strong in hockey.

312
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,850
Sooner or later, someone like Xu Feng will appear among us.

313
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,600
An athlete who is active in international competitions.

314
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,650
To tell the world,

315
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
us Chinese are also good at ice hockey.

316
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,280
♫ I once crossed over the mountain and sea,
also passing through the vast crowd ♫

317
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,320
Xue'er, work hard. We are waiting for your good news.

318
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,680
Li Yubing, good luck to you as well.

319
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,780
Thank you, Auntie. I will.

320
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,170
Dad, do you have anything to say?

321
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,480
I hope you don't win.

322
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,300
Then you'll give up.

323
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,800
What are you talking about?

324
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,160
Of course, if you do win,

325
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,600
you should keep training.

326
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Xue'er, don't hurt yourself. We are old.

327
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
We can't take it anymore.

328
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,800
Thank you, Dad.

329
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Don't worry. I'll definitely take good care of myself.

330
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,500
Okay, okay.

331
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,600
- Let's go. Don't let him wait too long.
- Okay.

332
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
You two go back.

333
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,200
- All right, let's go already. We are out of time.
- Okay.

334
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,000
Go back.

335
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Bye-bye. See you.

336
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
See you.

337
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Finally, my dad gave me his permission.

338
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,000
But him coming here really was too sudden.

339
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,800
I was not ready at all.

340
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
How did he know?

341
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
My mom said he saw it in Bian Cheng's Wechat Moment.

342
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Then...

343
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
he found out.

344
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,100
Show me.

345
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,000
That's weird.

346
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,900
These pictures were not published recently, they're from last semester.

347
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,300
Why is he posting them now?

348
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,000
What do you mean?

349
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Is it possible that he did it on purpose?

350
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't think Bian Cheng would go that far.

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,200
You trust him this much?

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,900
Because he didn't know that I hid it from my family.

353
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Only Zhou Ran knew. My mom said she found out from her.

354
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Really? I just don't think this is a coincidence.

355
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,600
Why don't I go ask Zhou Ran?

356
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,860
No.

357
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,900
That's like giving Tang Seng to the monsters.
(T/N: Tang Seng is the monk from Journey to the West)

358
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,500
Bajie, you were the one that arranged for her to send me breakfast back then.
(T/N: Bajie is the pig-like character in Journey to the West)

359
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
Your last name wasn't Tang yet.

360
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
When did I change my last name to Tang?

361
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,100
- Right now.
- Right now?

362
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Turns out, Tang Xue got her temperament from her dad.

363
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,800
Mind your own business.

364
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
So, what's his decision in the end?

365
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,500
He said it depends on her results for the upcoming championship competition.

366
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,100
If she doesn't do well, she'll have to give up.

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,300
What? Give up short track speed skating?

368
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,000
It's an ultimatum. Are you confident?

369
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,200
No.

370
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
I didn't know what I was thinking. I just...

371
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,100
I felt bad seeing them like that and my brain just went blank.

372
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,800
I felt an urge and said those words.

373
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,600
This is the power of family ties.

374
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,000
I know my dad doesn't want me to skate at all.

375
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Parents never win the war against their children.

376
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Tang Xue, good luck!

377
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,300
I really... am not worried about myself right now.

378
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,200
I only worry about Li Yubing.

379
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,800
You didn't see how my dad looked at him today.

380
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,000
It seemed like killing him a thousand times wasn't even enough.

381
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
That intense?

382
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,000
Hello.

383
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,600
Tang Xue, I'm really sorry.

384
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,000
I heard that your dad went to your school.

385
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,300
I didn't know my posts would make him so angry.

386
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,200
I didn't know he objected to your training for speed skating.

387
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
You didn't do it on purpose. It's okay.

388
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,600
He'll be fine in a few days.

389
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
Are you okay?

390
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,600
I felt too guilty to call you.

391
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,600
I didn't know how to explain myself.

392
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,400
How about I gift you a pair of customized skates, as my apology?

393
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
Don't. They are too expensive.

394
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,600
You must still be angry.

395
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,700
I'm really not.

396
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,000
Then at least let me treat you to a meal? Otherwise, I'll feel really bad.

397
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,200
Okay then.

398
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,000
Enjoy.

399
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,900
My aunt called me.

400
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,300
Your post was such a heavyweight bomb.

401
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Especially when my uncle found out that

402
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,000
Li Yubing paid for Tang Xue's training fee.

403
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Now it's even more certain, without Li Yubing,

404
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,200
Tang Xue would have never started training again.

405
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,000
This is simply a barrier for them.

406
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,900
Nothing special.

407
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,800
Are you not worried that Tang Xue will blame you?

408
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,800
All I did was post a set of research photos.

409
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,000
I didn't make anything up. Why would she blame me?

410
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Exposing her secret so publicly,

411
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,400
what a good move.

412
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,600
Without your help, I wouldn't have succeeded.

413
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,700
That girl needs to suffer a bit. Who told her to take away my Ice God?

414
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,500
Now she has plenty to worry about.

415
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Actually, I didn't want to do this either.

416
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,200
You don't know how much her dad hates her skating.

417
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,400
With my uncle's temper, she probably got an earful this time.

418
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,400
If she can't perform well next time,

419
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,000
is she really going to give up?

420
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,700
She must be...

421
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,200
Zhou Ran, did you notice that you keep talking about Tang Xue?

422
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,900
Do I?

423
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,400
It doesn't look like you care about Li Yubing.

424
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,500
Do you really like him?

425
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Of course, I do.

426
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,600
Do you regret what you did, now that she's upset?

427
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,900
It was never my goal to have her scolded.

428
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,600
I want her dad to step out

429
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,200
and object to Tang Xue and Li Yubing dating.

430
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,800
That's what I want.

431
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay.

432
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,300
Then tell me. What are you doing next?

433
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,600
These tactics are just external forces to them.

434
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,300
Most importantly is what he personally thinks.

435
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,100
So we need to work on them personally.

436
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,400
I still have to participate in the University Student News Selection event.

437
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,500
I need to get home to prepare. Why don't we leave now?

438
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,200
Okay.

439
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,800
Are you there? I heard a secret today.

440
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,600
I don't know if I should tell.

441
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,200
A secret kept is a loyal servant.

442
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,400
A secret told is a culprit.

443
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,400
If it's a secret about hurting others,

444
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
should I still keep it?

445
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
Everyone involved is

446
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,200
either a collaborator or a conspirator.

447
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,000
If latter, follow your heart.

448
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,200
Push.

449
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,100
Bing-bing.

450
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,800
- Push. Rest.
- Bing-bing.

451
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,500
How rare. Why are you so diligent today, Fatty?

452
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,000
I have something to tell Bing-bing.

453
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm telling you...

454
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
I know why Tang Xue's dad came all of a sudden.

455
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,800
Dirty tricks. These two are unscrupulous.

456
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I didn't expect my goddess to behave this way. I'm not her fan anymore.

457
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,900
But I'm afraid they have more tricks.

458
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,300
I won't give them that chance.

459
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,200
[School of Journalism]

460
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,000
Hello, Professor Li.

461
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,600
I signed up for the News Selection event.

462
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,200
These are some topics I prepared. Can you please take a look at them for me?

463
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,300
Okay.

464
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,700
These are all good topics. We'll discuss it more after the meeting.

465
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,200
Okay. Thank you, Professor Li!

466
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Ready? 3, 2, 1, begin.

467
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,050
Welcome to the "Three Hundred Million People on Snow and Ice" Program.

468
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,790
Today, we are honored to have

469
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,440
- Director Zhou from the Provincial Sports Commission.
- Hello.

470
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,810
First, Director Zhou, after successfully bidding for the Winter Olympics,

471
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,220
China proposed the campaign, "Three Hundred Million People on Snow and Ice."

472
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,780
Ice Hockey is a part of it.

473
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,230
Unfortunately, compared to other ice sports,

474
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,450
ice hockey doesn't receive as much attention.

475
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,410
What do you think of that?

476
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,370
Actually, our country has been greatly promoting

477
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,160
the development of ice hockey.

478
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,010
Now many universities and colleges

479
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,910
are modeling after school-run enterprise collaboration, bringing in investments.

480
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:21,030
It facilitates the promotion of ice hockey

481
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,870
and the nurturing of talents.

482
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,050
It's great. Student Bian Cheng, I saw one of your reports before.

483
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,920
It was about the enterprise collaboration between

484
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,550
LUU and XDragons. It was very good.

485
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,130
Today, you should be the one talking about it.

486
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,160
Director Zhou, you are too humble.

487
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,360
Then I'll give a brief introduction to

488
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,890
the first school-run enterprise collaboration,

489
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,540
the LUU XDragons Team. In the last season,

490
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,940
they integrated resources from both the university and the club.

491
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,870
Not only have they done well in the league,

492
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,020
but set a great example.

493
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,530
I've learned that before this season,

494
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,020
Zhen Group invested in Lincheng's Black Scorpion Team.

495
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,520
It's the second school-run enterprise collaboration after XDragons.

496
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,950
I believe this model

497
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,570
will be further adopted in China moving forward.

498
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,590
There will be more teams.

499
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,640
And we'll conduct more deep investigations

500
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,630
to follow the status and development of

501
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,930
the domestic ice hockey scene.

502
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,600
Bian Cheng.

503
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,600
Classmate, we are recording. Please leave.

504
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,470
I need to talk to you.

505
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,470
Director Zhou, let's rest for five minutes and then continue?

506
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,260
Okay.

507
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,860
- Go ahead.
- Stop playing tricks.

508
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,970
I don't understand what you're saying.

509
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,290
"It was not my goal to have Tang Xue scolded."

510
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,120
"Uncle Tang stepping out to object Tang Xue and Li Yubing dating

511
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,790
is the result I want."

512
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,370
Did you say these?

513
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,560
You also discussed it with Zhou Ran yesterday.

514
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,090
What?

515
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,940
If you're a man, then be frank.

516
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,920
I did say it. But I did it for Tang Xue's good.

517
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,640
As her dad said,

518
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,010
Tang Xue is no longer a good candidate for speed skating anymore.

519
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,190
She's too obsessed.

520
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,610
Giving up is her best choice.

521
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,560
It's her choice. There's no need for you or Uncle Tang to make it for her.

522
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,800
To be frank, didn't you pay her training fee

523
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,120
to keep her?

524
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,320
Weren't you selfish? Weren't you deciding for her?

525
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,060
We are the same.

526
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,830
Working on our own goals.

527
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,710
Do you think everyone is the same as you?

528
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,270
Let me tell you. Not everyone is as selfish as you.

529
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,890
I won't allow Tang Xue to be with you.

530
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,250
I understand Tang Xue's personality very well.

531
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,890
What I did won't affect her dreams.

532
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,010
I did it to let her dad realize that

533
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,720
how wrong you are for her.

534
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,260
Just as her dad believes, as long as you keep playing hockey,

535
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,070
injuries are the Sword of Damocles for you.

536
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,610
Do you understand? A sword that is above your head.

537
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,350
- What's going on?
 - As soon as it falls, Tang Xue will be implicated.

538
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,100
I am the one who can provide her with

539
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,350
security and a happy future.

540
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,230
Li Yubing, too bad for you.

541
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,380
You insisted on standing in front of my goal.

542
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,340
I didn't keep you two from dating in the past,

543
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,720
but I can separate you.

544
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,890
Why are you so confident?

545
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,640
In Uncle Tang's mind, I'm an accomplished journalism student at MU.

546
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,690
I'll be a writer and my future is bright and secure.

547
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,780
You are just an ice hockey player.

548
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,920
It's combative and risky.

549
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,620
He'd have to worry all the time.

550
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,770
No matter how much she likes you now,

551
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,860
she has to consider her future.

552
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,450
I can wait.

553
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,680
One year, two years, five years.

554
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,280
Let's see who'll have the last laugh.

555
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,240
Li Yubing.

556
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,570
Tang Xue?

557
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,040
How could you be this kind of person?

558
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,470
I worried that you'd feel guilty.

559
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,610
I came to have a meal with you.

560
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,890
Bian Cheng, I'm telling you. Even if there's no Li Yubing, I still won't be with you.

561
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,850
I won't dare to.

562
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,680
Why did you take me outside?

563
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,350
I'm telling you! He needs a good beating.

564
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,410
He and Zhou Ran planned all this.

565
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,830
Zhou Ran told your dad everything.

566
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,090
Zhou Ran?

567
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,120
Excuse me, everyone. You've waited long.

568
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,190
We can continue.

569
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,990
Someone else will host the interview today.

570
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,260
Thank you for participating.

571
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,060
Why?

572
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,030
Student Bian Cheng, do you know what the most important characteristics of a journalist are?

573
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,780
I've left comments on your topics.

574
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,080
I hope you can do it.

575
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
[Righteousness]

576
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,720
[Righteousness]

577
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,690
[Zhou Ran]

578
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,470
Did Li Yubing talk to you?

579
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,410
He ruined my interview.

580
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,370
Did someone hear our conversation?

581
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:00,110
That's not important. I think we don't need to see each other any longer.

582
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,910
I can't help you.

583
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,380
I know it's hard to swallow,

584
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,550
but you won't fall down. Right?

585
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,320
Do you think you know me well?

586
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,260
No need to console me.

587
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,330
Bian Cheng.

588
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,870
Have you given up?

589
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,460
I'll figure it out myself. You can't help me anyway.

590
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,950
You won't be able to get Li Yubing.

591
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,080
Why are you so sure?

592
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,900
You don't like him at all.

593
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,400
You simply want to beat Tang Xue.

594
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
You are jealous of her.

595
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,640
Do you really like her?

596
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,190
She's only one of your many goals, isn't she?

597
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,030
Because I like her, she's one of my goals.

598
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,960
When you like someone, don't you want her to be happy?

599
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,280
Between your goal and her happiness,

600
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,710
which one will you choose?

601
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,920
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫
