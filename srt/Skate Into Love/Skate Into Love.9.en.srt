17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
[Episode 9]

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,000
The younger Li Yubing, who was scared of bugs

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,900
and thugs is all grown up.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
I watched the game today.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Actually, both of the teams' abilities were similar.

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,800
XDragons could win, it's completely because you were brave enough.

23
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,960
But many people don't understand that braveness is very precious.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,310
You already became a better version of yourself.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,000
Actually, you also have credit for my change.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,900
I learned my braveness from you.

27
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,600
Then after you get into the national team and go to the Olympics,

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,700
don't ever forget I worked as an assistant to you.

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Actually, Tang Xue, you've changed as well.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,600
How did I change?

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
You also became a better version of yourself.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Even praising someone is so insincere. You are copying me.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,000
So, do you still want to skate?

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Of course.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,600
But I know...

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,000
short track speed skating to me is as far away as the stars now.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
What's wrong?

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,700
I'm just not resigned to it.

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,700
If we went to the same middle school,

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,200
what would it be like right now?

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,500
If...

42
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,480
I can start over again...

43
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,470
It's getting late. Let's go back and rest.

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
Let's go.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,700
What are you doing?

46
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,100
My computer is broken. I'm borrowing yours to edit an official photo.

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,300
I watched the game today. Actually, both of the teams' abilities were similar.

48
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,200
XDragons could win, it's completely because you were brave enough.

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Why would you secretly like him?

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,300
I also don't know.

51
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,000
Perhaps everyone will have someone like that during that time.

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,000
Then, do you still like him right now?

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Some feelings cannot be generalized by like or dislike.

54
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Because that was my entire youth.

55
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
How much do you like him?

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Liking him to the point

57
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,700
when I dreamed of getting into the same university as him every day.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,600
You've fallen for her?

59
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,400
I haven't.

60
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I just feel uneasy when I heard her say those things.

61
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,000
You can't fool me, you've changed.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,700
I haven't!

63
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,300
Bing-bing! I know I don't want to disturb you,

64
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,900
but you shouldn't make my official photo look like E.T.!

65
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,900
Huan-huan, look. I got you something tasty!

66
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,200
It's almost lunchtime. Are you still going to eat later?

67
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Eat. I'm just afraid Huan-huan will ould be hungry so this is just a snack.

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
You're so thin, you need to eat more.

69
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I got a family bucket.

70
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
No, I don't want to eat.

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
He already brought it.

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
- Just eat a bit. What are you reading that's making you not want to eat?
- Exactly.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,800
Master Tang, I'm worried to death.

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Currently, there is an average of 75 animal species that go extinct every day.

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,700
And now because of global warming, South Pole's iceberg is melting.

76
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,900
The habitat for small penguins is becoming fewer and fewer.

77
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,600
They are so pitiful.

78
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,300
I'm thinking if one day I could join the research team,

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,600
I definitely want to become a member of "Save the Penguins."

80
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,100
No need to spend money on Penguin Memberships, I have them all.
(Y/N: referring to memberships on the chatting platform, Tencent QQ)

81
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,900
For example, the red diamond, green diamond, blue diamond. I'll give them to you later.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,400
That's why Master Tang, my biggest dream right now

83
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,000
is to go to the South Pole one day to rescue those animals.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,200
My biggest dream right now is that I can go with you when that day comes.

85
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Master Tang, what's your dream?

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
My dream...

87
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,200
Maybe the moment I gave up short track speed skating,

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,800
I didn't have a dream anymore.

89
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay, good. Make sure to have feeling.

90
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
Do you still want to skate?

91
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,600
Of course.

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
But I know

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
short track speed skating to me is as far away as the stars now.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,100
Xiao Xia, where do you want to have lunch later?

95
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't just stare. You're so skinny. You should eat more!

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Look at our Master Tang, at how healthy looking she is.

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,700
I don't mean it that way.

98
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,300
I need to take this call. You two go ahead.

99
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,600
Bye-bye.

100
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Later, behind our school...

101
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,600
Manager Ma, what's up?

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,400
Tang Xue, do you have time? Come over to the gym.

103
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,300
Manager Ma, have you forgotten?

104
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,700
I already terminated the contract. I'm no longer your assistant.

105
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,400
You've misunderstood! Come to the rink if you are free.

106
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Coach Chu of the short track speed skating wants to see you.

107
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,800
The short track speed skating team needs an assistant, too?

108
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
You child, why are you so stubborn?

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
I just want to ask you. Do you want to train in short track speed skating?

110
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Short track speed skating?

111
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Definitely!

112
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Please come in.

113
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,100
You are Coach Chu?

114
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,000
You're Tang Xue.

115
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,000
If I remember correctly when you were eleven,

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,500
you became the city-level junior 500-meter speed skating champion.

117
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,600
At 13 years old, you broke the record

118
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,900
for the fastest middle school 500-meter race in the entire province.

119
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,000
When you were 15, although you were training at a non-professional sports school,

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,400
you still skated into a national top ten spot.

121
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,100
But at 16,

122
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,900
because of an injury, you disappeared from the short track speed skating world.

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,900
Are you from the National Security Agency?

124
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,000
I've known about you since a long time ago.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
And I coincidentally saw you and Zhang Yuewei's

126
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,200
friendly contest last time. Though you lost to her for quite a bit,

127
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,600
I could tell that you have the foundation.

128
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,800
I don't understand what you mean.

129
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,400
What I want to say is that our LUU XDragons Team's mission

130
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,800
is to gather the best athletes. I want to see your current level.

131
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,100
If your level reaches our standards and you agree to it as well,

132
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,000
you can join our short track speed skating team.

133
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
What? You are not willing?

134
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,700
Willing... I'm willing...

135
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,300
It's just... a bit unbelievable.

136
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,500
Then let's not waste time talking.

137
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,600
Change your shoes and get on the ice. Let's go.

138
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,300
Is this for real or not?

139
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,710
Isn't that the Autobot from the inline skating race?

140
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,650
Yeah. Last time she lost to Sister Wei-wei.

141
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,670
What is she doing here? Unless Coach Chu is letting her join the team?

142
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,960
Timed 500-meters, you only have one chance.

143
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,050
Her start was good, but her turning is poor. She was better at inline skating.

144
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,100
You should just pray that she gets into the team.

145
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,810
Or else, your time is still the slowest.

146
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,230
What are you saying?

147
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,920
All right, stop talking nonsense. Just watch.

148
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She's still not good enough.

149
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,470
I can start over.

150
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,780
There's no need. I've seen enough.

151
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,700
You have the foundation but since you haven't trained for a while, your muscles have degenerated quite severely.

152
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,110
There's a huge gap compared to professional athletes.

153
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,790
I can do it.

154
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,240
With your current condition,

155
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,750
even with your best efforts, it'll be hard to reach the professional skill level to compete in a short amount of time.

156
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,500
If our speed skating team needs you, Manager Ma will contact you.

157
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
That's all for now.

158
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,770
What are you doing?

159
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,280
I went to the restroom.

160
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,680
You're bringing ice skates to the restroom and it's the one in the gym.

161
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,830
What? The toilet in your dorm is clogged?

162
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,400
So that's what happened.

163
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,640
Well, Old Tang, you're already really good.

164
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,790
Even Coach Chu noticed you.

165
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,030
You can count on one hand the number of people she pays attention to in LUU.

166
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,180
That's pretty good.

167
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,400
You don't have to comfort me. I know there's no hope.

168
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,220
She told you to wait for news, that doesn't mean there's no hope. Everything good requires patience.

169
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,100
Stop picking your fingers and stop looking so gloomy.

170

How about this? Based on our past master and servant relationship,

171
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,470
I'll be extremely generous and help you divert your attention elsewhere.

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,290
Good!

176
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,160
I never would have thought you would vent so thoroughly.

177
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,180
Your method is too good.

178
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,210
In order to reward you, I...

179
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,410
- will go one more solo for you.
- Don't, don't, don't.

180
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,490
No--how about-- you rest a while first?

181
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,550
Was my singing that terrible?

182
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,600
How is that possible? You sang so well. I'm just afraid that the song is too difficult and your throat will hurt.

183
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,230
That's true! My parents told me the same.

184
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,790
So next, I will sing for everyone the song "Bu Ran."

185
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,400
Then you can sing first. I need to use the restroom.

186
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,920
Am I really not good at anything?

187
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,140
Of course not, come...

189
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,590
Look. You have a lot of good traits.

190
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,200
Of course, you also have flaws. But there's no perfect person.

There's no one who is completely perfect in this world.

192
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,630
Then tell me.

193
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,200
You want me to say it?

194
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,300
For example, you...

195
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,470
sometimes have a big heart and will often neglect others' feelings. In addition, you've always been a bit overbearing,

196
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,180
you like to take charge of everything.

197
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,760
- Things of that sort...
- That's right.

198
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,220
Now, list out my flaws.

199
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,380

Maybe you really don't have any flaws.

202
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,170
Didn't you say there's no perfect person?

203
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,020
You're an exception.

211
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,870
What? You want to go to Tianjing?
(T/N: he thought he heard Tianjing instead of kaixing meaning happy)

212
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,520
I said I'm quite happy today!

213
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,200
Happy; quite good.

214
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,280
It is a general term for the sloth suborder of the trichomonas order in the Mammalia class.

215
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,330
Mammal.

216
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,100
There are five pairs of teeth in the upper jaw, four pairs in the lower jaw, for a total of 18 teeth.

217
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,240
Altogether there are two families, two genera, and six species.

218
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,460
The shape is similar to that of a monkey.

219
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,260
They move very slowly and can stay on a tree branch for many hours without moving.

220
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,650
What are you doing?

221
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,380
Are you still studying?

222
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,300
- Why are you so similar to a sloth that you even grow plants on your body?
- Grow plants?

223
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,860
Scientists analyzed the sloth's body. It rears a unique type of "sloth moth."

224
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,930
The amount can go up to more than 100.

225
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,300
On the sloth's body, they sustain a miniature ecosystem.

226
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,200
They feed on the algae on the sloth's body, then--

227
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,300
Then the sloth will pick up these moths and eat them.

Why are you only looking at books? Look at...

Why don't you look at people? Look at me.

242

You shouldn't think about it too much. Just go back and sleep.

243
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,980

Why are you looking at me like that?

248
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,230
Today, I feel like you're different from your usual self.

249
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,930
Different how?

250
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,110
Today, brought back memories of when we were little.

251
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,630
Back then if we both went to Sixth Middle School,

252
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,080
then got into LUU together,

253
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,460
then right now, would we be...

254
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,330
Be what?

255
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,350
The best of buddies.

256
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,490
Yeah, maybe.

257
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,000
Sorry, I poked your sore spot again.

258
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,180
It was me who broke the promise. Why is she apologizing?

259
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,650
Oh yeah, Tang Xue.

260
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,400
Actually, I should be saying sorry because...

261
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,930
I know that it wasn't your fault.

262
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,030
If it wasn't because of your parent's divorce, you wouldn't have been forced to go to First Middle School.

263
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,020
Though I always thought

264
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,970
I lost a good friend so I was upset for quite a while.

265
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,310
Divorce?

266
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,220
Let's not talk about that anymore.

267
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,570
Go back and have a good night's sleep. Maybe you'll wake up and

268
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,370
nothing will have changed but you'll feel completely energized!

269
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,170
All right, go back.

270
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,690
Stay positive. Bye.

271
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,450
Hello, Coach Chu. Are you still at the office?

272
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,760
I have something I want to discuss with you.

273
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Huan-huan, the style of these gloves are so unique, Master Tang must like them.

274
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,100
I never thought we would find such cute ones.

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
Isn't that Ice God?

276
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,900
Let's go. We bought all we needed.

277
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,510
Huan-huan, don't Leave.

278
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,800
What?

279
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,070
It's still early so why don't we go have some fun?

280
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,880
Let's go watch a movie. Let's go!

281
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,240
- Let's go watch a movie.
- I don't want to go.

282
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,900
I'm not going! I want to go back home.

283
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,100
You don't want to go watch a movie, then... wherever you want to go, I'll accompany you.

284
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,900
We can go eat or...

285
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,090
Huan-huan, what's wrong?

286
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,400
Are you ill? Do you have a stomachache?

287
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,390
Put it down! It's so disgusting!

288
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,380
J-J-J-J-Just put that back! Worms are so disgusting!

289
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,160
You're a man and get scared so easily.

290
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,360
I think every animal deserves to be loved.

291
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,200
No matter what it looks like.

292
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,330
Little worm, I'm telling you not to run around next time.

293
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,210
Otherwise, you'll be dead if you run into a bad man like him.

294
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,640
I'll bring you back home. Let's go!

295
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,790
Bye-bye.

296
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,860
Huan-huan, just now,

297
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,520
you were like a fairy.

298
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,110
I know where to go. Come on.

299
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,280
- Go where?
- Come on!

300
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,420
Oh, so cute.

301
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,150
It's so cute.

302
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,940
Why do you insist on crawling this way?

303
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,510
Do you like me?

304
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,370
Come.

305
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,350
What are you doing?

306
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,890
Play with it.

307
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,260
I can play with walnuts. This? So oily. You'll break it.

308
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,010
It's so cute! You've no loving soul.

309
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,880
Isn't it, Sweetie?

310
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,280
I don't think it's cute.

311
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,300
Xia Menghuan, your taste is a bit odd.

312
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,490
I am a different kind, as the proverb says,

313
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,900
like calls to like. Like-minded people will be the ones who come together.

314
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,230
The two of us should not contact each other as often in the future.

315
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,010
Sweetie, I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

316
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,820
Bye bye. Let's go!

317
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
Stop right there!

318
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Oh, what do I do?

319
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,490
It feels good, right?

320
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,150
Xia Menghuan, if you are a different kind, I will strive to be your kind.

321
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,120
What are you doing? Which kind do you strive to be?

322
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,930
I think you are in need of hibernating.

323
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,730
You two want it or not?

324
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,660
You touch it. She touches it. I'm telling you. My snake...

325
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,480
hasn't eaten meat for many days, you know?

326
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,470
Let go.

327
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,900
How's your interview going?

328
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,870
Of course. All thanks to you.

329
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,020
I am familiar with the classmates in the publicity department.

330
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,760
So if you need anything, you can tell me.

331
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,930
Thank you.

332
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,030
I'll help him this once, maybe I can use him in the future.

333
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,680
I bought this when I was in the exchange program at the University of Southern California.

334
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,220
I think it'll be very useful for you.

335
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,550
Giving her a small gift

336
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,200
will help me with a few things at LUU in the future.

337
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,420
It's the English original version.

338
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,590
I believe with your level,

339
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,930
there won't be a problem.

340
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,800
Show off.

341
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Satisfy your vanity.

342
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,430
Um.. right.. Is Tang Xue also at LUU?

343
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah. Tang Xue is also at LUU.

344
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,300
She's a veterinary medicine major.

345
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,410
Veterinary medicine?

346
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,130
Why did she choose this major?

347
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,670
Maybe because that's already a bit difficult.

348
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,930
Since before she was a sports student...

349
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,220
That day at LUU ice rink,

350
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,850
I saw Tang Xue.

351
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,930
Does she have a boyfriend right now?

352
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,180
What?

353
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,760
If I remember correctly,

354
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,000
in high school, didn't you reject her?

355
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,210
Bian Cheng, today is the 100th day that I've liked you.

356
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,760
Maybe in your eyes, I'm just a normal sports student.

357
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,230
But I'm not bad.

358
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,530
One day, I'll be just like you, someone who shines like a bright light.

359
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,440
I will stand side by side together with you. Tang Xue.

360
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,200
[Focus decides everything.]

361
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,410
Back then, all my thoughts and efforts were put into getting into a university.

362
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,830
So it's like that.

363
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,860
So.. you also like her?

364
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,020
She told me that she wanted to be like me, someone who shines brightly.

365
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,280
But actually she's that person who shines bright.

366
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,660
Making it hard for people not to notice her.

367
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,100
Shining bright? Is she a firefly?

368
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,010
I hope she relays these words to Tang Xue.

369
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,350
Then you better take quick action. I heard that she

370
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,060
is really close with Li Yubing from the ice hockey team.

371
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,100
Li Yubing?

372
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
He's a legend of LUU.

373
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,790
He's on the same level as you, the MU elite.

374
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,210
And he has the advantage of being nearby.

375
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,360
So you better take action quickly.

376
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,060
But..

377
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,440
I feel like I have no right to appear in front of her right now.

378
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,120
Tang Xue,

379
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,160
actually, I have also been observing you.

380
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,850
[Tang Xue, actually, I have also been observing you.]

381
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,590
Tang Xue,

382
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,990
I received your feelings, but my priority is to get into university,

383
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,310
I don't have time to date.

384
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,820
I'm sorry.

385
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,690
Bian Cheng, do me a favor. Help me tell the class president I'm taking the afternoon off.

386
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,990
There's a qualification game in the afternoon that is very important to Master Tang.

387
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,510
I have to go cheer her on. Help me out.

388
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,900
What important competition?

389
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,560
I heard the National Team scouts are going to be there.

390
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,800
This time, Master Tang will succeed like a carp leaping over the dragon's gate. Bye-bye.

391
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,650
Don't forget!

392
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,000
How was Tang Xue's competition? Why are you back alone?

393
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
Master Tang...

394
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,560
What happened?

395
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,590
She injured herself really badly in the competition.

396
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,510
She's injured?

397
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,350
What does the doctor say?

398
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,330
The doctor said she'll recover from her injury,

399
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,210
but her life in short track speed skating is finished.

400
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,020
So it's like that. I only knew that at that time,

401
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,570
she gave up short track speed skating and focused on the college entrance exam.

402
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,660
I never thought this was the reason.

403
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,190
If it wasn't because of me,

404
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,060
Tang Xue probably would be in the National Team.

405
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,790
But... I don't even have the courage to apologize to her.

406
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,360
If I were you,

407
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,800
I would pursue her again.

408
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,920
But... she probably wouldn't forgive me.

409
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,230
Do you know that I've always admired you.

410
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,740
Because you are someone that if they have a goal,

411
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,400
they would do their best efforts to achieve it.

412
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,690
But... what is wrong with you now?

413
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,350
Yes,

414
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,390
what you said is right.

415
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,920
Focus decides everything.

416
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,890
Don't worry. One is my cousin

417
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,300
and one is my old classmate.

418
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,230
I'll definitely help you guys.

419
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,930
Thank you.

420
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,860
What are you doing?

421
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,690
I want to know the answer to that, too.

422
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,410
Him? He's already in the stage of viewing his past as miserable and his present as happy.

423
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,020
Fatty, just leave him alone.

[A Panoramic View of People]

425
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,270
A pig's daily diet needs to be diversified.

426
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,090
The ratio could be 20% potatoes,

427
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,930
20% corn, 20% bran, and 10% bean products,

428
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,890
and plenty of water.

429

Little ra...

430
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,320
Little raven?

431
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,930
Why do I feel like you're eating like a pig?

432
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:18,470
Don't eat so much. You'll get fat.

433
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,060
Then so be it. I can't get into the speed skating team anyway. It's fine.

434
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,980
Don't eat so much.

Manager Ma.

436
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,700
Report to the short track speed skating team tomorrow?

437
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,040
Okay! I'll be on time.

438
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,870
Wow, Master Tang! Congratulations.

439
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,230
Your wish came true!

440
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,580
Tang Xue, congratulations.

441
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,280
What's wrong?

442
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,020
Why aren't you happy? Getting on the short track speed skating team

443
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,680
is your dream. With your temper, you should have jumped on the roof with happiness.

444
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,800
Can I really do it?

445
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,570
People tend to choose something they are interested in among many other things

446
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,720
and then they will be able to do it well. In actuality, it is the opposite.

447
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,840
It is because you can do well in this one thing compared to the others

448
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,870
that you take this one thing as your hobby.

449
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,110
Old Ye is right.

450
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,270
Let me ask you, Master Tang. Do you really like short track speed skating?

451
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:38,110
Do you think you can do well and put all your focus into it?

452
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,260
Then go ahead and do it.

453
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,570
We're all supporting you. Especially me and Xiao Liao. We know you can do it.

454
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,230
Wait.

455
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,430
The gift to celebrate you getting into the team,

456
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,440
we already prepared it for you.

457
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
See if you like it.

458
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,540
This book is my nourishment for the mind, please take it.

459
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,200
Congratulations.

460
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,570
I still have five copies.

461
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,260
Tang Xue, you can do it.

462
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,760
You definitely can do it. Congratulations!

463
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,880
You're Tang Xue. What are you afraid of?

464
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,230
You got this!

465
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,800
Though your skill level doesn't meet the requirement to enter the speed skating team.

466
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,390
Looking at your previous records and current situation,

467
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,340
I want to keep you under observation a bit longer.

468
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,270
I know that I'm not good enough, but I'll put in all my efforts.

469
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:52,690
That better be so. But you have to understand that you are in the trial period.

470
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:57,030
Whether or not you can become an actual team member is dependent on your future scores.

471
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,980
As long as I can stay, I don't care how you train me.

472
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,790
Good. The slowest member on the team right now is Li Hongshuang.

473
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,620
After a month, if you can be at her speed, then you can stay.

474
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,280
Okay.

475
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,410
But who is Li Hongshuang?

476
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,280
Come. I'll introduce you to the other members.

477
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,070
Also.

478
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,030
This is for you.

479
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,330
Coach, this is really hard to buy. I've always liked them.

480
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,530
Thank you, Coach. I've inconvenienced you.

481
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,730
Let's go.

482
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,690
- Does it look good?
- It looks good.

483
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,720
Did you guys hear about the LUU ice rink myth?

484
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,350
I heard as long as a boy and girl kiss in the rink after 9:00 p.m,

485
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,230
they'll be together forever.

486
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,780
Apparently, that's how Mommy Chu and Coach Xu got together.

487
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,870
Don't make stuff up. Didn't they divorce?

488
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,460
A fake one, you call it a myth; the real one, you call it science.

489
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,990
Hey.

490
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,350
Don't talk about our coach.

491
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:50,200
You're too gossipy, talking science. My tarot cards are more accurate.

492
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,960
Hongshuang, if you have time for this, you might as well use it on training.

493
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,750
You're currently the worst skater on the team; don't always think about playing around.

494
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,670
The scores I have right now are temporary. A woman is very different when they grow up compared to them being young.

495
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,840
Maybe soon, I will become a world champion.

496
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,960
Then hurry up and check with your tarot when you'll be a world champion.

497
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,190
Go away.

498
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,470
I already checked it. I will definitely become a world champion later.

499
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,480
Boasting.

500
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,700
Sister Wei,

501
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,420
- let me do a tarot reading for you.
- I don't believe in this.

502
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,090
- Just do a reading.
- Do a reading! We got nothing else to do.

503
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,420
Do a reading. Hurry, choose one.

504
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,550
- This one.
- Okay.

505
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,990
- What is it?
- Wow.

506
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,520
Sister Wei, someone who has a crush on you will confess to you soon.

507
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,240
Wow!

508
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,800
All right, you guys, this is all nonsense.

509
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,230
Looks like our woman in charge will soon have a man in charge!

510
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,810
Do you need a good beating, Xiao Yuan?

511
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,010
- Coach.
- Coach.

512
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:59,180
I'm going to introduce a new teammate. This is Tang Xue.

513
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,480
Hello, everyone, I'm Tang Xue. I'm honored to be teammates with everyone.

514
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,110
Though I haven't practiced for two years, I'm definitely not on the same level as everyone.

515
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:17,640
I hope everyone can help me during future training.

516
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,550
Isn't she useless if she hasn't trained for two years?

517
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,100
She's really joining our team?

518
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,810
With her performance... it's so annoying.

519
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,660
Siyu,

520
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,130
please take your hand out.

521
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,610
Turn it over.

522
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,060
Go wash them.

523
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,480
Yes.

524
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,040
Jinyuan, have you just finished eating pig's blood?

525
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,480
N-No.

526
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,050
Your whole mouth is shimmering. Go wipe it off.

527
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,550
Okay.

528
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,560
Li Hongshuang, Great Immortal Li.

529
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,900
Make a prediction for me. When will your performance improve?

530
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,360
Go. Run the track thirty times.

531
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,810
Yes.

532
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,800
This is our team captain, Zhang Yuewei.

533
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,550
Yuewei, take her to train on the ground and acclimate tomorrow.

534
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,430
Yes, Coach.

535
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,430
Tang Xue, go home to adjust. Tomorrow, you'll officially start training.

536
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,230
Thank you, Coach.

537
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,790
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫
