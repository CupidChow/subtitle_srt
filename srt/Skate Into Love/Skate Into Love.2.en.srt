[Skate into Love]

17
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,000
[Episode 2]

18
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,030
This person looks so familiar.

19
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,930
Li Yubing? It's you, Li Yubing?

20
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,030
You should've told me it was you earlier.

21
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,170
You are...?

22
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,520
Tang Xue. You don't remember me?

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,730
Tang Xue?

24
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,470
I sat next to you in elementary school.

25
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,710
Oh! Tang Xue. Master Tang from when we were young.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,060
I thought you forgot about me. Here. Sit.

27
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,760
Here, move over a bit.

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,840
How could I forget about you? Under your care,

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,590
I never spent my allowance money of all six years in elementary school.

30
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,480
That's exactly right. You spent it all on buying things for me.

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,630
We were so close at that time.

32
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,030
But you are doing well.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,030
Just getting into college, you are already so famous. You are already the Ice God.

34
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,090
I am not considered "just" getting into college.

35
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,810
I skipped a grade in high school. I am a sophomore in college.

36
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,960
I am in the sports college, minoring in Astronomy.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,890
Astro... minor...

38
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,320
Even a minor is so difficult.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Some people are just always a top student starting from childhood.

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,590
Now that they're older, they're indeed the top of the top.

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,460
Oh right, Tang Xue. What is your major?

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,120
- Veterinarian medicine.
- Oh right! I remember.

43
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,070
A vet?

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,320
It's okay. It doesn't matter what major you are in to be my assistant.

45
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,600
Before I came in, I was scared you were going to be some kind of perverted boss.

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,890
What would I do if they deliberately made things difficult for me every day? Fortunately, it's you. Right?

47
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,980
Back then, I was your boss. Now, you are mine.

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,110
This is called "The fragrance remains in the hand that gives the rose." Right?
(T/N: helping others will benefit yourself as well)

49
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,440
You didn't purposely hire me, so you could thank me. Right?

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,580
She is even more shameless than back then.

51
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,040
Yes, I need to repay you well.

52
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,940
Remember to report here tomorrow.

53
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,730
No problem! What do you want me to do?

54
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,350
Do whatever I tell you to.

55
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,640
Just like how you treated me when we were kids.

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,650
To me, elementary school was hell.

57
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,350
- What?
- My grandpa said

58
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,600
he'll only take me to Disneyland if I get first place in this exam. You can't get full marks for both.

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,180
Otherwise, I'll put caterpillars in your school bag every day. One a day!

60
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,140
Try if you don't believe me.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,620
When you guys get better at ice skating and enter the club,

62
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,380
your positions will be called skate patrollers.

63
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,640
- How's that?
- Master Tang, you really are too awesome. Do you know how many students

64
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,680
envy that we entered the ice hockey team?

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,300
I think Li Yubing is different from what he used to be like.

66
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,890
- He's changed.
- Changed?

67
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,270
Heraclitus said "No man ever steps in the same river twice,

68
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,690
for it's not the same river and he's not the same man."

69
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,290
The only thing that doesn't change is change itself.

70
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,140
So then, is there change or not?

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,630
Master Tang, Li Yubing really was your deskmate in elementary school?

72
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,270
Of course! At that time, if I pointed east, he wouldn't dare go west.

73
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,280
He was more cute and obedient than you.

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,370
Now, times have changed.

75
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,570
I've heard that all the girls say he is an ice mountain.

76
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,500
It's like he's got words carved into his forehead, "Girls, stay clear."

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,290
Has he been like that since he was a child?

78
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,750
When he was young...

79
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,940
When he was young, he was very easy-going.

80
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,120
Little Bing, speak.

81
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,930
If you don't speak, you won't get any candy.

82
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,460
You should smile, not cry. You need to be graceful and subdued.

83
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,750
I know.

84
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,440
Okay! You may leave.

85
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,230
Very good. Then let's kiss goodbye.

86
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,370
Tang Xue, from now on.

87
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,980
It's time for you to have nightmares.

88
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,390
Who's scolding me?

89
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,260
- Our training hasn't finished yet.
- But we have to start training. You guys are already five minutes in overtime.

90
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,060
- You guys have also gone overtime before.
- We, what we? Hurry up!

91
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,120
What's going on? You're still not on the ice.

92
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,840
The Ice God is here.

93
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,560
Brothers! Let's hurry up and give them the space.

94
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,760
Clear the space for our friends. Hurry up!

95
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,070
He's really underestimating us.
(T/N: lit. not taking bean buns as food)

96
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,230
Captain, we don't have enough time to train again.

97
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,440
There's nothing we can do. He's the Ice God.

98
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,240
However, a heavyweight will also be joining our figure skating team soon.

99
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,820
When the time comes, just wait and see.

100
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,360
Brothers! Get on the ice!

101
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,850
Li Yubing.

102
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,880
You're here. Everyone, come over here first.

103
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,180
Your ice rink is so professional.

104
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,590
Let me introduce her to everyone here. This is our hockey team's new assistant,

105
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,350
Classmate Tang Xue.

106
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,250
Am I not your personal assistant?

107
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,090
- What's mine is everyone else's, right?
- Right!

108
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,720
When we were little, all of my things were yours. I'm only this generous because I learned from you.

109
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,820
Oh right! In the future everyone's hockey sticks and helmets can all be given to Tang Xue to wipe.

110
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,940
- Sorry for the trouble!
- Then can my gloves be wiped, too?

111
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,810
- No problem!
- Sorry for the trouble!

112
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,840
All right now. Hurry up and go train.

113
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,080
Why did you bring shoes?

114
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,680
Can't I skate for free?

115
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,930
We need to train.

116
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,400
I know. I can skate when you guys are done.

117
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,510
- I'm hungry. Buy food for me first.
- Okay, what do you want to eat?

118
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,450
- You should get a notebook to write it down.
- I can remember it.

119
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,700
Coriander, loofah, green peas,

120
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,680
Chinese toon, meatballs, bitter melon.

121
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,010
Coriander, loofah, bitter melon, green peas,

122
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,430
Chinese toon, pig intestines, meatballs.

123
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,290
Did you finish writing them down?

124
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,410
Go ahead.

125
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,770
I don't eat any of these.

126
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,840
Three meat dishes and two vegetable dishes. After getting the food, deliver it to the ice hockey team's changing room.

127
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,350
What? Oh right. I looked at your class schedule. This afternoon, you don't have any classes.

128
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,630
After you've finished getting the food, come here immediately to accompany me in training.

129
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,330
You have my class schedule?!

130
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,050
15 minutes.

131
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,890
No green peppers in that one, no bitter melon in this one,

132
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,570
no green peppers and pig intestines in this one. Thank you auntie.

133
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,210
You don't want pig intestines in griddled (lit. dry wok) pork intestines. How about I just give you a wok.

134
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,630
Do you want it or not. If not, leave. Next.

135
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,380
- I do! I do want it, Auntie!
- Can you stop playing around, I've got to go to class. Please hurry!

136
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,240
Sorry.

137
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,580
Bing-bing! Let's go eat.

138
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,610
I've eaten.

139
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,600
Don't you usually always eat with me?

140
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,690
You're abandoning a brother?

141
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,460
You're going too far, eating a solo meal.

142
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,780
Eat.

143
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,810
Did your brain run away from home?

144
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,110
What did I tell you?

145
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,320
I'll pick it out for you.

146
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,070
Is there food on my face?

147
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,080
I just want to say, you forgot the soup.

148
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,730
Drink water.

149
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,170
Plain water has no flavor. I don't like drinking it.

150
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,200
You still have time if you go now.

151
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,380
You've still got 10 minutes.

152
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
[Cafeteria]

153
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,900
There's a box of junk over there. Take it out in a bit.

154
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,080
There are also a few boxes of pucks. We'll need to use them in training this afternoon.

155
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,740
Move them all out onto the ice rink.

156
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,040
All of them?

157
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,740
All of them.

158
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,490
How am I supposed to move so much by myself?

159
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,620
That's your own problem. Not mine.

160
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,170
Hurry up.

161
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,650
Do you know what you should do when you get tired from moving them?

162
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,700
No.

163
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,470
Is my school bag heavy?

164
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,030
Yes.

165
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,450
Then change shoulders.

166
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,250
Change boxes and continue moving them.

167
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,620
When will they finish training?

168
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,700
Hey, get up.

169
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,480
You've finished training?

170
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,900
They're almost closing. Let's go.

171
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,510
I haven't even trained!

172
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,630
Tang Xue, do you want me to give you a lift?

173
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,210
Okay.

174
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,820
In your dreams.

175
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,410
How did a good child become crooked?

176
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,130
Have you guys eaten? Let's eat together.

177
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,460
We've already eaten. Doesn't the Ice God take care of meals?

178
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,010
I'm starving to death. I haven't eaten all day.

179
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,970
Master Tang...

180
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,560
Where did you learn to do makeup?

181
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,920
Li Yubing. You filthy dog!

182
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,730
Master Tang, stop being upset. Maybe the Ice God was just messing with you.

183
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,650
Although this dining environment of ours isn't ideal, what's most important is to be full from eating.

184
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,260
I've heard food can solve 90% of suffering.

185
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,660
Then, what about the other 10%?

186
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,850
The pain of being unable to lose weight after eating.

187
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:49,100
This really is the first time in my life I'm eating boiled noodles on a toilet.

188
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,560
The dorm auntie doesn't allow us to use high-powered electrical appliances.

189
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,360
Fortunately, our Little Ye is smart

190
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,100
and knows that there's no electricity limit here. Buy some vegetables and we could even have hotpot.

191
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,960
Montaigne said, "One must have three minds."

192
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,330
The first is from birth, the second is from books,

193
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,830
and the third is learned from life!

194
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,440
You guys wait.

195
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,180
Bro, you... you sure about just putting chicken essence?

196
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,350
A wise man once said,”Knowledge comes from experience."

197
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,050
You guys have a taste?

198
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,250
It's too delicious!

199
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,410
Li Yubing.

200
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,790
Tang Xue, how do you dare treat your employer like this?

201
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,810
So, fire me.

202
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,370
Fire me!

203
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,380
Why?

204
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,940
If I say I want to study well, will you believe me? Asking when you already know the answer.

205
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,360
Fine.

206
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,130
Are you planning on leaving now, straightaway, immediately, or after one month?

207
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,850
Of course, it's now, straightaway, immediately. Right now!

208
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,690
Okay. Pay the breach of contract penalty.

209
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,830
What breach of contract penalty?

210
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,050
Didn't you read it in the contract?

211
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,750
If you suddenly propose to cancel the contract on a unilateral basis, you'll need to pay a breach of contract penalty up to a maximum of ¥100,000.

212
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,160
Of course, you can also follow the normal procedures and propose to cancel the contract one month in advance.

213
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,520
Impossible, I read the contract. It didn't have this clause.

214
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,800
You didn't read the contract carefully, did you?

215
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,390
I suggest you go back and read the contract carefully before you discuss with me again.

216
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,720
I wish you a good mood today. Bye-bye.

217
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,810
You dog! Why are you treating me like this?

218
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,760
Aren't you asking when you already know the answer?

219
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,070
There is also deep research into the area of protecting vets from infectious diseases.

220
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,180
Especially zoonosis.

221
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,680
Yet, clinical vets mainly deal with treating acute illnesses in big and small animals.

222
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,650
In the future, you will realize, from small hamsters to big lions–

223

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
Big lions, Professor.

226
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,840
Right.

227
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,920
In the future, you will realize, from small hamsters to big lions, they're all your patients.

228
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,400
Especially now, as there are more cats and dogs as pets–

229
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,910
What's the situation? Did you quit?

230
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,260
I was bitten by a dog.

231
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,830
What?

232
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,650
Where?

233
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,100
I'm telling you, you girls

234
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,300
really need a boyfriend to protect you.

235
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
If Master Tang had a boyfriend,

236
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,000
would Li Yubing still dare to bully her?

237
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It still depends on what kind of boyfriend.

238
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,700
I'd say I'm a pretty good choice.

239

You came this early?

Sorry, I mistook you for someone else! I'm sorry!

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,000
I think I forgot my student ID today.

246

Can you buy me a soy milk?

247
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,200
Okay.

248
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Hey, buy an extra one.

249
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
I'll transfer the money to you.

250

Oh, okay.

251

Mission accomplished.

252

You're right.

254

The more I look, the more I agree.

255
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Me being this age, it's the first time I've ever seen someone use soy milk to make a friend.

257

That was just an apology. What do you know?

258
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,700
Apology. Apology, right.

259
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,600
Oh right. I heard you're letting someone bully you.

260
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,000
I never thought someone would actually dare to bully you.

261
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,800
Looking back, I was better than him.

262

But now when we see each other, he is accomplished.

263

Yet I haven't achieved anything.

He has no regard for old affections?

268

I'm telling you, I've been thinking about this all day.

269

He doesn't even know how cocky he is anymore.

273
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,300
He doesn't even know who he is anymore. He must

Then lets just quit. What can he do anyway?

282
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,500
There's a black and white contract

283
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,600
that says I have to pay ¥100,000 for breach of contract.

¥100,000?

315
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,300
Yes, Boss, I understand.

316
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Li Yubing's condition is very good. Just relax, okay?

317
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Everything is arranged.

318
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Why did they not tell me someone was coming?

319
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,500
You're still worried when I'm handling it?

320
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,700
I saw it.
(T/N: same as "I see you!")

321
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,300
It's not useful and not easy to do.

322
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,500
It's not like I can do something just because I want to.

323
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,000
In the end, it's all decided by Ice God.

324
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah. We already found an assistant.

325
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,000
We're sending him warmth. Rest assured.

326
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,500
That's something weird, too. There were so many good candidates!

327
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,200
Why would he choose that girl?

328
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,900
Why are you worried when I'm taking care of everything?

329
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,500
I know.

330
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,200
What happened yesterday was like I said, right?

331
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,300
Really? Yes, it's like that every time.

332
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

333
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
That's right.

334
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,710
Look! Can you also be more considerate of me?

335
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,700
You always take someone else's side.

336
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Okay, okay, okay.

337
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,100
I know. I told you already.

338
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,800
Don't worry, I'm following up.

339
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,100
Anyway, I know how to take care of it. Okay?

340
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,200
Okay, that's fine.

341
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Good game today.

342
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,000
Don't open! Please don't open!

343
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,200
Come on, hurry up.

344
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Bing-bing.

345
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,000
What are you waiting for? Still not changing?

346
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,600
I'll help you.

347
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
No thanks, I'll do it myself.

348
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,900
I'll wait for you in the dorm.

349
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,400
The labor contract?

350
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,500
Give it to me!

351
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
I'll tear it up!

352
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,200
You tear it, and I'll call the guys back.

353
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,000
Bring it out right now by yourself.

354
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,200
If you're so capable, get it yourself.

355
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,400
Then don't blame me for being impolite.

356
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,280
Work hard in the future. Don't think about doing these useless things.

357
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,150
Come out.

358
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,490
Master Tang,

359
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,460
I was wrong. I won't do it again.

360
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,900
I'll make it up to you, okay?

361
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,780
Rousseau said "Man is born free,

362
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,020
and everywhere, he is in chains."

363
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,900
Then, did the great master say what to do when you experience hardship?

364
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,590
As you slowly get older, you will realize

365
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,220
that even the most terrible hardships only last for a few days.

366
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,510
And then...

367
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,070
you will experience something even worse.

368
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,760
That's what the great master said?

369
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,280
That was me.

370
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,330
That makes sense.

371
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,670
Before you pay the breach of contract penalty, work as usual.

372

Bring your homework and come study in the library with me.

373
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,300
I've never yet bowed my head to anyone.

374
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,610
It's just one month, I'll put up with it.

375
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,060
Let's see if you die or I live.

376
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,670
Li Yubing, are you a dog? You need someone to keep you company for everything.

377
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,030

378
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,560
Today, I'm formally proposing to quit.

379
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,170
After one month, I'm quitting.

380
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,700
Okay.

381
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,070
I thought top students didn't need to read books and study.

382
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,370
I already read all the course content. This is outside of it.

383
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,100
Is he abnormal? Reading beyond the scope of the syllabus.

384
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,110
Do you need help?

385
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,690
The formula you used here is solved incorrectly.

386
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,550
The shampoo you're wearing seems really familiar.

387
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,080
You even know how to be shy?

388
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,510
I'm not shy.

389
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,420
I'll give you a simple math problem. Let's see if you can do it.

390
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,280
I'm not doing it.

391
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,900
This place is this library we're at right now. This...

392
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,630
is the furthest building away from the library in this school.

393
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,530
Let's see if you can work out how many meters it is.

394
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,260
Looking down on people, aren't you? This is middle school math.

395
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,110
If you get it, you get a prize.

396
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,670
2,190.

397
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,190
You're right.

398
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,830
In Room 208 of this building which is 2,190 meters away from us,

399
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,660
there's a gift.

400
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,620
I'll admit, I've made things difficult for you recently.

401
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,030
I was wrong.

402
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,710
Treat this gift as an apology from me.

403
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,990
I hope we can forget the past from now on.

404
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,990
Let's work together well.

405
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,270
Then, why didn't you just give it to me? You put it so far away.

406
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,550
I don't know if you've calculated it,

407
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,970
but it's been six years since we last saw each other in primary school.

408
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,790
It's approximately 2,190 days.

409
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,170
Maybe fate is just coincidental,

410
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,370
but everything is still meaningful.

411
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,890
You like me?

412
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,570
Okay, we're done for today.

413
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,880
After you get the gift, you can go back to your dorm.

414
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,210
It's really quite far. But is it true that we haven't seen each other in this long?

415

I'm really curious about what you ate that day.

422
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,860
That was a really fragrant smell.

Why do you care? Do you want to learn?

424
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,820
¥1,000 as a fee for the recipe. How about it?

425

Bring me breakfast tomorrow as usual. Don't be late.

426
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,540
What happened that day is only known by God, Mother Earth, you, me, and the shower.

427

If anyone else finds out about it...

[Childhood story]

430

My deskmate is called Li Yubing.

431
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,810
He's a very annoying guy.

432
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,340
Why am I annoyed by him?

433
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,430
Because Grandpa promised me,

434
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:36,420
if I could get first in the class for the exam, he'd take me to Disneyland.

435
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,670
I really want to go to Disneyland.

436
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,950
But I'm not first in the class.

437
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,790
Li Yubing is.

438
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,900
Teacher praised Li Yubing at the parent-teacher conference.

439
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,510
Dad said to me, "Look at Li Yubing,

440
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,280
then look at yourself."

441
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,290
I hope Teacher will stop praising Li Yubing,

442
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,650
because he's too annoying.

443
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,390
Okay, stop reading.

444
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,190
Do you know why teacher asked you to come to the office?

445
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,980
Classmates should be united and friendly,

446
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,650
helping each other and improving together.

447
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,530
Look at Li Yubing's essay. It's all kind words about you.

448
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,600
He said he likes a deskmate like you.

449
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,930
But then look at your essay. What did you say about him?

450
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,580
Teacher knows you want to get first place. That's a good thing.

451
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,260
But we have to depend on our own hard work and improvement.

452
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,830
We can't hope for other students to deteriorate. If you have a little improvement, Teacher will also praise you.

453
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,800
See! There weren't any incorrect characters in your essay this time.

454
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,980
This is a type of improvement. It's really worth praising.

455
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,230
Li Yubing helped to correct this for me.

456

Then next time, I'll let him correct it again.

♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

471
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:23,390
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

472
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:29,940
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

473
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,360
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

474
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,490
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

475
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,910
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

476
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:56,390
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I
couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

477
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,340
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

478
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:08,630
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

479
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:15,620
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

480
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:21,770
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

481
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:29,330
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

482
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,500
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

483
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:42,830
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

484
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:49,260
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

485
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,240
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

486
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,950
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
