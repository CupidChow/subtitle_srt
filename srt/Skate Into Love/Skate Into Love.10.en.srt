[Episode 10]

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,450
Tang Xue, go home to adjust. Tomorrow, you'll officially start training.

19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,380
Thank you, Coach.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,640
Old Jin, what's the matter?

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,150
Even if you're busy at work,

22
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,180
you have to take care of your body.

23
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,750
I put many red dates in here.

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,050
Thank you. You're a great coworker.

25
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,260
But I—

26
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,590
Don't say anything. I get it.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,900
Okay.

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,540
Thank you. I'll be going.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,080
Coach Jin? Coach Chu just left.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,050
I wasn't looking for her.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,340
Manager Ma, I made the short track speed skating team!

32
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,180
Auntie!

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,800
I made the short track speed skating team!

34
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,140
I made the short track speed skating team!

35
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,640
Really? Old Tang, you're not bad.

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,710
It's really true that I would receive good news once I woke up.

37
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,470
You're really something, Li Yubing.

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,730
Old Xu.

39
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,130
What?

40
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,410
Why does your team's Li Yubing care so much about Tang Xue?

41
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,010
I really don't know the answer to that.

42
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,130
I have taught Li Yubing for so many years, I've never seen him care for anyone this much.

43
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,380
Are they dating?

44
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,860
Don't worry about the issues of young people.

45
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,320
They're adults. It's fine as long as it doesn't affect their training.

46
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,690
What are you saying? How could dating not affect training? Who can multi-task like that?

47
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,460
Old Xu, I'll share the unpleasant news first. I'm keeping Tang Xue for a trial because Ma Xiaoshan and Li Yubing begged me to.

48
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,350
If she can't achieve the level of a professional, I will not give face to anyone.

49
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,620
Look. You're on fire again. I understand Li Yubing well.

50
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,930
If he believes in Tang Xue, you should believe in him.

51
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,190
What if she is a diamond in the rough?

52
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,440
Isn't it a pity if you miss it?

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,910
You're a coach. You need to be more aware.

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,310
Okay.

55
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,190
One person is hidden in the background, secretly assisting someone else.

56
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,760
So moving. It's natural that he is a student of mine. Taking after me.

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
Taking after you?

58
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,400
What do you mean?

59
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,760
Literally.

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,380
It's rude if you say it like that.

61
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,780
Before we got a divorce, wasn't I silently giving you my support every day?

62
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,430
Support?

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,700
- You're talking to me about "support"?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,200
Back then, all the men's chores were done by me. Where were you when the pipe burst at home?

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,100
Where were you when there was a thief in the house? When we were moving, I did it all by myself.

66
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,530
Wasn't I in the hockey training center? You want to talk about this, right?

67
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,100
Who did all the women's chores at home? Wasn't it all me?

68
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,230
Didn't I mop the floors and cook? Where were you? When the clothes were piling up, where were you?

69
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,670
I wanted children and you...

70
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,510
I'm going to train.

71
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,930
Look at you...

72
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,030
Got angry... You're angry again... This temper...

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,770
I haven't finished...

74
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,810
When I wanted kids, you didn't cooperate with me.

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,520
You were in the speed skating team, weren't you?

76
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,730
What's up? Even your appetite's changed after you got divorced?

77
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,950
There's even red dates.

78
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,460
Hello, Manager Ma.

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,830
Fine! I'll be there right away.

80
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,890
I shouldn't have argued with him about the past.

81
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,100
Coach, you're really letting that Tang Xue into the team?

82
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,290
This is a decision between the club and the coaches. What? You have something to say?

83
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,470
I do have something to say.

84
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,190
- Keep it to yourself.
- But–

85
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,530
You saw her results.

86
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,810
Her skills are not at the level to be a part of the team. If she is in, isn't she just going to drag us down?

87
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,830
Whether Tang Xue is good or not, we'll know the results in a month.

88
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,730
It is still too early to say she'll drag us down.

89
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,640
If she has the potential to develop; wouldn't it be a pity to lose her?

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,750
As the team captain, what you should be doing is helping teammates, not doubting them.

91
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,310
That's all for now.

92
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,150
This pretty lady, I personally made you this latte. I hope you like it.

93
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,070

Nothing.

What?

98
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,920
Why do you look so depressed?

99
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,110
Say, can anyone get into the short track speed skating team nowadays? Even your hockey team's assistant can get in.

100
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,810
Huh? Tang Xue?

101
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,510
You mean Tang Xue got into your speed skating team?

102
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,700
The coffee is pretty good.

103
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,070
As long as you like it, I'll make you a cappuccino next time.

104
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,200
Too sweet. I want a flat white.

105
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,460

106
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,230

Yes. It represents my colorful soul.

111
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,570
You don't know but that day, we had just bought this gift for you,

112
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,790
and you said it was impossible to join the team. I didn't know how to give it to you.

113
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,710
It's all good now. Your training starts tomorrow. Buying them was the right decision.

114
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,940
Don't worry. I'll wear them to the registration in a bit.

115
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,020
Short track speed skating, I'm coming!

116
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,910
Why are you here?

117
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,730
I've just finished the interview. I came to see you on the way.

118
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,180
Did it go well?

119
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,980
Tang Xue, I actually came is to tell you something.

120
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,390
All this time, I didn't have the courage to face you.

121
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,420
Why are you saying these?

122
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,580
Back then, it was because of me

123
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,230
who affected your race and caused you to be injured.

124
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,120
It's all in the past; and see, I'm fine now.

125
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,670
Back then, it was my own mentality that wasn't good. It had nothing to do with you.

126
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,410
Tang Xue.

If...

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,060
If I respond to your letter again right now, would it be too late?

129
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,230
It's already been so long, I don't remember what I wrote in the letter anymore.

130
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,860
It doesn't matter. Goals are hard to reach.

131
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,650
What goal?

132
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,050
Nothing. You have to go to class.

133

Due to the interviews, I'll be coming to LUU more often these days. I won't disturb you this time.

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,800
[Travel to Panama and play with sloths]

160
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,700
Didn't Xia mention this animal that has vegetables growing on its body?

161
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Thank God for looking out for me!

162
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,400
Look, Wu Dajing is coming to our school.
[Keynote Speaker: Wu Dajing]

163
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
Really!

164
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
My dream guy.
(T/N: lit. Male God)

165
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,000
Back then, it was because of me

166
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,600
who affected your race and caused you to be injured.

167
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,000
If...

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,700
If I respond to your letter again right now, would it be too late?

169
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't think about it too much. You should focus on where you are now.

170
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,900
I finally got a trial period of training, it's a rare opportunity.

171
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,300
I have to focus all my energy on short track speed skating right now.

172
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,000
Tang Xue, don't worry. Tomorrow will definitely go well.

173
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,000
Zhang Yuewei, how much do you hate me?

174
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
What do you think?

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,200
I think I'm pretty likable as a person.

176
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
You just dislike me because I'm slow, right?

177
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,300
Let me tell you. Even though I'm the slowest person on the team right now,

178
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,100
sooner or later I'll surpass all of you.

179
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,000
There have been a lot of people who said that, too, when they were in the trial period.

180
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
But out of 10 people, 8 or 9 of them end up leaving.

181
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,100
Let me tell you. I'm going to be that 1 or 2 out of 10 that makes it. If you don't believe me, let's bet on it.

182
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,400
Sure, let's bet.

183
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
If you can stay on the team, I'll sharpen your skates for you.

184
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,500
It's decided then.

185
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Isn't the person screaming, didn't they used to be Ice God's assistant? She's really out of shape.

186
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,100
Looks like Ice God didn't give her that much to do.

187
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,400
She used to be a short track speed skater. And she's only just entered our team.

188
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
But she hasn't trained in very long.

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,200
So now, the first step is to get her back in shape.

190
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Don't worry, Coach Chu.

191
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,900
You have me, a gold-medal coach. Everything is fine. I'll take care of it.

192
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,000
Gold medal? What gold medal?

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,500
It's just a figure of speech. I just want to let you know that you can rely on me.

194
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,300
Okay, switch places.

195
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Come on, don't waste time.

196
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,700
If you ask me, when the Autobot gets mad, it's pretty scary.

197
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,600
Tang Xue wouldn't dare to do anything to Sister Wei. She's a newbie.

198
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,900
She's fierce.

199
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,600
She's the least physically fit on the team, I can't believe she's making a scene like this.

200
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
Only Sister Wei can be like that today.

201
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,300
If it were me, I definitely couldn't handle it.

202
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,000
- Shuang'er.
- Hey, Ice God.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
Where's Tang Xue?

204
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,200
She's still inside. According to the rules of the short track speed skating team, newbies have to clean up.

205
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,700
Got it, thanks.

206
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,400
Bye-bye.

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,500
Before, when I let you do this kind of thing for the hockey team, you made it seem like the worst thing in the world.

208
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,900
How come now you're so enthusiastic about it?

209
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,000
That's why people have to do what they love.

210
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,400
When you're doing something you love, of course, you'll be happier.

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,800
Isn't that right, Ice God?

212
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,400
Ice God?

213
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,200
You wouldn't just say that. You definitely want something.

214
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
What is it?

215
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,600
It's not much, really. I just want to ask...

216
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,400
about tickets to see Wu Dajing's speech at the Glory Ice Summit—

217
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
I don't have any.

218
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,300
Do you really want to go?

219
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,800
Wu Dajing is my senior. We used to train on the same team.

220
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,400
He always took good care of us back then.

221
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,100
So I wanted to go see my idol

222
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,900
to help encourage myself

223
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,900
and tell myself that my idol is not as far away as I think.

224
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,100
Seeing as you're only starting to pursue your dream now,

225
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,400
whereas I'm already doing what I love

226
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,000
and doing it pretty well, I feel like my life is at a high point.

227
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
It's like looking into the mirror in the bathroom.

228
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,700
- What?
- Show-off!

229
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Then forget about tickets to see Wu Dajing.

230
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,100
You can get them?

231
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,700
Just wait.

232
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,800
I'll reward you well.

233
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,300
I picked out this water bottle just for you, and you just left it here.

234
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,900
Li Yubing!

235
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,490
I almost forgot about it.

236
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,400
Thanks.

237
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Wait.

238
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
What?

239
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,500
Wei-wei, sit down for a second.

240
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,000
I want to ask you about something.

241
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
What is it?

242
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Uh, that...

243
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,100
When did you become so timid like this?

244
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,700
What is it? Say it already.

245
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm hesitating because I've thought about this for awhile.

246
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,600
I don't want to upset you by saying this,

247
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,900
and I don't want you to reject me either.

248
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,000
But after thinking about it, I think I should still ask if you're willing.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,300
Sister Wei, someone who has a crush on you will confess to you soon.

250
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,700
Go ahead, I'm listening.

251
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay, then I'll say it.

252
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,300
Actually, I...

253
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,700
I want to ask you to help me look after Tang Xue.

254
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,500
T-Tang Xue?

255
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,100
Tang Xue.

256
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,800
She really loves short track speed skating. But she hasn't trained in a long time,

257
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
so she's not as good at it right now. But Wei-wei, you're really good at it.

258
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,900
So can you find some time privately

259
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,400
to give her some pointers so that she can successfully pass the trial period and join the team?

260
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,900
Why?

261
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,900
Because she's my elementary school classmate, and she was also my assistant for a short time.

262
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,600
I know, she can be frustrating sometimes,

263
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
but I think she's quite talented.

264
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,300
If her career stops here, I think it'd be really regretful. Right?

265
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
It's like this. The team has its own rules.

266
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,700
As the captain, I can't give anyone special treatment.

267
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,400
If Tang Xue is as good as you say, she'll be able to stay in the team on her own.

268
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Wei-wei, what's wrong?

269
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,400
We're all using matching water bottles now.

270
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm so tired from practice.

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,400
Recently, my knees have been hurting. They hurts a lot.

272
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
This side.

273
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,700
What's wrong?

274
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,000
Wait!

275
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,700
How come your bottle is heat-insulating?

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Look at him. He's so small and weak. Not like us, all strong and sturdy.

277
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm weak?

278
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,200
He's weak?

279
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,500
Compared to you, I am weak.

280
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,700
Wei-wei, you got a new phone?

281
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,200
All your teammates use pink or white phones,

282
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,100
how come yours is such a dark color?

283
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,000
It's cool. Suits our Brother Wei well and I have the same one.

284
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,110
Our team members all have the same phone. I've grabbed the wrong one many times already.

285
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,380
Why not put on a phone case?

286
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,310
Yeah!

287
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm too lazy. I can used that time to practice skating.

288
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,240
Yeah, that's true.

289
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,670
Anyway, Brother Wei is our XDragons team's coolest lightning bolt on the ice.

290
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,340
Don't give me a dunce's cap! You'll be the first one my lightning strikes.

291
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,920
Ah right. I remembered I need to do something so I'm going to leave now.

292
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,700
Brother Wei, about that situation, just pretend you didn't hear me say anything.

293
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,930
I'm going.

294
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,770
Going now, Brother Wei.

295
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,760
You're mad at Bing-bing? What happened?

296
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,060
He wanted me to help Tang Xue so she can stay in the team.

297
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,370
Then, help her. Aren't you the team captain?

298
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,920
You've trained Hongshuang, Big Xiao Yuan, right?

299
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,270
Why are you mad?

300
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,830
How can it be the same?

301
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,800
Hongshuang and the other are well-qualified teammates, helping them goes without saying.

302
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,250
Tang Xue didn't even reach the standard and her score is far behind.

303
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,130
First, she needs to prove that she qualifies for the team so I can approve of her.

304
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,580
What is Li Yubing's intention?

305
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,100
Just because they were elementary school classmate and she was his assistant for a few days,

306
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,770
so he cares this much?

307
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,070
What is this? He also wants me to give her special treatment?

308
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,740
I'm giving her special treatment...

309
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,770
I don't have that time to waste.

310
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,510
Wei-wei!

311
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,610
Are you really mad at being asked to give special treatment,

312
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,380
or are you mad because of Tang Xue?

313
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,160
Does Brother Wei like me?

314
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,480
Don't joke around.

315
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,290
Okay, Coach Wang.

316
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,680
Thank you for asking.

317
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm going to tell Yubing now. Okay, okay.

318
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,300
Manager Ma?

319
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,800
My Ice God, my Ice God, my Ice God.

320
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,250
Yubing, you've been chosen for the national youth team

321
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,010
to attend the U20 Hockey Invitational.

322
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,020
Seriously?

323
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,080
Absolutely. The national youth team's Coach Wang just called me.

324
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,920
- He has high expectations for you.
- That's great!

325
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,770
Then, go back and be well prepared.

326
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,070
You'll have to leave this weekend.

327
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,500
No problem.

328
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,660
Oh right, Manager Ma! I need to ask you something.

329
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,060
Do you have tickets for Wu Dajing's speech?

330
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,680
Yes, I do. Only two left.

331
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,800
Yu Yan took them.

332
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,420
I'll go get ready.

333
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,700
Eat them. The noodles are getting cold.

334
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,930
Your bowl isn't heat-insulated?

335
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,720
You don't have a fever. Are there bowls that are heat-insulated?

336
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,420
- You have something on your mind?
- No.

337
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,920
If you have anything on your mind,

338
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,630
the best way is to put it to action. Don't keep it bottled up.

339
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,450
Just like the noodles in front of you.

340
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,040
It will become soggier the more you leave it out.

341
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,430
You won't even be able to mix it well.

342
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,570
I'll prepare another bowl for you.

343
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,320
Yu Yan?

344
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,190
Yu Yan?

345
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,500
It's that room over there, sir.

346
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,670
Okay.

347
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,900
How is it?

348
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,550
You fixed this?

349
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,130
Yes.

350
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,930
Are you new? Remember to wear a uniform when you're on the job.

351
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,650
Sir, sorry for troubling you. You can go back now. It's okay.

352
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,100
Okay then.

353
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,950
Wei-wei likes cool things.

354
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,380
She also likes speed.

355
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,750
I wanted to go see my idol to help motivate myself

356
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,010
and tell myself that my idol's not as far away as I think.

357
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,860
I want to buy two entrance tickets for Wu Dajing's speech.

358
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,350
Urgent. I'll wait online.

359
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,230
Entrance tickets to Wu Bajing's speech.

360
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,160
¥300 for two. A small discount is possible.

361
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,860
Is two hundred okay?

362
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,120
Bro, are you kidding me?

363
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,020
Thank you. You were like Wonder Woman just now.

364
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,770
When did you get so good at talking?

365
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,060
What happened? Three gold medals and six trophies.

366
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,660
Did you get the ¥40,000 by pawning those things?

367
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,930
I just wanted to help you.

368
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,730
I'm really grateful you wanted to help me but I will also have a burden.

369
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,690
When you sold these things,

370
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,980
didn't you feel sorry for all the effort you paid all these years?

371
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,780
What is that?

372
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,000
This is ¥40,000.

373
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,830
Hurry and take it. Get the things back.

374
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,970
Where did you get all the money?

375
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,900
Li Yubing suddenly got stung by his conscience and terminated the contract.

376
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,040
Also, he canceled my penalty so I'm free.

377
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,240
Then, he didn't make anything hard for you, did he?

378
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,360
Nope. His behavior is quite good.

379
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,930
Then, that's good.

380
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,170
I just got into the short track speed skating team and–

381
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,170
I was a bit busy so this was the only time I had to give it back to you.

382
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,750
You got into the short track speed skating team?

383
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,010
I also have to thank you for your encouragement last time.

384
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,610
But the first month is a trial period.

385
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,870
A good start is halfway to success.

386
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,490
After a month, I don't know

387
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,460
whether I can beat Zhang Yuewei?

388
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,860
Here.

389
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,420
How did you know I was trying to find tickets?

390
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,400
It's good you like them.

391
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,640
- Let's clean up.
- Okay.

392
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,500
I'm sitting at table number four. I'm wearing a white shirt.

393
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,110
Table number four?

394
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,590
Hello?

395
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,730
Hello.

396
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,520
- Ice God!
- You're Qiu-qiu (ball-ball)?

397
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,730
Actually, my name is Qiu Qiu.

398
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,410
Classmates usually call me Qiu-qiu.

399
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,500
Did you forget I brought you breakfast before?

400
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,160
Ah, I remember it.

401
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,590
I didn't expect to see my dream man while delivering tickets.

402
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,870
If I knew it was you then I wouldn't have arranged to meet here.

403
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,270
Oh right! Classmate, weren't we suppose to discuss the tickets?

404
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,560
Right, right, ticket. You don't know

405
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,600
how hard it was to get these entrance tickets for Wu Dajing? If I wasn't in the student council,

406
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,460
I couldn't even get them.

407
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,190
It was two hundred, right? I'll transfer them now.

408
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,180
No, you can't.

409
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,990
What happened?

410
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,800
I'll give these to you.

411
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,930
How could I do that?

412
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,250
I don't want money.

413
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,690
But I want something else.

414
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,530
Something else?

415
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,770
You need to smile.

416
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,590
More genuine. Heart.

417
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,450
Eggplant!
(T/N: Chinese version of "cheese" when taking a picture.)

418
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,290
Put your hands up a bit. One, two, three!

419
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,560
"Ice and Snow Carnival Planning Competition"?

420
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,910
Didn't you want to go see sloths?

421
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,310
I brought you the flier so you could sign up.

422
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,990
Bro, you call this a flier? This is a poster!

423
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,310
Did you bring the poster because you didn't want anyone else to sign up?

424
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,810
What are you talking about?

425
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,560
- Even if they signed up, they wouldn't win anyway.
- Why?

426
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,650
Because... Because you have me.

427
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,320
You?

428
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,590
Tomorrow's the deadline. It's best if I go ask Master Tang for help.

429
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:16,650
Don't. Master Tang is busy with both training and classes right now. When does she have time to help us?

430
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,960
That's true.

431
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,090
I've already got it all figured out. Tonight, I'll pull an all-nighter and help you finish it.

432
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,400
I won't sleep until I get it done. Really.

433
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,600
You're quite enthusiastic about this.

434
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,730
Then let's do this. My cousin has not been home recently. Let's go to her apartment and work there all night.

435
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:41,590
Just us two? Is that okay?

436
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,870
What's wrong with two sisters going to pull an all-nighter together? Isn't that very normal?

437
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,700
- Xia Menghuan.
- Don't be so mean, I'm scared.

438
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,600
Well, let's go eat. Don't be hungry.

439
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,640
Tang Xue! Oh, sorry, I got the wrong person.

440
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,370
Young man, you've been drinking this bottle of water for over half an hour.

441
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,980
Are you going to throw it away or not?

442
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,420
Do you want this bottle? I'll finish it, I'll finish it.

443
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,970
Thank you for the ticket!

444
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,300
Thanks for helping me fix my bookshelf, and for helping me get my gold medals back.

445
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,190
Of course, we have to get them back. If we didn't, I'd feel so bad.

446
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,460
We're here.

447
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,440
Then Friday afternoon, let's meet at the hall where the speech is happening.

448
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,090
Get some rest.

449
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,040
This is a true goddess.

450
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,220
I wonder if she'll like it.

451
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,640
[Glory Ice Summit, Keynote Speaker: Wu Dajing]

452
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,280
I already got the tickets, I should still go.

453
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,790
Huan-huan, your cousin's flat is quite nice.

454
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,860
"Hockey Tournament's opening show."

455
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,890
How can I make it more creative?

456
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,100
Huan-huan, drink a glass of milk.

457
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,070
Put it there and I'll drink it myself.

458
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,760
You can't do that. You have your hands full, I'll use my hands to feed you.

459
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,360
It's hot.

460
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,360
The ice in most indoor skating rinks is quite thin.

461
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,910
We can add some designs in there.

462
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,050
Or adding some relief sculptures... Why not just make it 3D?

463
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,450
Right? It'll look more realistic.

464
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,980
Xiao Xia, here! You've used your eyes too much.

465
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,040
- What?
- Steam eye mask. Slowly. Lie down.

466
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,650
Rest a bit.

467
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,370
How about adding some fish elements?

468
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,880
Adding some colors?

469
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,940
Xiao Xia! Come on, foot bath.

470
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,620
This time, I prepared a pure Chinese medicine foot bath for you.

471
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,710
I learned massage techniques online. Let me take off your shoes.

472
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,130
- What?
- Foot bath.

473
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,950
- I don't want a foot bath.
- Just do it, come on.

474
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,920
I don't want to–

475
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,840
Classmate Liao Zhenyu, I asked you to come so we can come up with ideas. Okay?

476
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,570
If you don't have any ideas, hurry up and leave; go wherever you want.

477
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,350
My head is hurting from all this thinking.

478
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,660
Xiao Xia, don't be scared. I'll protect you.

479
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,680
I'm not scared at all.

480
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,650
What's that noise?

481
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,080
- Let me take a look.
- Don't go! It's dangerous. Dangerous!

482
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,040
It's just a small moth. You're that scared?

483
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,180
Who's scared? It's just a small moth!

484
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,220
Poor guy.

485
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,850
- Is it dead?
- Crashed into the lampshade and died.

486
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,300
A flying moth darts into the flame. Don't you think it signifies great love?

487
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,460
Seriously? You see love in everything.

488
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,280
Why isn't it great? Think about it.

489
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,960
This flying moth used its life, right? To–

490
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,450
Enough, can't you talk about something serious?

491
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,980
Okay.

492
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,950
Through this butterfly, I'm thinking...

493
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,260
Can we turn the ice world into a butterfly valley?

494
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,380
A sharp contrast between the cold ice and the tropical butterfly.

495
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,910
Think about it. When you are skating on ice,

496
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,700
it's as if thousands of butterflies are flying beneath you.

497
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,980
- How would you feel?
- That would definitely be beautiful!

498
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,130
- Right.
- Your idea is passable, you're quite smart.

499
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,910
Thanks to your guidance.

500
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,400
Say, can we dye the ice?

501
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,960
Have the entire ice be turned into a blue color.

502
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,890
And then we'll add some flowers.

503
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,860
Suppose you are skating on blue ice,

504
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,470
isn't it like walking on the ocean?

505
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,880
♫ The sunlight shines on the ends of your hair ♫

506
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,320
♫ Coke has too many bubbles but coffee is too plain ♫

507
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,260
♫ Crystal sugar paired with snow pear is perfect ♫

508
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,810
♫ I hear the melodious piano playing notes of your smile ♫

509
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,270
♫ Take all your worries and toss them far away ♫

510
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:10,180
Finished!

511
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,870
I'll get some water for you.

512
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,960
Huan-huan, really, it was a wise idea to stay at your cousin's place.

513
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,000
Or else, we definitely wouldn't have been able to finish on time. Here, Huan-huan, have some water.

514
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,130
Huan-huan?

515
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,740
- Sloths.
- Huan-huan?

516
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,460
♫ The guitars sound is alarming, the fallen flowers
twirl in the wind ♫

517
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,590
♫ The bells under the roof sway the heartbeats that meet ♫

518
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,710
So pretty.

519
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:22,430
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

520
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:29,770
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

521
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:36,470
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

522
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:42,730
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

you are protecting ♫

528
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,940

it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

529
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,850
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

530
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:24,830
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

it must be destiny ♫
