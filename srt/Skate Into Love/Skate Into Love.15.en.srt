I bought a pair of Air Jordans recently. I think they're a little small.

It looks like they might fit your feet. Why don't you wear them?

Me... Me wear them? That's not a good idea, is it?

48
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,940
Maybe that's true. I can give them to someone else.

Don't let one's own fertile water flow into another's field. It is better to accept deferentially than to decline courteously. Thank you. (T/N: idiom - keep the good things within the family)

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,220
The main thing is to thank you last time for helping me connect with the video.

51
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,770
These shoes are beautiful. You don't need to thank me.

52
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,990
Right. Why are you helping me?

53
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,640
Do you want to hear the truth?

54
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,390
As for the truth,

55
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,980
I used to be irritated by you.

56
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,320
But... But that was because you used to always bully our Master Tang.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,770
Later, I realized that toward Master Tang

58
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,850
your attitude changed. It's not the same anymore.

59
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,950
I now think that you guys are super compatible.

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,230
Why?

61
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,060
Combative spirit. Because you can always evoke Master Tang's combative spirit.

62
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,890
A practical example. Master Tang was constantly fighting with you,

63
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,370
she then returned to short track speed skating and found her dream again.

64
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,830
What does this mean? This means that you can make Master Tang better.

65
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,960
I didn't think you were so magnanimous.

66
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,100
You don't have the least bit of self-interest.

67
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,680
Self-interest? Actually, I do have a little of that.

68

- If I tell you, don't be mad.
- Go ahead.

I used to joke around like this with Xia Menghuan. The two of us made a bet.

That's the whole truth.

73
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,930
So... So you don't need to thank me so much. If I help you, I'm helping myself, too. You even gave me Air Jordans.

74
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,860
- I actually feel a little embarrassed.
- Okay, enough. I understand.

75
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,890
But back to the original topic. I sincerely think that you and Master Tang are extremely suited for one another.

76

But you told me smartphones were useless because there are too many functions.

It's still very convenient.

156
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,920
Yan-yan, Mommy came to tell you

157
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,930
that your next mission is very important. You need to participate in the National Championships.

158
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,990
We need to be well-prepared.

159
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,740
Mommy found a really good choreographer in Canada.

160
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,480
I want him to choreograph a routine for you.

161
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,840
It just so happens that Toronto has a Grand Prix that you can enter.

162
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,860
It will be a chance to prepare for a National Championships participation.

Coach Jin supported this.

164
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm here to thoroughly discuss this with him.

165
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,060
I have to go to Canada?

Hey, Xiao Jin.

169
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,760
Why are you here? To see Yan-yan?

170
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,660
Yeah. Xiao Jin, Yan-yan has troubled you. Right?

171
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,400
Right. I went to see Old Coach.

172
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,060
He thought of you a lot and wanted me to give you this special local product.

173
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,270
To be honest, I feel ashamed.

174
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,290
I haven't seen Old Coach for a long time. Thank you, Senior Sister.

175
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,720
Yan-yan, go to class. Mommy will talk to your coach.

176
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,260
Xiao Jin, how is Yan-yan's training coming along?

177
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,850
Not bad.

178

At his age,

179
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,510
he's top-notch in both technique and artistic levels.

180
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,060
It's just...

181
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,580
these days, he's a bit distracted in training.

182
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,460
It also feels a bit like rebelling.

183
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,700
I'm afraid if this continues, it'll affect the National Championship.

184

This is very important for us.

If at that time she meets someone of the opposite sex,

This creates the feeling of love.

At the place she jumped into the ocean, there's always a sea bird that would call out "ge, ge."

386
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,830
The villagers thought it was transformed by Ou'er, so they called the bird Hai Ou (seagull).

387
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,130
Hai Ou and Hai Ou sound similar. So it eventually became Hai Ou (seagull) as they started calling it more.

471
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,930
Did she tell you to say that to me? Can you please tell her

472
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,480
that I can understand her doing this, but I–

473
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,010
No. Tang Xue, Xia Menghuang, Liao Zhenyu,

474
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,290
and Li Yubing went out to hang out. They'll come back tomorrow.

475
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,900
Li Yubing?

476
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,710
You can call her.

477
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,300
Okay. Thank you. I'll come by later.

478
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,510
Are you sure Manager Ma is rewarding you?

479
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,730
Hi! Hello, everybody!

480
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,810
Welcome. Hurry and come. Hello!

481
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,900
Hurry and come. Hi, everyone!

482
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,020
Welcome, welcome. Look around as you please. Don't need to be courteous.

483
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,920
I've been old friends with your coach for over 10 years.

484
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,850
Play however you like.

485
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,900
Are you sure this is The Black Pearl?

486
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,340
- Are you sure you are Ice God, Li Yubing?
- I am.

487
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,240
I'm not wrong either. The Black Pearl. How can I be wrong? Come, Pearl.

488
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,910
Go greet your brothers and sisters. Come on.

489
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,540
Hello, Brothers. Hello, Sisters.

490
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,360
The name truly matches the reality, Black Real Pig.
(T/N: real pig and pearl sound the same)

491
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,230
I think I brought my swimsuit and sunscreen for nothing.

492
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:04,310
What do you mean for nothing? We can use it. You're showing so much of your leg, I'll spray some for you.

493
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,490
- I understand. Lovers. You guys are couples, right?
- No.

494
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,520
Great. Great! The Black Pearl fits you guys perfectly.

495
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:20,130
Going out to the ocean has to be romantic. The Black Pearl is perfect for romantic couples.

496
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,400
Here. I can't let you guys come for nothing. Let me tell you all.

497
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,220
I'll teach you what "romantic" means.

498
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,060
♫ As long as you smile ♫

499
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:38,600
♫ Holding your hand, we watch the sunrise and sunset together ♫

500
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,930
♫ Strolling on the beach, we count each of the waves ♫

501
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,110
♫ Watching the meteors gorgeously streak across the sky ♫

502
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:51,710
♫ You’ll keep me company to travel around the world
to every corner ♫

503
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,080
♫ Leaning against your side, we’ll sing love songs ♫

504
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,810
♫ Fairy tales and love stories all belong to us ♫

505
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:18,400
♫ You gently touch the ends of my hair, the contact
makes me infatuated ♫

506
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,970
♫ The time we agreed on is never late ♫

507
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,180
Little piggy!

508
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,650
Although this boat is not as luxurious as a big yacht,

509
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,090
but it has a real pig. Look how happy they look.

510
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,160
Hey. Is that the North Star?

511
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,960
I still remember someone telling me that's the direction towards home.

512
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,300
What are you looking at?

513
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:05,230
North Star. You can find the way back home that way.

514
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,270
After all this time, you still remember?

515
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,040
Of course.

516
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,510
That year, I wanted to be like a swordsman from the martial arts movies

517
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,210
and travel the four corners of the world.

518
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,190
But I had to have you to drag me down.

519
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,590
You were the one who dragged me.

520
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,760
Let's go. I'll bring you to travel the world. Let me tell you! I brought chocolate,

521
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,930
gummies, kinder eggs, yakult, and this.

522
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:39,590
This is my red envelope from this year, but I only have this much left from spending.

523
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:45,250
But it should last a month. In the past, we spent yours. From now on, I'll pay.

524
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,450
- Can we not go?
- No.

525
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,670
Let's go.

526
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:22,610
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

527
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:30,030
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

528
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:36,660
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

529
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,880
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

530
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,120
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

531
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,470
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

532
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:03,060
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

533
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,890
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

534
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,870
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

535
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,170
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

536
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,040
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

537
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,040
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

538
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,540
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

539
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,880
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

540
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,420
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

541
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:50,910
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

542
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:56,900
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

543
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:04,430
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

544
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:10,920
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

545
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,950
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

546
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:23,100
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

547
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:30,070
♫ it is the signal you are giving me ♫

548
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:36,330
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

549
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:43,840
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

550
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,900
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

551
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:57,370
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

552
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:03,710
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫
