[Episode 13]

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Li Yubing.

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Coach, why are you here?

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,600
I heard you weren't doing so great in the national youth team. I came to see you.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Did you come all the way from Lincheng just to see me?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Yeah,

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,000
I just couldn't put my mind to rest.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
I watched your game.

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Your main problem is...

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that you only rely on yourself and don't trust your teammates.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,400
You can't do this in a team-based sport.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,700
Let's do this, I don't have much time to spend here.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Come sit. I'll tell you more.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Come over here.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,200
I've looked into all of your teammates and their traits,

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
so that you can learn how to work better with them.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Let's look at Song Anjie. You are both centers.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,700
But his specialty is that he can see everything in his periphery.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,600
He sees everything that's happening on the ice that other people don't notice.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,400
So it's not unreasonable that Coach Wang picked him as the team captain instead of you.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
- Look here.
- Coach.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you stay up all night again?

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
I'm still young, it's not a big deal.

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,100
But your hair, there are some white hairs—

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
These white hairs were already there.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
Let's talk about Cai Lei.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,000
Even though he's a wingman, his blocking skills are really strong.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,200
He can block from the left or right side,

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,400
or from the center, so all you have to do is...

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,700
I'll head back now. Good luck!

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,500
- Coach, take care.
- Make sure you remember everything I told you.

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,800
I got it. Have a safe trip back.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,200
Oh right! I almost forgot.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Zhao Yuewei and Tang Xue knew I was coming to Harbin to see you, so they gave me these to give to you.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Here, this one, too.

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
- I'll head back now.
- Okay.

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Good luck!

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,400
Coach, I won't let you down.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,900
It looks just like her.

57
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,820
I will always be by your side.

58
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Our school is having a school-wide blackboard poster contest.

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,700
Next Monday, the teachers will take turns evaluating the blackboards for each class.

60
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,300
Li Yubing, you're our class president.

61
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,900
So you will take Tang Xue to represent our class in this contest, okay?

62
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,300
I believe you guys can definitely get first place.

63
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Teacher, don't worry.

64
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,200
I will work with Li Yubing and do a good job on this project. He always listens to me.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,100
Teacher, I can...

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,100
do it on my own.

67
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,800
The goal of this contest is to encourage teamwork.

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,400
I believe that if the two of you work together, you can come up with a better idea.

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,500
I have an idea.

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,400
It's fine. I can do it by myself.

71
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,760
Even if she says her idea, there's no point.

72
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,500
Tang Xue!

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,200
All you do is cause trouble.

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
You drew it pretty well,

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,600
but there's nothing special about it.

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Tomorrow is the evaluation, what should we do?

77
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,930
Want to hear my idea now?

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
Did you go pick up trash?

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
What trash?

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
You have to be original to capture people's attention.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Who says you can only draw with chalk on a blackboard?

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,700
It's very creative. How did you guys think of this?

87
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,800
You have to be original to capture people's attention.

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,200
This is... what Tang Xue said.

89
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,200
She has her strengths, too. I should have trusted her.

You're making that old mistake again.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,700
Hello? I received your picture.

93
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,600
Thanks. I understand your message.

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,100
As long as you understand.

95
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,000
But weren't you the one who told me to play like this?

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Anyway, you... score more goals... pass more people, score more goals, that's all you need to do.

97
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,400
What I meant by that was for you to try your best and lead the team to victory.

98
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,300
I didn't mean for you to play the hero and make the team lose.

99
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,000
You're right.

100
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,800
But I took your words at face value.

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,700
Aren't you supposed to be a top student? What kind of comprehension do you have?

102
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
In the next game, give it your all.

103
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
I will.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Also, you drew a dog head on the back of the picture, what does it mean?

105
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,600
It means that if you still don't figure out your issue,

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,100
I'll beat up your dog head.

107
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,580
All right, I know what to do now.

108
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
How have things been over there recently?

109
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,400
Today, we did team performance evaluations. My time improved by 5 seconds.

110
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm only behind Ling Hongshuang by 0.4 seconds.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,100
Coach Chu even complimented me for improving so quickly.

112
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Is that so? Not bad.

113
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Is it snowing where you are? Can you show me?

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,900
Wait up. I'll show you with a video call.

115
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,400
Bye-bye.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll show you what heavy snow really looks like.

117
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900

It looks so warm over there.

121
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Are you dumb? You're seeing it through a screen, of course, it feels warm.

122

Seems like his phone died from the cold.

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,900
What the! Now I know what they mean when they say "freezing the battery life to death".

127
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,400
I should focus on my own matters.

128
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,700
Sister Huan.

129
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Which social practice is the easiest way to get school credit?

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,300
I signed up for farm practice.

No problem.

133
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
You haven't left yet?

134
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,700
I just finished extra training.

135
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,200
By the way,

136
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,360
in our last game, actually,

137
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
it was my fault.

138
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm glad to hear you say that.

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,100
Every team needs a star player,

140
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,200
but more importantly, we're a team.

141
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I know.

142
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,600
I was too overconfident of myself.

143
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
It's okay.

144
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,900
It's your first time in the national youth team.

145
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,800
It's understandable. Everyone wants to show what they can do.

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're surprisingly good at counseling people.

147
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,040
If Coach Wang finds out, you're dead.

148
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,590
When I first entered the national youth team, I was more eager to show off than you were.

149
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,700
All I thought about was getting MVP and such.

150
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,200
But the team would always lose.

151
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
After a while, I realized my problem.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,200
As athletes, what's our end goal?

153
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Winning. Helping the team gain victory.

154
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,290
So in a team,

155
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,400
whether you're a star player or a side player,

156
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,600
as long as you can help the team win,

157
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,700
that's what makes a good athlete.

158
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
Don't you agree?

159
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,600

Don't you think they match? A talented man and a beautiful woman. I'll give them my blessing.

320
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,530
The girl I like is involved in a rumor with someone else.

321
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,890
So painful.

322
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,160
Be confident in yourself.

323
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,890
This is not a big deal.

324
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,980
If you want one thing to succeed, the most important thing is

325
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,090
to be confident in yourself.

326
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,420
But I have confidence in myself right now.

327
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,990
The reason is that you aren't able to deal with feelings that well.

328
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,020
You don't have enough experience.

329
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,500
You can enrich yourself with theoretical basis and then integrate it into your practice.

330
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,000
You're so understanding!

331
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,810
Coach Wang.

332
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,380
Yubing, come here.

333
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,230
It's like this, I'm going back to Lincheng tomorrow.

334
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,550
I'm here today to thank you for guiding me.

335
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,450
I said it before, no one can help you change.

336
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,600
You can only depend on yourself.

337
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,240
Yubing, you did it.

338
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,160
You realized what's most important in a team.

339
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,420
The trip was not made in vain.

340
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,030
Hopefully, we'll see you next year in the national youth team again.

341
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,280
Good luck!

342
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,020
Now that we're leaving, I actually hate parting from here.

343
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,370
Li Yubing, I'm already looking forward to battling with you next year.

344
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,010
I'm looking forward to secretly drinking a beer with you next year.

345
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,600
Tang Xue, I'm coming back.

346
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,300
When are you going back to Lincheng with your girlfriend? That little flower she sent.

347
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,920
That wasn't my girlfriend yesterday.

348
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,000
You have high standards. That girl was pretty good!

349
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,350
Pretty, elegant, confident.

350
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,840
What? Is there someone better?

351
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,180
Tang Xue. You don't remember me?

352
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,910
We were deskmates in elementary school.

353
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,850
We were so close at that time.

354
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,990
Back then, I was your boss. Now, you are mine.

355
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,590
This is called "The fragrance remains in the hand that gives the rose."

356
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,760
Yes.

357
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,820
Master Tang, what is the matter with you?

358
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,650
Why are you eating so much?

359
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,620
I just finished training and I'm super hungry.

360
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,090
Master Tang, we haven't had a meal together in a while.

361
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,560
I thought you had abandoned us.

362
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,120
Aren't I fighting to conquer the world for you two?

363
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,290
Oh, is that so? Then, how is it going?

364
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,080
I just started.

365
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,540
It's okay, Master Tang. You are the chosen one.

366
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,600
Oh right! Did that Wang Feng contact you yet?

367
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,120
Next week is our high school classmate reunion, are you going?

368
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,970
Yes, I'm going. I haven't seen them since graduation.

369
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,580
I have to go.

370
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,500
- Then let's go too.
- Okay.

371
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,570
- Lets go home.
- Okay.

372
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,700
When did you two start having a home?

373
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,640
- Home for Homeless Babies. Let's go.
- Home for Homeless Babies.

374
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,890
Bye-bye!

375
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,630
Who exactly is the one abandoning the other?

376
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,190
[Female Dormitory]

377
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,860
A single flower and Li Yubing?

378
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,800
♪ Insisting on waiting for the snow to melt ♪

379
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,300
♪ and the light overflows my heart for us to fall in love ♪

380
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,600
♪ Loving you not only just once, ♪

381
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,070
♪ dreaming not only just once ♪

382
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,030
♪ Not simply just stopping on the fingertips ♪

383
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,720
♪ Insisting on waiting ♪

384
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,420
This is a soul baptism.

385
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,570
This is a pillage of the soul.

386
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,950
Looks like Master Tang was serious about going to compete.

387
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,090
Let's go for a walk.

388
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,760
The camera is from such a long distance, everyone looks the same,

389
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,570
yet you can tell right away it's him?

390
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:01,190
In my eyes, he always has a dog head.

391
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,200
Yu Yan, Tang Xue signed up to participate in the Campus Singing Competition.

392
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,460
This is her last chance to get credits.

393
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,760
Otherwise, it can affect her graduation.

394
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,450
Do you have any good ideas?

395
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,240
For example, being her co-star?

396
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Co-star?

397
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,560
You're really willing to be my co-star?

398
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,890
That's great.

399
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,790
You learned to dance before.

400
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,990
If you become Master Tang's co-star, we'll definitely win!

401
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,910
That's a given.

402
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,640
I don't think that will do. Yu Yan is normally very busy with his own practice, right?

403
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,840
What's that have to do with you?

404
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,930
Master Tang, I heard the participants this time

405
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,950
are all professionals.

406
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,190
Like us amateurs, we definitely wouldn't win.

407
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,360
But, we have Yu Yan so it will be different.

408
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,900
Let's put in all our efforts and aim for the Most Popular prize.

409
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,150
If Yu Yan participates, we'll win.

410
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,730
Won't that hinder your own practice?

411
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,050
If it can help you, it's good.

412
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,170
Then, we'll choose a song first this afternoon.

413
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,630
Here!

414
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,220
Let's go!

415
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,460
What style would you like to see?

416
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,400
I'll take a look first.

417
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,430
Are you choosing a necklace for your girlfriend?

418
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,000
The leaf-shaped necklace sells well.

419
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,980
Most girls like it.

420
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,630
Girl?

421
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,310
She's not a girl, she's a man.
(T/N: he meant that as a tomboy)

422
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,470
Take a look at this one.

423
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,590
Not that one, I'll take a look at that one.

424
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,630
Luckily, I received this month's allowance.

425
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,690
Tang Xue signed up to participate in the Campus Singing Competition. Yu Yan is the co-star.

426
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,850
As your friend, I welcome you to come back and join the competition.

427
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,140
Sir?

428
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,610
I want this one, wrap it up.

429
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,060
Okay, wait a second.

430
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,600
Look. Look at your Zhou Ran.

431
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,820
Standing so close.

432
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,630
Easy. Look.

433
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,630
Everything is foam, just a moment of fireworks.

434
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,420
Pretty good.

435
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,520
Look. They are almost stuck together. I'm telling you there's nothing going on between them.

436
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,520
- They met on accident.
- Enough. Li Yubing and her are not the same types.

437
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,220
Let's go. Let's pick up Li Yubing.

438
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,040
- Let's go.
- We have time.

439
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,760
Bing-bing!

440
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,390
Not bad, you became an overnight celebrity with this game.

441
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,010
You rushed out of Lincheng and into the world.

442
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,400
- Stop, stop, stop.
- I'm so jealous.

443
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,640
Let me tell you. The reason why I became like this is...

444
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,490
is because...

445
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,320
I have Brother Wei's personal supervision.

446
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,710
You're the best!

447
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,610
Does it look like her?

448
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,590
It does look like her, right?

449
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,440
I gave him a present, wouldn't this be a return present?

450
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,880
Scared me, good thing you found it.

451
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,890
This is for me, right?

452
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,950
Snowflake? For Wei-wei?

453
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,260
Does this type of item look like something for a brother?

454
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,420
Which girl is it for?

455
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,240
Let's go.

456
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,390
Hey! I'm asking you a question. What kind of attitude is that?

457
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:15,430
Shouldn't we go out and celebrate because of your win?

458
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,250
Another day. I have something to do today.

459
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,260
Bing-bing, that's a little excessive.

460
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,810
Where's our present?

461
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,200
I already prepared them for you. This whole box is full of Harbin sausages.

462
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,020
Let's go. Help me load the car.

463
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,530
Sausage?

464
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,530
Where are you?

465
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,910
Beiyuan Building 306. In the middle of rehearsing.

466
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm leaving.

467
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,030
Bing-bing, why are you leaving when you just got back?

468
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,270
I already told you I have something to do. I'm meeting Tang Xue.

469
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,760
Looks like Tang Xue is getting more important to you.

470
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,690
It can't be too fast,

471
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,140
or you won't be able to dance.

472
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,950
Don't worry, I'll listen to you.

473
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,710
What a coincidence. Everyone is here.

474
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,780
Ice God, what a coincidence! Come in.

475
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,170
Come in, come in!

476
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,550
Master Tang failed her social practice class.

477
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,480
She wants to participate in the Campus Singing Competition to get credit.

478
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,690
Master Tang is singing and Yu Yan is dancing.

479
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,800
We're aiming to get the Most Popular prize.

480
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,010
When did you come back?

481
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,290
I sent you a Wechat message, you didn't reply.

482
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,870
I'm rehearsing with Yu Yan.

483
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,300
Have you even heard her sing? You agreed to dance with her so quickly.

484
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,930
It's because I already heard it, that's why I'm dancing on the side for her.

485
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,220
Ice God, you're already here. Take a seat and talk with us.

486
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,750
Wait, wait! Master Tang is busy rehearsing with Yu Yan right now.

487
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,620
No problem. I'm just checking if they need any help.

488
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,560
No need, no need. Thank you, thank you.

489
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,550
Wait!

490
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,150
We need you! You guys are the power collaboration!

491
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,200
Master Tang, you are a short track speed skater.

492
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,530
You're a hockey player and you're a figure skater. You three each represent something.

493
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,360
What is this called? It's called "Three Auspicious Ice."

494
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,330
You sing, you accompany with an instrument, and you accompany with dancing.

495
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,340
With your collaboration, you have the blessing of three lifetimes.

496
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,140
Master Tang, with Ice God's and Figure Skater Prince's popularity,

497
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,590
it's hard not to get the credit. With this plan,

498
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,550
you'll definitely get it. For sure!

499
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,000
But does our Ice God know how to play an instrument?

500
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,240
I know some, level ten in piano.

501
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,710
It's was only Li Yubing helping me write an essay,

502
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,450
because he writes well.

503
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,850
Why am I getting punished with cleaning?

504
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,730
There's still someone at school?

505
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,450
Tang Xue, maybe this way it'll be easier for you to win.

506
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,610
Why did you suddenly want to help me?

507
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,230
Because you helped me when I was in Harbin.

508
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,110
Makes sense.

509
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,140
I officially announce Bing Yu Xue's song...

510
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,430
is officially debuting!

511
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:39,200
♫ I really want to ask you, ”How are you?” ♫

512
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:45,200
♫ I couldn’t open my mouth to ask, I was too stupid ♫

513
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,030
How come your bottle is heat-insulating?

514
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,740
♫ It is too difficult to say ♫

515
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,630
♫ I can only secretly watch you on the side ♫

516
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,620
This... took quite a bit of effort, didn't it?

517
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,120
Stayed up all night, hand-gluing on each stone.

518
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,610
He's pretty impressive. If you see him, tell him thanks for me.

519
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,300
♫ Lying to myself and not daring to ask if I can still
say that sentence ♫

520
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:28,600
♫ I still love you ♫

521
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,980
- Wei-wei, are you okay?
- I'm good.

522
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,690
♫ Leaving behind the lonely me ♫

523
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:43,960
♫ Looking at the unfinished puzzle, I smiled ♫

524
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,650
If the person you like doesn't like you back, what do you do?

525
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,940
I will secretly watch over them.

526
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,820
If he doesn't feel the same way, why am I using so much effort?

527
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,290
- Goddess.
- Long time no see, Senior.

528
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:26,390
Junior ignores me, but I can always see you in my dreams.

529
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,280
Senior speaks so well.

530
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,380
I brought back this local product from Harbin.

531
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,630
If Senior doesn't mind, I'll give it to you.

532
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,550
I don't mind. I don't mind.

533
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,210
Right, Junior went to Harbin

534
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,570
just to send flowers to Bing-bing?

535
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,370
Of course not. I went to Harbin because of other business,

536
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,260
so I just conveniently went to support our classmate.

537
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,880
I knew it. The school news is nonsense.

538
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,530
Right, why did Junior call me out for?

539
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,750
It's not very important,

540
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,170
but I just signed up for the Campus Singing Competition.

541
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,690
I need a co-star to help me gain popularity.

542
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,780
So I was wondering if Senior could ask Ice God

543
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,760
to be my co-star?

544
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,000
This...

545
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,800
You're Ice God's roommate, will you not help me with this small task?

546
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,430
Of course not. You're just too late.

547
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,810
Li Yubing already agreed to be Tang Xue's co-star.

548
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,760
They already rehearsed it.

549
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,230
If Junior doesn't mind, I can be your co-star.

550
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,560
What can you do?

551
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:13,280
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

552
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,470
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

553
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:27,070
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

554
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:33,700
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

555
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,740
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

556
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:47,080
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

557
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:53,660
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

558
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,400
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

559
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,530
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

560
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,750
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

561
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,630
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

562
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:15,710
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

563
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:22,130
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

564
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:28,420
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

565
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:35,020
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

566
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:41,420
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

567
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,340
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

568
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:54,990
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

569
00:43:54,990 --> 00:44:01,480
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings, I couldn’t
believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

570
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,540
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

571
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:13,650
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

572
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:20,720
♫ it is the signal you are giving me ♫

573
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,950
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

574
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:34,320
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

575
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:40,520
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

576
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:47,820
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

577
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:54,120
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

578
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,260
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

579
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,010
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
