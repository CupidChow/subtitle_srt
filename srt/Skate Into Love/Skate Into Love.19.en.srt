You were right. She has potential.

If Tang Xue were to hear you say this, it'd make her really happy.

Even though there was an accident today, she's already demonstrated her potential.

Starting next month, the team will cover her training fees.

You don't need to subsidize it anymore.

Finally, I can breathe a little easier now.

87
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,910
What? You're not planning on telling her?

88
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,190
I think it would just make her feel burdened.

89

Let me take this call.

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,200
Hello?

91
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,140
Okay, I'll come now.

92
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,930
- Coach Chu, I have something to do. I'll get going.
- Okay, go ahead.

93
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,150
My training fees...

94
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, they were always paid by Li Yubing.

95
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,280
Even the shoes you're wearing right now were a gift from him.

96
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,830
Li Yubing has been looking after you this whole time.

97
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,870
He spent a lot of effort to convince me to let you join the short track speed skating team back then.

98
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,950
So the reason you were willing to give me a trial period

99
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,270
is also because of him?

100
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,300
Yes. It's good that you turned out to have potential.

101
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,230
Tang Xue!

102
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,250
Yan-yan, look at the time and you're still not asleep.

103
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,170
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

104
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,810
Can it be that training recently is too tiring? Fatigue leads to insomnia.

105
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,480
It's okay. I can cope.

106
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,100
Okay.

107
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,620
Here. I'll massage you so you can relax.

108
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,930
My goal for the National Championship this time is to surpass myself.

109
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,040
Then tell me the truth. You're doing everything you can to be hypercritical of yourself, is it–

110
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,990
It's to be the champion.

111
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,530
Mom...

112
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,140
Okay.

113
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,650
Whatever reasons you have, if you turn that into motivation for getting first place,

114
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:01,070
I'll support you. But can your body take it?

115
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,940
I can do it.

116
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,110
I want to rest, Mom.

117
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,620
Okay. I'll tuck you in.

118
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,270
Tang Xue, wait for me.

119
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,810
I'll transform into an even better version of myself to stand in front of you.

120
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,740
You're already really good.

121
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,960
Even Coach Chu noticed you.

122
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,540
You can count on one hand the number of people she pays attention to in LUU.

123
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,300
So your role right now is not only my assistant but also my personal training partner.

124
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,870
You shouldn't think about it too much. Just go back and sleep.

125
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,000
Maybe once you wake up, something good will happen.

126
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,430
I got onto the short track speed skating team.

127
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,060
It's really true that I would receive good news once I woke up.

128
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,650
You already did really well.

129
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,870
This is your medal.

130
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,900
As long as you don't admit defeat, you're the winner.

131
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,450
Li Yubing...

132
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Come on. Everyone raise their cups.

133
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,990

134
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,110
Congratulations!

135
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,130
Even though Tang Xue met with an accident today, you demonstrated great promise.

136
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,010
It also proved her ability.

137
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,060
So, as your coach, I'm very gratified.

138
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,570
I think we're the ones that should be thanking Coach Chu.

139
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,140
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here today.

140
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,430
So, let's let this juice substitute for wine

141
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,300
to toast Mommy Chu.

142
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
If you all don't hate me too much, that's enough for me.

143
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,540
- Thank you.
- You're worked hard.

144
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,540
Ability? Do I really have the ability?

145
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,800
I thought I was relying on my own strengths to get into the short track speed skating team.

146
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,270
But it was because of Li Yubing.

147
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,200
Here, Tang Xue. Let's toast.

148
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,110
You already did really well today.

149
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,600
Even though I didn't think you could do it before, today you made me look at you through new eyes.

150
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,010
That's right. If that accident hadn't happened,

151
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,410
you'd have sailed into 2nd place. I felt inadequate.

152
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,650
So, don't feel bad.

153
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,550
It's nothing to feel bad about.

154
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,110
What? Tang Xue, you're saying your stomach hurts?

155
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,370
Your health is essential. Don't force yourself if you're feeling bad.

156
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,330
Here, I'll take you back.

157
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,640
Let's go. Coach Chu, her stomach is not feeling well.

158
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,000
- We'll be going.
- Go ahead.

159
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,140
Bing-bing is just very warmhearted.

160
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,760
A table full of beautiful women, and there are only us two males here.

161
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,810
Are you bashful? Shy?

162
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,450
My stomach doesn't hurt.

163
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,730
I know.

164
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,950
Are you...

165
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,450
looking down on me?

166
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,050
What?

167
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,220
I know.

168
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,610
You know? What do you know?

169
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,170
Originally, I considered myself to be infallible.

170
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
That the brilliance of my great talent was hard to cover up.
(T/N: a ten thousand mile horse's glory cannot be covered up)

171
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,900
And it was finally discovered by Bole.
(T/N: legendary connoisseur of horses)

172

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,030
What?

174
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,460
Anyway, no matter what anyone says, I should thank you for helping me.

175
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,600
But why didn't you tell me you helped me pay the training fees?

176
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,190
Training fees? I don't know anything about what you just said.

177
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,820
I heard your discussion with Coach Chu.

178
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,650
I don't have a lot of money left at the end of this school term.

179
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,810
I'm transferring ¥3,000 for now, just accept it. I'll pay you back the rest slowly over time.

180
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,110
Accept it. Hurry up.

181
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,670
What are you doing? It's the end of the term. You already don't have a lot of money.

182
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,640
If you give this money to me, will you eat dirt?

183
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,350
I'll just eat dirt then. My heart is generous.

184
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,950
I never thought to ask about training fees.

185
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,330
I thought to get onto the team meant that the team would take care of all of it.

186
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,630
It's okay. You don't need to hurry.

187
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,630
We'll wait until the day you get first place, you can give the prize money to me.

188
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,180
What if I can't get first place, much less prize money?

189
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,030
You definitely can.

190
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,120
Why?

191
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,560
Probably because...

192
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,770
you have such an unyielding spirit.

193
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,830
I'm not that iron-willed and unyielding.

194
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,490
I know that. Actually, you've had it very difficult recently.

195
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,790
The training was so intense and you slacked off on so many classes.

196
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,070
You surely must have felt bad,

197
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,220
irritable, frustrated, afraid.

198
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,040
Okay. Thanks.

199
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,750
Then pledge to marry me.

200
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,560
Have you bought your ticket to go home?

201
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,700
Ticket?

202
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,050
Let's go back to Hucheng together. If you haven't already bought it, send me your ID number.

203
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,720

What are you smiling about? You don't like Li Yubing.

209
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,500
Impossible.

210
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,100
How could I like Li Yubing? Right?

211
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,630
What are you doing?

212
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,990
Is... Is there an earthquake? A fire?

213
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,510
I was trying to get tickets and the internet crashed.

214
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,970
No matter what difficulties you're encountering,

215
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,490
you have to cheer up. Good luck.

216
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,760
Master Tang, when are you going back to Hucheng? Shall we go together?

217
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,040
I have to do something with the team. I can't go back with you.

218
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Take good care of Sister Huan and that'll be enough.

219
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,640
You don't need to worry about me. Go home early.

220
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,580
Master Tang, I think you've abandoned me.

221
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,820
You are worth being abandoned.

You taught me what passion is. I'll never forget it.

Let's leave school together tomorrow.

320
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Okay.

321
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Are you saying it or not?

322
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,450
Since everyone is so happy today,

323
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,400
why don't we sing a song?

324
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,900
What do you want to hear? Choose anything!

325
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,100
Let's eat! Come on!

326
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,600
Huan-huan, you're really going back tomorrow? Why don't you stay a bit longer?

327
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,800
After all, once you go, we can only meet next year. Can't you stay for a few more days?

328
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,700
You really can say it.

329
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,800
There's only one month. It will pass quickly, all right?

330
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Let's walk another lap.

331
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,800
You've carved a path at the school gates.

332
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
Hug me.

333
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,500
Didn't Master Tang say there was something going on with the team?

334
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Is she the Monkey King? Changing 72 times a day.

335
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,800
I knew she was going today...

336
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,200
but I didn't know she was going together with Li Yubing.

337
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,600
She didn't tell me either. Being so sneaky. There's definitely something going on.

338
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Huan-huan, it looks like you're going to lose our bet.

339
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,300
You see, don't they look like a pair when they stand together?

340
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Huan-huan, don't get angry.

341
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,200
It's not like you don't know what conditions I wrote, right?

342
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,000
It's our last moments. Don't be angry.

343
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
[Lincheng -> Hucheng]

344
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
Let's sit here.

345
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Please move, please move.

346
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,400
Why isn't he talking to me? Should I start talking to him?

347
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900
- You...
- I...

348
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
You've finished transferring?

349
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I can finally focus on practicing short track speed skating. It's like a dream.

350
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,000
A few months ago, I thought I would never have a chance to get back on the ice.

351
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
Tang Xue will always shine.

352
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Jealous?

353
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,700
I'm jealous.

354
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,100
I remembered when I was in grade three, we learned skating together.

355
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,300
That time, you always talked about

356
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,000
bringing glory to the nation in the Winter Olympics.

357
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then, you joined a short track speed skating competition and got a prize.

358
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You bragged in front of me every day with a crappy certificate and bought a lot of capsule toys with the prize money.

359
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
It took you longer than a week to open them all.

360
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,400
That time, I swore I will also go to a hockey competition.

361
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,500
I'd get a better award than you so that you could shut up.

362
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,200
Don't mention the things from that time.

363
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,300
I can't help it. I have a good memory.

364
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,400
I remember everything, what I should and shouldn't.

365
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm just worried about what will happen if my parents know this after I go home.

366
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Aren't you the fearless Tang Xue?

367
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,200
But I'm afraid my parents will get sad.

368
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
It's okay.

369
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,500
No matter what, I'll stay beside you.

370
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,100
♫ I really want to ask you, ”How are you?” ♫

371
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:44,200
♫ I couldn’t open my mouth to ask, I was too stupid ♫

372
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:51,540
♫ It is too difficult to say, “Are you there?” ♫

373
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,420
♫ I can only secretly watch you on the side ♫

374
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,760
If you are ice skates, I'd gladly be the ice beneath you.

375
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,100
As long as I can support you, it's enough.

376
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:13,000
♫ I couldn’t believe in that split second, she who
believed you or I shed tears ♫

377
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,640
♫ Lying to myself and not daring to ask if I can still
say that sentence ♫

378
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,200
♫ Lying to myself and not daring to ask if I can still
say that sentence ♫

379
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,400
♫ I still love you ♫

380
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,450
Is there a ghost? I remember putting it over there.

381
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:56,370
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

382
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:03,780
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

383
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,370
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

384
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:16,310
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

385
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:22,790
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

386
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:30,220
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

387
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,690
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

388
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,500
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

389
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,550
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

390
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,450
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

391
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,020
Tang Xue.

392
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,100
This is our stop.

393
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,370
I'll go get our things.

394
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,180
Hurry up, don't block the way.

395
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,650
Sorry, sorry, excuse me. I'll wait for you outside.

396
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,340
Okay.

397
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,490
Young lady, your boyfriend is so good to you.

398
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,650
He's not my boyfriend.

399
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,330
And he's still so good to you?

400
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:21,380
When you fell asleep, he kept holding your head up with his hand.

401
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,840
After his left hand got tired, he switched to his right. Then when his right hand got tired, back to his left.

402
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,920
During this ride, who knows how many times he switched his hands?

403
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,420
He just kept holding your head up, he didn't even stop to drink water.

404
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,240
He was so careful not to wake you up.

405
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,450
- Xiao Xue!
- Dad!

406
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,600
Good daughter!

407
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,590
Hello, Uncle.

408
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,590
Xiao Xue, this is...

409
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,300
What do you mean? This is Li Yubing.

410
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,290
- Li Yubing?
- You don't remember?

411
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,870
Right. When we were little, Tang Xue and I were deskmates.

412
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,860
And now you guys are...

413
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,430
We came back together for winter break. Where are your parents?

414
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,850
I didn't ask them to come and pick me up. I'll just take a taxi.

415
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,180
We'll give you a ride. Let's go.

416
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,870
- Dad, let's go.
- Oh, okay.

417
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,090
Dad, when was the last time you saw Li Yubing? Was it at our elementary school graduation?

418
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,820
Yeah. Who knew

419
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,020
you guys would end up at LUU together?

420
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,860
Isn't it such a coincidence?

421
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:56,260
Xue'er, do you guys go to class together every day?

422
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,060
No, we're not even in the same department. He's in the sports college.

423
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,560
And he's playing ice hockey, not like me.

424
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,440
So when you guys aren't in class, do you get together and reminisce about the past?

425
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,670
He's too busy for that. He's the captain of the hockey team.

426
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,800
Not only does he have class, but he has to train.

427
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,900
And then he has hockey games. How would he have time to spend with me?

428
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,660
Where's Xiao Liao? He's in the same city as us. You usually come home together. How come I didn't see him with you?

429
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,470
He has a girlfriend now. He doesn't have time for me anymore. He hasn't hung out with me long ago!

430
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,230
That fast?

431
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,900
That's pretty impressive of Little Liao.

432
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:40,200
It's not easy for young people these days. Elementary, middle, high school are so tough.

433
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,660
Once they get to college,

434
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,420
it's like they're free for the first time. You couldn't control them if you wanted to.

435
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,130
What are you talking about? There are still people like me and Li Yubing.

436
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,760
Right? Pure friends no matter what.

437
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,760
Li Yubing, where do you live?

438
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,660
Since you went to First Middle School, do you live in the Annan area?

439
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,090
Right, right. I live right up there, you can just let me off here.

440
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,550
Thank you, Uncle.

441
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,010
Thank you, Uncle. I'm off now. Bye-bye.

442
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,640
- I'll message you on Wechat.
- Okay.

443
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,220
Dad, do you think he has two homes now?

444
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,360
Is that so?

445
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,390
- Maybe.
- That's so sad.

446
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,420
- Mom. Dad. I'm home.
- Our hockey star is home.

447
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,130
Here, I'll take this.

448
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,050
Dad.

449
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,620
Why did you just get back?

450
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,030
Is this the newest Astrophysical Journal? I finished it already.

451
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,150
Perfect, we can have an in-depth discussion about it.

452
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,610
What discussion? Do you guys have to discuss these scientific things as soon as you see each other?

453
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,680
- Mom's angry.
- Let's eat first. We were waiting for you.

454
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,430
- Let's eat first, let's eat first.
- Okay.

455
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,170
Why didn't you let me pick you up? You didn't even tell me when you were coming back.

456
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,580
It's mainly because I got a ride from a classmate.

457
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,750
Don't trouble other people all the time. What did dad always tell you?

458
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,310
It's better to give than receive. Before you receive, you must first learn to give.

459
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,460
- To give and persevere to do so.
- To give and persevere to do so.

460
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,660
Professor Li, this is home, not your classroom.

461
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,600
- Can you put away the teacher act when you're at home?
- Eat, eat.

462
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,280
Which classmate dropped you off?

463
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,790
It's... Tang Xue. She's at LUU, too.

464
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,830
Tang Xue?

465
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,600
Your classmate from elementary school?

466
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,340
You still remember?

467
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,670
Of course, I remember.

468
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,400
When you were little, your face was almost scarred because of her. It gave me such a scare.

469
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,420
At the time, Tang Xue's mom even offered to give me her daughter

470
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,390
as a daughter-in-law to make up for it.

471
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,650
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

472
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:25,070
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

473
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:31,590
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

474
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:37,940
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

475
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:44,040
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

476
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:51,460
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

477
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:58,030
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

478
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,800
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

479
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,740
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

480
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,090
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

481
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,000
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

482
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,010
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

483
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:26,630
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

484
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,840
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

485
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:39,370
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

486
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:45,830
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

487
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:51,870
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

488
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:59,350
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

489
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:05,870
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

490
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:11,900
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

491
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:18,070
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

492
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:25,040
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

493
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,270
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

494
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:38,700
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

495
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,890
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

496
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:52,350
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

497
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,420
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

498
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,600
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

499
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,270
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
