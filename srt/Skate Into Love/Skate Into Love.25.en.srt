[Episode 25]

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,880
Coach Chu, even though I am dating, it will not affect my training.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,270
I am working hard to stay on the team because I truly like speed skating.

20
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,920
So I promise you that I will show you even better results to prove myself to you.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,580
Can I do it?

22
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,990
What?

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,440
Do you really think I can do it?

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,210
Why did you suddenly lose your confidence?

25
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,530
What do I do if I don't place in this competition?

26
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,660
You were speaking so confidently just now.

27
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,890
I was just faking it. How could I admit weakness in front of all those people?

28
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,980
Coach Chu acknowledges you. She said you have the ability.

29
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,360
Even if I do well in training, what does that matter? After all, I haven't won any actual competitions.

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,790
If I can't place in the upcoming competition again,

31
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,680
even Coach Chu will be embarrassed.

32
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,570
What are you doing?

33
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,140
You're so ugly when you're dejected. Look! You're cuter when you make a counterattack.

34
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,890
You need to believe in yourself. You can definitely get through this.

35
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,450
Come over here.

36
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,630
My head does ache a little.

37
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,970
My head aches wondering if your dad knows about our relationship.

38
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,890
Come here.

39
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,160
You already deleted the Weibo post. My parents don't even look at the forums.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,770
Who's going to know?

41
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,880
How is your head this hard?

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,760
That really hurts. Tang Xue!

43
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,870
Fatty, every single day you're making Xiao Yuan watch this.

44
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,360
Their team's going to have a competition soon, do you know?

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,400
You're having fun with her every day.

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,640
Stop dragging her down.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,980
Big Jiang, why are you even bossier than our captain?

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,860
Relax. We already finished today's training.

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,080
That's right.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,260
I'm helping her relax.

51
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,830
I'm telling you. Watching this can start an excitation wave, increase endorphins.

52
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,890
It can only improve training efficiency this way.

53
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,780
See? She's had great improvement recently.

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,010
That's right.

55
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,610
Also, can you persuade Zhang Yuewei

56
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,520
to stop having such a long face about training all the time?

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,390
Am I right? What's the most important thing about living? Being happy, am I right?

58
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,450
Every day you go "blah blah blah.“ You've got too much to say.

59
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,740
Wei-wei isn't upset because of the training.

60
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,610
In any case, watching this will help with training.

61
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,670
Indeed, Wei-wei should be happier.

the club asked to see me.

68
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,950
Did Coach Chu and the club say anything to you?

69
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,750
Even though Coach Chu has never supported dating,

70
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,180
she was actually on my side this time, and she affirmed my ability to Manager Ma.

Who are you calling old?

95
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,420
It's all because of your dad. He's too proud of being old.

96

We're old-fashioned.

97

Look at what he's saying about me. Am I that old? You have such a young mom!

98

No. My mother is the world's youngest, most beautiful, kindest mother.

Under my mother's guidance, my father has also become very young.

I'm already with Li Yubing.

160
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,780
Right. Not just friends. We're also comrades.

161
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,490
We're comrades who fight for on-ice sports together.

162
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,250
Focus on training. Focus on the competition. I'll be waiting for your good news.

163
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,500
Let's talk about the other things when you come back.

164
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,710
Tang Xue, when I get the gold metal and come back,

165
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,230
I have too much to say to you.

166
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,320
Son?

167
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,540
Before you train, eat some fruit.

168
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,760
After you finish training, have some soup.

169
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,010
Mother,

170
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,420
you said that as long as I place first, you won't stop me from dating. Right?

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I did, but we both need to keep our promises.

172
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,480
Then I'm going to go train.

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Good thing we still have elective courses, or else I can't even see Master Tang.

174
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,170
It's not a big deal.

175
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,200
Master Tang, watch yourself in public. You're now Li Yubing's publicized girlfriend.

176
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,850
That's Li Yubing's girlfriend?

177
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,420
She participated in the campus singing competition with Li Yubing and Figure Skating Prodigy Yu Yan.

178
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,480
See?

179
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,610
Isn't that the Tang Xue who just joined the speed skating team? She looks plain and boring.

180
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,140
- Can she even take care of our Ice God?
- I think she's so lucky.

181
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,270
She's really a lucky koi. Let me worship her a bit.

182
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,160
Li Yubing is the campus grass (best looking guy on campus) and is the Ice God. Since you two publicized your relationship,

183
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,500
there's bound to be jealous people who will say whatever. It's very normal. Don't take it to heart.

184
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,400
What does that mean? Is Li Yubing at a loss,

185
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,100
or am I with him thanks to my previous eight generations of luck?

186
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,510
He was the one who pursued me.

187
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,690
- They're just jealous and hateful of you.
- Get lost!

188
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,740
Don't worry about it.

189
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,670
Every relationship must be interfered with by outside forces.

190
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,370
You're Li Yubing's girlfriend, right? I'll give you an extra piece of chicken.

191
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,350
Take good care of our Ice God.

192
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,680
It's not enough that they think Li Yubing is out of my league. Do they want me to become an assistant-style girlfriend?

193
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,560
Thanks, Auntie.

194
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,960
Master Tang, stop being angry.

195
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,440
See? You even got an extra piece of chicken. Isn't that great?

196
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,260
Eat your food.

197
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,420
In the future, things like this will only be more common. Just accept it and move on.

198
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,250
Laozi once said that good fortune comes after a disaster.

199
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,520
Tang Xue, you need to see this with an open mind. Even Laozi has said that

200
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,760
bad things can become good. I'll give you my chicken leg.

201
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,830
Sugar Cube, do you have time tonight after training? I haven't seen you all day.

Old Ye, has your mouth been blessed?

203

If you say good things will happen, they really do.

204

- What?

It's a secret.

Welcome to the opening ceremony of the Olympic City Cup: Beijing World Minor Hockey Invitational Tournament.

208
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,830
Today, we were lucky enough to Lincheng Union University's XDragons Team's main center.

209
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,920
He is also one of the Olympic City Cup's

210
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,840
previous MVP players. Li Yubing will be our guest for this opening ceremony.

211

Let us welcome the Ice God

You're so bedazzling, but what about me?

214
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,910
And now, let's have our Ice God say a couple of words.

215
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,570
Hello, everybody. I am Li Yubing.

216
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,560
I'm happy to be here at the Olympic City Cup's press conference.

217
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,950
As one of the members of China's winter sports, I hope to motivate more people

218
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,330
to join and experience winter sports through our hard work.

219
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,700
We hope to make our own contributions to the country's initiative of "Three Hundred Million People on Snow and Ice."

220
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,150
At the same time, I hope the younger athletes will work harder

221
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,420
because China's hockey future is yours.

222
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,750

Why do I feel like you're not in a good state? Is training too tiring?

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm going to go.

226
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,950
I'm really tired.

Tang Xue, are you too tired? Do you want to soak your feet with us?

We have snacks.

Talk about it. What's wrong?

233
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,760
I've discovered that Li Yubing attracts too much attention and is too excellent.

234
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,920
I look as transparent as glass

235
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,220
standing next to him. I have no sense of existence at all.

236
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,850
I'm not saying I want to be as dazzling as him

237
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,330
or as famous as him, I just wish I was as excellent as he is.

238

That way I won't be seen as his girlfriend when I'm with him.

Aren't you his girlfriend?

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,810
Yes, but I mean that when I'm with him–

241
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,000
You don't want to be inferior to him?

242
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,820
That's right. That's exactly what I mean. If our relationship continues like this,

243
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,590
everyone else aside from people we know will see me as his girlfriend and not Tang Xue.

244
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,890
A bright moon makes stars scarce. Not to mention, he's Li Yubing. He's like a scorching sun.

245
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,430
Must stars be overshadowed by sunshine?

246
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Look. The stars outside the window

247

are tens of thousands, even tens of millions of light years away from us.

But the distance between Li Yubing and you? Compared to the distance to the stars,

it's nothing, Tang Xue.

250

Tang Xue, you just need to work hard and you'll be able to catch up to him.

251

How about this, Master Tang? I'm going to ask you a serious question.

252
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,320
Did you decide to pursue short track speed skating again because of Li Yubing?

253
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,780
Of course not. This is my dream. It has nothing to do with other people.

254
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,190
That's good. Let's not forget why we started, and continue to work hard towards our dreams.

255
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,990
I believe you'll be able to show yourself on the tracks one day.

You'll shine as bright as Li Yubing. No, even brighter.

257
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,460
You're right. I shouldn't be that conscious of Li Yubing's brightness.

258
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,070
I should work hard to be myself to catch up to him

Tang Xue, I will give you an explanation.

468
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,990
That side.

469
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,700
- This side?
- Go in.

470
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,450
- How about you?
- Are you not coming with us?

471
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,210
I have something to do.

472
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,090
Hurry! We'll wait for you.

473
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,490
- Hurry!
- Secrets cannot be revealed.

474
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,260
I've already seen Harbin Bears' Song Anjie beforehand. He is very strong,

475
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,300
but we're stronger.

476
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Tonight, let's turn the skating rink upside down. Is everyone ready?

477
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,220
- Ready!
- Louder!

478
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,310
Sister-in-Law has come for an inspection!

479
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,160
Why did you come?

480
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,340
I'm still paying back your mortgage loans, so I can't buy anything expensive.

481
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,090
Tape?

482
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,090
Hope you succeed and beat everyone.

483
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,090
Do well in your game. If you win, you'll get a reward.

484
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,650
Is my reward the Kiss of Victory?

485
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,510
Win first, then we can talk.

486
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,150
- XDragons!
- Must win!

487
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,140
Audience, the most exciting moment is about to come!

488
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,590
This season's collegiate hockey opening game is about to start.

489
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,300
- Must win!
- XDragons!

490
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,310
- Must win!
- XDragons!

491
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,780
- Must win!
- XDragons!

492
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:21,490
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
