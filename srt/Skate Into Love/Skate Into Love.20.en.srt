When you were little, your face was almost scarred because of her. It gave me such a scare.

19
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,040
Tang Xue's mother even offered to give me her daughter

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,970
as a daughter-in-law to make up for it.

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,620
It's okay. It's not a serious injury. Don't worry.

22

It's nothing to worry about, he just fell into the bushes.

Right. Is Tang Xue dating anyone now?

he can have our Xiao Xue as compensation." It's him, right?

I'm so pretty now, and there are so many people pursuing me.

99

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,540
But nowadays, everyone is mesmerized by celebrity news.

161
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,970
Now, their newspaper has become flower wrapping.

162
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,700
Your dad hasn't considered giving up?

163
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,090
No. He said someone has to carry on. I quite admire him.

164
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,340
You and he are pretty similar.

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,710
You don't want the flowers?

166
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,000
[Mangrove Tree Food Hall]

167
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,970
Li Yubing, why is he here?

168
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,260
Hey, Tang Xue.

169
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,270
Why did you come here?

170
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,950
I just wanted to learn about ice skating and experience

171
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,950
what your favorite sport is like.

172
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,350
There are so many people here! Did you think you were at the training grounds?

173
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,120
I know.

174
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,780
Sorry.

175
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,070
It's okay. Tang Xue, everyone who ice skates is like this, right?

176
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,070
Stop standing around and go skate.

177
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,920
Tang Xue,

178
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,250
how about you give me a couple of tips?

179
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,140
After I got on the ice this time, I felt like a dumb log.

180
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,530
All right, I'll teach you.

181
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,790
Tang Xue, go skate. Don't worry.

182
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,100
You're welcome. I'll teach you.

183
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,120
I'll hold you while you skate. Slowly.

184
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,230
Left, right, left, right.

185
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,030
Left, right.

186
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,530
Left. Off you go!

187
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,080
Li Yubing, you did that on purpose. Right?

188
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,440
Yes! What about it?

189
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,100
I like Tang Xue.

190
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,040
Me too.

191
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,740
But for the past three years, the person Tang Xue liked was me.

192
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,000
It's okay.

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,790
I've forgiven her already.

194
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,270
It looks like you're not her boyfriend yet.

195
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,750
Sooner or later, I will be.

196
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,120
Where does your confidence come from?

197
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,060
Tang Xue gave it and I think she's quite happy right now.

198
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,080
At least, happier than when she liked you.

199
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,420
What are you guys doing? Did you finish practicing?

200
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,720
Tang Xue, how did your skating go?

201
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,020
Pretty good, but I'm getting ready to go back home now.

202
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,250
We skated pretty well, too.

203
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,030
Coach Li tried his hardest to teach me, and we understand each other quite well.

204
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,350
Isn't that right, Coach Li?

205
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,430
Welcome!

206
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,630
Big Jiang?

207
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,870
- Brother Tie.
- Alone?

208
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,950
Right, I came by myself.

209
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,330
What do you want to eat?

210
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm not eating today.

211
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,200
I have a favor to beg of you.

212
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,850
You're not eating and you still have a favor to beg of me? Go ahead.

213
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,200
On Chinese New Year's Eve, make a reservation for me for dinner.

214
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,020
You're staying at Lincheng alone and not going home to celebrate Chinese New Year?

215
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,710
As soon as I go home, my parents will urge me to go on blind dates. I can avoid it this way.

216
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,790
Moreover, when we celebrate Chinese New Year, I think you're probably lonely. I'll keep you company.

217
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,320
Thank you. I'm frantically busy on Chinese New Year's Eve. Don't cause me any trouble.

218
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,110
Brother Tie, just serve me this one time. I beg you.

219
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,300
Fine. How many people? What do you want to eat? I'll prepare it for you.

220
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,990
Not many people. Two people. This time, Wei-wei's not leaving either.

221
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,580
I was wondering if you can make a spicier hot pot. She loves eating spicy food.

222
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,030
It's the New Year celebration. Things should be red and hot.

223
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,130
The key point here is that you can't eat spicy food.

224
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,220
I'll just practice, right?

225
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,630
Big Jiang, if you like a person,

226
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,000
then tell them directly.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,430
What do I say?

228
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,810
Tell Wei-wei that you like her.

229
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,470
It's not shameful when a man's braver and more direct.

230
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,570
But her eyes have never left—

231
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,750
But your eyes have also never left her.

232
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,410
♫ I couldn’t believe in that split second, she who
believed you or I shed tears ♫

233
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,950
Old man, you understand everything.

234
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,740
It's decided then. I'm going to get going.

235
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,800
You're still putting on an act.

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,550
Come over earlier on Chinese New Year's Eve.

237
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,810
♫ I still love you ♫

238
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,680
Boss, are you open on New Year's Eve?

239
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,950
I'm taking a one-day break on New Year's Eve. I'm coming back to work on New Year's Day. Sorry.

240
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,190
Oh, all right then.

241
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,260
Tang Xue, don't you think the ice in this ice rink is really stiff?

242
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,870
It's not as comfortable to skate here compared to our school.

243
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,540
Of course. After all, it's a commercial ice rink. It's understandable.

244
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,020
If you're talking about the best venue, it's, of course, the international competition venue.

245
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,860
I heard that in order to maintain the flexibility of the ice,

246
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,140
they added a certain amount of milk in there.

247
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,390
This way it would be especially soft when you step on it.

248
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,910
For such an ice rink, we have to keep up the good work.

249
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,040
Oh right, I heard that Xijiao opened another ice rink. We should go some time.

250
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,470
All right.

251
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,840
Athletes, like you guys, really can put up with things regular people can't.

252
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,600
Today, I experienced your daily routine. It's pretty difficult.

253
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,850
Us athletes have cheap bones.
(T/N: miserable or worthless creatures)

254
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,570
We are obsessed with the feeling of our muscles tearing, it makes our blood flow.

255
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,740
It's the feeling of adrenaline shooting up. Isn't it, Li Yubing?

256
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,750
Then I'll be heading back first.

257
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,610
Today, thank you, Coach Li, for your advice.

258
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,430
I benefited a lot from this.

259
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,800
No problem. You can come and find me anytime you need.

260
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
- Tang Xue, I'll get going.
- Bye-bye.

261
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,930
I'll take you home.

262
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,070
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

263
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,270
Dad, I'm back.

264
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,570
Hey, you haven't shown up all afternoon. Where did you go?

265
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,480
I skated—

266
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,110
I slid down slides.

267
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,480
Sliding down slides?

268
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,750
Those are for kids. Are you sure you didn't break the slide with your physique?

269
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,740
If I did, how would I be here?

270
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,800
You're still a child at heart.

271
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,770
It's not just a child that is in my heart.

272
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,750
Dad, isn't it weird?

273
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,590
When I went to slide down slides today,

274
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,470
I strangely felt something that I used to experience

275
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,340
back then when I was ice skating.

276
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,670
A feeling where my heart was racing and my blood was pumping.

277
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,910
If you look at me now,

278
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,950
I'm young, strong, and healthy.

279
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,280
If I go back and...

280
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,530
try ice skating again...

281
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,070
is that okay?

282
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,780
You better not be telling me that... you still want to skate?

283
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,930
I'm just saying.

284
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,430
Don't talk about it!

285
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,320
Do you know how distraught we were when you had that accident last time?

286
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,940
In a matter of one night, so many of my hairs turned white.

287
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,020
Your mom has fainted more times than I can count.

288
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,000
Let me tell you, Daughter.

289
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,780
You're our only daughter.

290
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,840
I don't have any extravagant hopes for you.

291
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,230
I just hope that you'll healthily and peacefully grow up.

292
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,730
Really, we have nothing more to ask for. We're satisfied with the way things are right now.

293
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,260
Moreover, skating...

294
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,130
will cause you so much damage. I...

295
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,110
Dad, I was just saying.

296
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,440
Don't get too excited. Don't.

297
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,660
Daughter!

298
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,780
It's good if you become a vet!

299
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,210
Study well and stop thinking about those nonsensical things.

300
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,630
I don't have any extravagant hopes for you.

301
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,880
I just hope that you'll healthily and peacefully grow up.

302
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,090
Really, we have nothing more to ask for. We're satisfied with the way things are right now.

303
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,010
Tang Xue, are you asleep yet?

304
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,410
Not yet. What's up?

305
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,430
Tomorrow, I want to go back and take a look around our elementary school. Let's go together.

306
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,010
Okay.

307
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,960
I tentatively asked my dad

308
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,190
about returning back to learning short track speed skating.

309
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,190
His attitude about this was extremely determined. He rejected me without hesitation.

310
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,040
He's worried that you'll get hurt. Parents, you know,

311
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,590
hope that we live a long life peacefully.

312
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,860
Compared to getting hurt, I'm more scared of living long while being bored.

313
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,930
Then, what do you plan to do?

314
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,860
Anyways, I already transferred majors. I'll keep it a secret from them as long as I can.

315
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,430
I think it's better to tell them earlier than later.

316
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,570
They don't approve now. It'll be even more of a hassle later on.

317
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,840
I just managed to get into the short track speed skating team.

318
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,580
What if I tell them and they don't approve. Do you want me to switch back to veterinary medicine?

319
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,610
All right, all right! Stop stressing out. Take it easy.

320
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,170

Climbing the gate.

Climbing over? No, that's too dangerous. Let's go through the back.

I just want to climb the gate. I haven't climbed in so long.

That's because you always got good grades back then.

400
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,200
My deskmate is called Li Yubing. He's a very annoying guy.

401
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,600
Why am I annoyed by him?

402
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,800
Because Grandpa promised me, if I could get first in the class for the exam,

403
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,900
he'd take me to Disneyland. I really want to go to Disneyland.

404
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,000
But I'm not first in the class. Li Yubing is.

405
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,800
Teacher praised Li Yubing at the parent-teacher conference. Dad said to me,

406
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,600
"Look at Li Yubing, then look at yourself."

407
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I hope Teacher will stop praising Li Yubing,

408
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,000
because he's too annoying.

409

Okay, stop reading.

410

Do you know why teacher asked you to come to the office?

411
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,300
Classmates should be united and friendly,

helping each other and improving together.

413
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,700
Look at Li Yubing's essay.

414
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,800
It's all kind words about you.

415
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,900
He said he likes a deskmate like you.

416
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,300
But then look at your essay. What did you say about him?

417
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,900
Teacher knows you want to get first place. That's a good thing.

418
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,600
But we have to depend on our own hard work and improvement.

419
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,800
We can't hope for other students to deteriorate.

420
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,200
If you have a little improvement, Teacher will also praise you.

421
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,300
See! There weren't any incorrect characters in your essay this time.

422
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,200
This is a type of improvement. It's really worth praising.

423
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
Li Yubing helped to correct this for me.

424
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Then next time, I'll let him correct it again.

425
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,900
Tell your parents to come tomorrow.

426

So, were you able to go to Disneyland?

Thanks to you, I have still never visited there.

428
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
If I knew you had this wish,

429
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,800
I would've pretended to be sick and not taken the test.

430

Hepatitis, gastritis, appendicitis.

431
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,400
I'd say anything for your wish to come true.

I didn't keep our promise.

437

It's been a long time since then. Let's not mention unhappy memories.

476
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,220
See.

477
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,920
He's a champion, he's gentle, and he's handsome, too.

478
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,170
Who wouldn't like this kind of Little Sheep, right?

479
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,800
I doubt it. I don't think Tang Xue is into the underage type.

480
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,330
Besides, Yu Yan left already.

481
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,340
That's true.

482
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,910
Then it must be Bian Cheng.

483
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,280
Top student, mature, like a melancholy prince.

484
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,570
Also, he was the first boy Master Tang ever liked.

485
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,780
Impossible.

486
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,960
She wouldn't go back to the past.
(T/N: idiom: a good horse doesn't go back to the same pasture)

487
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,570
I don't think Tang Xue feels that way.

488
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,130
That's what you think.

489
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,690
Li Yubing, I have a small immature suggestion.

490
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,040
The early bird gets a worm and the late bird suffers.

491
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,030
Such a great girl is

492
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,310
like a Chinese New Year train ticket.

493
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,890
When you check on the computer, there are lots of tickets,

494
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,740
but in reality, each ticket is hard to get.

495
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,730
I'll leave it at that.

496
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,240
Think about it on your own.

497
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,450
Ponder it for a while. I'm hanging up. Bye-bye.

498
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,890
Hey–

499
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,990
Listen, how heavy is this brow?

500
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,650
Listen. How intense is this longing?

501
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,440
[Master Tang]

502
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,770
Master Tang, what is it this time?

503
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,910
Little Yuzi, there's something I need you to think about for me.

504
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,790
Li Yubing told me he has someone he likes today.

505
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,230
You're close with him, tell me who it is.

506
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,860
Master Tang, why are you asking about this?

507
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,630
Could it be... you like Li Yubing?

508
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,790
I—

509
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,710
What? I can't hear you. Speak up!

510
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,250
What'd you say?

511
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,180
I like Li Yubing.

512
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,500
Do you have a death wish? Hurry up. Analyze it for me.

513
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,750
Say, do you think Li Yubing might like Zhang Yuewei?

514
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,640
See. She's a champion, she's cool and mysterious.

515
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,400
This kind of girl can make a lot of guys want to fight for her.

516
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,330
Plus, the two of them hang out a lot.

517
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,190
I don't think so. They're like brothers.

518
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,470
Then it must be Zhou Ran.

519
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,570
Zhou Ran is the prettiest girl in school,

520
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,620
she has good grades, and such long legs, too.

521
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,060
She has everything that guys look for in a girl.

522
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,480
I don't think that's possible either.

523
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,670
If they were going to get together it would have happened already, why would he wait until now?

524
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,620
It's not too late now either, Master Tang.

525
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,180
I have a small immature suggestion.

526
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,920
Men are like the food in our cafeteria.

527
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,700
It doesn't taste good, but if you go late, there won't be any left.

528
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,970
Especially a specialty dish like Li Yubing, a lot of people will definitely fight for him.

529
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,300
I'll leave it at that.

530
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,290
Let's keep it simple. Master Tang, you think about it on your own.

531
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,410
I'm hanging up. Bye-bye.

532
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,050
If longing could be heard,

533
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,480
mine would be deafening.

534
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,980
Little Xia, it's so late, you haven't slept yet?

535
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,440
I miss you. What are you doing?

536
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,600
I miss you, too.

537
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,000
You're lying. Why didn't you call me?

538
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,680
It's not that. I was writing you a—

539
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,440
Write?

540
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,170
Hold on,

541
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,810
someone's calling me. I'll call you back in a bit.

542
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,820
Explain what you were saying first. What were you writing?

543
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,860
Ice God, what's up? Hurry up, I'm busy.

544
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,190
I've thought it through. I need to take action.

545
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,730
I've decided to be proactive.

546
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,240
Do you have any ideas? What do you think I should do?

547
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,200
You're an Ice God, and you still need to ask other people about this kind of thing?

548
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,280
Let me think.

549
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,210
For this kind of thing, there are three steps.

550
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,870
The first step is to carefully pick a location.

551
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,520
Second, create a romantic atmosphere.

552
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,870
Third, hug her. That's it.

553
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,280
Why does it sound so easy when you say it?

554
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,070
Yeah! It is that easy. What's so hard about this?

555
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,190
Bing, I have to go. I'm hanging up.

556
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,140
Wait. What location should I pick?

557
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:45,160
Since you're confessing, choose a place that has a ceremonial feel to it. Okay?

558
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,620
This idea is good.

559
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,360
Brother Bing, I really have to go. If I don't go now, I'll be dead.

560
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,300
Bye-bye, I'm really done. Hanging up now.

561
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,930
[hammer to head emoticons]
[knife emoticons]

562
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,580
I'm dead.

563
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,080
I was too focused on them.

564
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,780
Huan-huan, I was writing you a test message.

565
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,120
I don't think I can send this message tonight.

566
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,560
Let's do this. I'll just read it out to you. Okay?

567
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,250
Listen. This city is so empty.

568
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,850
Listen. This longing is so intense.

569
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,820
This road has all this heavy traffic.
(T/N: idiom: road with an endless stream of horses and carriages)

570
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,710
Who can I share it with?

571
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,040
Alone. Alone.

572
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,030
- Hello?
- Hello? It's so late, why aren't you here yet?

573
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,800
Traffic. Relax, I've already arranged everything for you.

574
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
I promise it's going to be a great surprise.

575
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,310
Hurry up, I'm panicking. This is such an important matter.

576
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,420
Plus, this moment is going to determine my life. Nothing can go wrong.

577
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,010
I'm reliable, don't worry.

578
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,970
I promise you'll have everything you need, and everything you don't need, too.

579
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,310
Just stop worrying, okay?

580
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,150
Everything I don't need? What does that mean?

581
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,400
Stop asking, stop asking. You'll find out soon.

582
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,220
I'm hanging up.

583
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,710
Hello? Hello?

584
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,640
What are you looking at?

585
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,500
You're here?

586
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,820
Look at this cathedral. It's so pretty. So pretty.

587
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,110
It's been here for so long, you just found out it was pretty?

588
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,970
That's true. I didn't really notice it before.

589
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,100
How can Liao Zhenyu be late at the most important time?

590
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,090
- Bro, what are you doing?
- For the last six years, all I thought about was you.

591
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,760
Nothing else, only you!

592
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,890
Everything I need, and everything I don't need, too.

593
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,680
Why would you be with this kind of lousy scum?

594
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,280
Come here, bro, come here. Listen to me.

595
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,190
Let's just do a classic "Hero rescues damsel in distress."

596
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,630
Don't worry, I'll be gentle.

597
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,020
Are you drunk?

598
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,570
- Didn't Liao Zhenyu send you?
- Are you crazy?

599
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,560
He's drunk. Li Yubing, let's go.

600
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,190
- Tang Xue.
- You can't leave.

601
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,270
When she was little, she said she liked romantic cathedrals.

602
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,030
I thought our reunion was fate.

603
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,420
But when I confessed to her here, why did she reject me?

604
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,840
Are all girls this ruthless?

605
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,870
You guys were apart for so long.

606
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:20,180
Right? You both changed over the years. Maybe she's not ruthless, she's just grown up.

607
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,440
Some emotions that you hold in your heart are precious memories.

608
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,150
If you say them out loud, it just ruins that feeling.

609
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,450
Loving someone shouldn't be like this.

610
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:34,780
If you keep treating her like this, she will definitely think she was right to reject you. Right?

611
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,400
I shouldn't have confessed today.

612
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:09,700
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

613
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:17,110
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

614
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:23,730
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

615
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:30,030
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

616
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:36,210
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

617
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:43,580
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

618
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:50,120
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

619
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,860
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

620
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,940
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

621
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,160
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

622
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,160
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

623
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,160
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

624
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,670
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

625
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:24,940
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

626
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:31,360
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

627
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:37,910
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

628
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:43,960
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

629
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,410
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

630
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:57,960
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

631
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,940
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

632
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:10,230
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

633
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:17,140
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

634
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,420
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

635
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:30,830
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

636
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:37,090
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

637
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:44,360
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

638
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,720
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

639
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,710
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

640
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,370
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
