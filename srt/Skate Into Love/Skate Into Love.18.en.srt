Can I write a letter to the principal asking to get rid of the Glorious Youth Festival?

19
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,840
Why would we get rid of it? It's a great festival. Old Ye, what do you think?

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,660
Battle of the mountain cave.

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,550
A person's ability to accept other people's ideas determines their accomplishments.

22
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,370
Old Ye, you're so accomplished.

23
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,520
Did you spend the whole day studying in the dorm again?

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,560
What else? I'm not like you guys. One has a boyfriend who supports her dreams,

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,630
the other has a high school classmate who came to surprise her.

26
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,510
I have books. Books are my teachers and friends.

27
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,270
Books are the stairs humans climb to greatness, they are the fruit of human intelligence.

What did Liao Zhenyu do today?

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,670
Today, since there were so many people out celebrating the Glorious Youth Festival, he raised over ¥10,000 for our Home for Homeless Babies.

31
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,310
How nice.

32
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,770
Why is that for me, the Glorious Youth Festival is just a day of hardship?

33
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,570
When I think about the final exam, my days seem hopeless. I almost want to die.

34
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,040
There's no point in complaining. Shortcuts...

35
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,530
What?

36
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,190
Do not exist.

37

Francis Bacon said, "Life is like a road,

38
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,430
the closest shortcut is usually the worst."

39
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,600
Old Ye, can you give some constructive suggestions?

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,440
I already set the alarm. Tomorrow morning, we'll get up early

41
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,500
and study together.

42

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,060
- I still have to shower.
- I still have to wash my face.

47
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,700
Good luck.

48
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,020
Here, I've outlined it for you. Just review these topics.

49
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,010
I can't do it anymore.

50
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,990
I can't study anymore.

51

If I spend every day like this, I won't last until the exam.

52

Master Tang, do you want to try my psychological suggestions?

You give yourself a small psychological suggestion and it can give you awesome energy!

This is what Xiao Liao taught me.

56
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,330
You're already so good with your field of study, yet you still need to blindly guess. Should I even take the test anymore?

57
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm not that good at it.

58
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,610
You can try, too. What is your name's homophone?

I suggest that you go with another approach.

61
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,140
Stop worrying so much. I already outlined all the topics for you.

62

64
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
I didn't know studying with a top student would make me feel so secure.

65
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,380
I'm pretty useful, right?

66
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,160
But what about my competition?

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,450
Are you okay?

68
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,750
When doing anything, if you want to improve in a short time, the best method is to

69
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,460
have an expert lead you.

Do you think it was because I wanted to? I called you but you didn't pick up.

I wanted to sleep in so I turned my phone off. What's going on?

By the way, why'd you run off during the Glorious Youth Festival?

It was... an impulse.

I heard your high school classmate gave you a grand confession.

82

If the rumors continue like this, are they going to start saying I'm marrying him soon?

Enough of that, I have something serious to discuss.

In a few days, Coach Chu wants me to compete in the Tengxiang Cup.

My performance just won't improve.

So?

I want an expert in the field to lead me.

Okay, I'll guide your training.

Wasn't that the last set?

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,150
After you workout, you have to stretch. Get up.

108
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,660
I can't live like this. I have to train so much every day,

109
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,200
and I have to pass the final exam, too. And our professor

110
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,260
really doesn't like me. Should I just transfer to the sports college?

111
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,590
Seems like that would solve everything.

112
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,020
You're not studying to be a vet anymore?

113
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,100
I have to admit it.

114
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,340
I just don't have the talent for it.

115
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,360
I could spend 10 years studying and learn less than Huan-huan does in a month.

116
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,450
The professor was right.

117
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,400
People should do what they are good at and are passionate about.

118
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,690
If it's not something you're passionate about, there's no point.

119
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,930
It's like...

120
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,930
It's like if someone forced you to date a girl you don't like.

121
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,990
Are you being serious?

122
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,050
I'll think about it after I get through the final exam.

123
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,290
Huan-huan can take care of my major classes, but what about advanced math?

124
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,410
For advanced math, you can find someone to tutor you.

125
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,640
Old Ye and Huan-huan are busy with their own studies, how can I ask them to help even more?

126
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,800
What if... I'm be kind enough and tutor you?

127
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,930
You?

128
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,880
What? You don't think I'm qualified?

129
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,210
That's right. You've always been a high-level top student!

Mom can't be by your side forever.

156
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,500
You can decide who you like and who to be with

157
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,800
when you grow up, isn't that right?

158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,800
But before you become a world champion,

159
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,600
Mom is afraid you'll make a mistake every step you take.

160
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,030
Yan-yan,

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,200
all the efforts I put on you doesn't matter to me.

162
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,400
But you can't, you're my son.

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,200
I can't let my son's effort go down the drain.

164
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,800
I won't be able to endure that.

165
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
Mom,

166
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,350
I'll go.

167
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,700
Here.

168
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,600
You're so early.

169
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
My thirst for knowledge is bursting.

170
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Here, here, here.

171
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Can you help with this problem? I already tried to do it many times.

172
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,900
Let me see.

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let me look at this problem's reasoning.

174
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,800
Which formula?

175
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,000
No, no. This formula.

176
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,400
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing became erratic ♫

177
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,200
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

178
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,500
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

179
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,500
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

180
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,800
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

181
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,600
Why are you staring at me?

182
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,400
Did someone take your rank?

183
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,900
Are you even a top student? You can't even do the first question.

184
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Let me think about it. Sit properly.

185
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
Sit properly.

186
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,900
♫ This moment when your smile is the same ♫

187
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:24,200
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

188
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,000
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto the secrets
you are protecting ♫

189
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,200
My god! How did I fall for you?

190
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,000
I must have an issue.

191
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,300
♫ Loving with no reason until I met you ♫

192
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,800
You got me. You asked me to come help tutor you, but

193
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
you slept for forty minutes.

194
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Are you blaming me?

195
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Who was explaining the problems

196
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,800
so in-depth and hard to understand? We only got through three problems this whole morning.

197
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,500
How could I stay awake?

198
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,200
Fine! It's my fault. I'll repay you next time.

199
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
Okay.

200
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
It hurts.

201
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
What happened?

202
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,200
I accidentally twisted my ankle.

203
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
I'll send you back.

204
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Then, we'll send you back?

205
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,400
No need. Your bike can only fit one person in the back.

206
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
I'm in a rush to get back. They're calling me. I'll leave first.

207
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Tang Xue!

208
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,300
Senior Yubing, sorry to bother you.

209
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Old Deng!

210
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
Do you know where the girl's dormitory for the broadcasting department is?

211
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I know.

212
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
She twisted her ankle, send her back.

213
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,800
No need! I can go back on my own.

214
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Don't. Didn't you twist your ankle?

215
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
- Fatty, she's all yours.
- Sure.

216
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Bye-bye.

217
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,200
Li Yubing, even if you don't like me,

218
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
you can't like Tang Xue.

219
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,700
Let's go, Junior.

220
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,800
Senior, there's no need. I can go back slowly on my own.

221
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,100
- Let's go.
- I can walk slowly.

222
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,300
My ankle... My ankle is actually twisted this time.

223
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,100
Don't worry. I will complete the task my brother assigned me no matter what.

224
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,700
Let's go!

225
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
How is it?

226
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,100
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

227
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,500
- Let me know if you're injured.
- I'm fine.

228
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
What's wrong with you? Do you not look where you're going?

229
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,500
- Are the eyes below your eyebrows not working?
- You again.

230
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Are you kidding me?

231
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,400
It was you who was only looking at the pretty girl and didn't see me and hit me.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm the victim.

233
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,600
Are your words the truth? Do you have evidence?

234
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,000
What a coincidence! Our school has security cameras everywhere.

235
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
Let's go to the control room right now.

236
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,700
We're all fellow students. Don't make this a bigger problem.

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,100
My Goddess has spoken.

238
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,900
Tell me! What should we do?

239
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm afraid I might have internal injuries, send me to the clinic.

240
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,300
You–

241
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,200
You should help send this student, I'm fine. I can walk myself.

242
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Let me send you.

243
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
No problem. I can walk myself.

244
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,100
- Goddess, walk slowly.
- Okay.

245
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,800
- Be careful on the road.
- Okay.

246
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,000
My heart is with you.

247
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,900
Let me tell you, I ride my bike fast. Hold on tight.

248
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,400
Men and women should not touch. Please don't touch my skin.

249
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,900
Why are you grabbing my collar? How can I watch the road?

250
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,400
Don't you like seeing with your belly button? Just use your belly button to watch the road.

251
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,300
Let go. Let go!

252
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,300
Next week is Tengxiang Cup. This is your number.

253
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Stay in good condition these days and don't over practice.

254
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,000
Thanks, Coach.

255
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,400
They all call me the Iron Hammer behind my back.

256
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,400
But I don't need to push you because you're tough enough on yourself.

257
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,400
If all the team members were like you and Zhang Yuewei, then I wouldn't worry so much.

258
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,500
It was you who gave me an opportunity to join the short track speed skating team.

259
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,100
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even have an opportunity to work hard.

260
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,660
I'll let Li Yubing tell her himself.

261
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Do well in your competition.

262
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Is balancing school work and training at the same time tough?

263
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,470
I want to switch my major.

264
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,600
You thought it through? Did you discuss it with your parents?

265
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
About how I got injured in the past...

266
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I don't even need to think and I know their response.

267
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,300
So I want to transfer first and then see what happens.

268
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,200
You need to think it through clearly.

269
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
If you transfer, there's no way out.

270
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,400
I don't want to give myself a way out. This way I can fight to win or die.

271
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Good.

272
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Whatever it is, I'll always support you.

273
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,050
Comeback Battle. Come watch if you have time.

274
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,730
Wow!

275
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,800
Master Tang, what are you saying?

276
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,380
Huan-huan and I will definitely be at your comeback battle to give you morale!

277
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,290
It happens that I'm free that day, so I'll grudgingly come and watch.

278
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,880
Tang Xue, I can't come to your competition.

279
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,690
The day before the competition is the day I leave for Canada.

280
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,790
You're leaving so soon?

281
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,670
You're going to Canada?

282
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,760
That means we have two happy events.

283
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,670
Yu Yan is going abroad for training, and I'm returning to the ice track.

284
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,930
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

285
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,860
Tang Xue, do you really think I should go?

286
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,940
Why wouldn't you go?

287
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,240
You're not disappointed from the Glorious Youth Festival incident, are you?

288
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,460
You'll only be disappointed if you don't expect it.

289
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,750
Since I'd already expected it, how would I be disappointed?

290
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,740
Sometimes I feel like you're a bit scary.

291
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,020
How am I scary?

292
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,050
Scary that you're so mature. We're all just college students,

293
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,710
but you're trying to be even deeper than my grandpa is.

294
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,220
You live with such clear distinctions. Does your life even have any fun in it?

295
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,540
Are you saying that a chaotic life would have fun in it?

296
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,350
If a person lived without a goal,

297
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,210
things would be unclear and they wouldn't know how to achieve their goal.

298
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,510
They'd be living their entire life accomplishing nothing.

299
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,760
You're also someone with clear goals, right?

300
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,300
That's why we work together well.

301
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,230
Oh right!

302
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,650
This is a ticket to Tang Xue's Tengxiang Cup competition.

303
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,990
The competition is right at LUU. Are you coming?

304
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,340
I'll come. I'll also write a news report

305
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,830
that allows Tang Xue to re-emerge in the world of short track speed skating.

306
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,930
How do you know she'll definitely win?

307
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,150
Even if she loses, it can work. News reports have a lot of different aspects.

308
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,760
Whoever is your enemy will definitely die very tragically.

309
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,400
You should say, whoever is my friend

310
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,210
will definitely be very fortunate.

311
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,270
I hope so.

312
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,770
Come in.

313
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,100
Professor Zhou, are you free?

314
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,660
[Office]

315
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,300
You don't need to beg. You have to score 80 points to pass.

316
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,690
I'm not going to lower it for you.

317
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,040
I didn't come to ask you to lower the requirement.

318
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,570
I...

319
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,970
would like to...transfer majors next semester.

320
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,410
Transfer?

321
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,560
I want to transfer to the sports college and focus on training short track speed skating.

322
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,190
Then, why didn't you go to the Sports College from the start?

323
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,360
I was injured at the time and was forced to give up.

324
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,630
I thought I'd never be able to be an athlete again in my lifetime.

325
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,350
The first day of your class, you mentioned passion.

326
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,190
At that time, my head was full of speed skating.

327
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,760
I think that maybe the idea of speed skating was just in hibernation for a long time.

328
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,840
Now that the weather has warmed up, it's time for it to wake up.

329
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,570
It was difficult to get an opportunity for me to start again.

330
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,550
I'd like to try it.

331
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,290
You young people...

332
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,100
If you want to transfer today, would you transfer back tomorrow?

333
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,370
But it's great to be young.

334
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,190
When I was young, our teacher

335
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,470
made us write an essay called "my ideal dream."

336
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,060
Truthfully, what kind of dream did I even have at that time?

337
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,150
In the blink of an eye, I'd entered the middle-aged stage of life.

338
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,110
In this stage of life, if you tell people you've got a dream,

339
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,790
people would definitely laugh and say you're just dreaming.

340
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,410
So, regarding dreams,

341
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,750
it seems it's only suitable for those few years of your youth.

342
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:38,480
Tang Xue, I think that in this time of your life

343
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,040
you should do what you're passionate about.

344
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,440
You're approving it?

345
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,420
Approving is one thing,

346
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,950
but you must serve well on your last duty.

347
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,020
I'm telling you! If you don't pass the final exam,

348
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,070
I definitely won't sign your transfer application.

349
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,250
I promise! I'll definitely pass!

350
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,920
Professor, what's your dream?

351
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,640

361
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,980
But... I don't have many friends.

Now you do.

363
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:46,240
Everybody calls me Master Tang. From now on, if you have any troubles then look for me.

364
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,070
Say, a person like you, with good looks, a good name,

365
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,300
and good skills,

366
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,500
should only exist in comics books.

367
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,000
Which ones of these do you want?

368
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,480
I just want this one.

369

I just feel like... it's a little bit like you.

Tang Xue, I'm leaving.

372

Don't send me off. I'm afraid I will be too sad.

373
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,280
I'm even more afraid that if I see you, I won't be able to stop myself from staying.

374
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,400
I want to tell you, I like you.

375
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,050
I want to see you every single day.

376
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,120
I want to tell you, each time you appear in my mind,

377
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,770
I realize I'm always smiling.

378
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,060
I'm just like a sunflower. Wherever you are,

379
