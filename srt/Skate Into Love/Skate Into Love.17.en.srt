[Episode 17]

18
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,500
Tomorrow is the Glorious Youth Festival. Do you think Coach will give us the day off?

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,080
You wish. There's no way we're getting the day off.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,430
At most, she might go easy on us, and maybe let us skip two laps.

21
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,160
What's more,

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,360
Glorious Youth Festival is also called Confession Festival. No one's confessing to you.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,530
Why do you need to celebrate it?

24
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,680
- What do you mean? How do you know no one's confessing to me?
- Captain! Captain!

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,490
- What are you doing for the Glorious Youth Festival tomorrow?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you waiting for a dream guy to confess to you?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
What festival? Let's just focus on training.

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,900
Captain, you should be gentler.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,700
- I think there are a lot of guys that want to confess to you.
- Yes.

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,180
- But...
- But what?

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,470
They're scared of you.

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,720
Scared of me? Am I that scary?

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,040
You're not scary, you're intimidating.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,100
They want to confess, but they're scared to even talk to you.

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,270
You can try being a little more feminine.

36
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,930
- For example, wearing something cute.
- Yes.

37
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm not feminine?

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,440
"I'm not feminine?" You're not feminine at all.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,860
Let's do this. I'll teach what to say so you'll instantly sound very feminine.

40
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,780
Really~? It's fine~.

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,650
Stop it~. Okay, you try now.

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,360
Really?

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,850
It's fine~.

44
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,150
It's fine.

45
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,240
Oh my god.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,670
- Stop it~.
- Stop it.

47
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,130
It's not "stop it," it's "stop it~."

48
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,960
Where's the "~"?

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,620
Oh my god. You have to drag it out at the end.

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,130
Dragging the ending out makes it sound cute.

51
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,960
Really~? It's fine~. Stop it~.

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,730
You're way too girly. I can't stand you guys,

53
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,230
acting like experts every day when no one's confessing to you either?

54
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,370
What do you mean?

55
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,670
Captain, I'll teach you some more.

56
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,640
- Really~?
- In a girly way.

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,360
It's fine~. Stop it~.

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,460
Captain, don't leave. I'll teach you.

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,560
What's on your mind?

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,970
- Old Xu.
- What's up?

61
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,080
How did you pursue Coach Chu back then?

62
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,160
Why? Is something going on?

63
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,190
Nothing's going on.

64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm just curious.

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Is it because tomorrow's the Glorious Youth Festival?

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,210
No, it's not that. I'm not interested in that kind of thing.

67
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,130
What? Want me to show you a thing or two?

68
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,750
It's okay, no need.

69
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,560
But if you want to say it, that's fine, too. It doesn't hurt to be prepared.

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,940
Ten years ago, we didn't have this sports center.

71
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,210
In the southeast corner of LUU, there was an outdoor ice rink. Chu Xia and I always practiced there.

72
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,630
One night, I strung up a bunch of colored lights and confessed to her there.

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,460
She agreed just like that?

74
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,960
Back then, I was really attractive.

75
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,270
And I was so good at ice hockey. She had already liked me for a while.

76
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,420
Also, once the colored lights came on, what do you think happened?

77
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,950
Li Yubing? I'm not done talking yet.

78
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,050
Don't be scared. We'll change your dressing, okay?

79
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,070
Don't be scared. It doesn't hurt, does it?

80
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,820
Little kitty, I have a girlfriend. Do you?

81
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,060
Oh, that's right. You just got neutered.

82
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,660
Then you can only envy me, isn't that right?

83
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,990
We're almost losing this place, and you're not worried at all.

84
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,460
Isn't it just a question of money? Don't worry, I'll think of something.

85
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,640
Look! There's another single cat here.

86
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,010
Come on, go inside.

87
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,630
Single cat, are you jealous that your Sister Huan-huan has such a responsible boyfriend?

88
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,430
You're just an intern. If someone tall and strong comes along,

89
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,600
you could get replaced anytime.

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,190
Classmate. Classmate!

91
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,810
Hello.

92
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,470
This little guy is injured. Can you take a look at him?

93
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,080
Hello, I'm a doctor. If you need anything, you can tell me.

94
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,190
- What's wrong?
- You're not a vet.

95
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,580
- What's wrong with him?
- It's fine.

96
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,700
It's like this. I'll introduce you, this is my girlfriend.

97
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,700
And you can tell me anything, really, I'm a doctor.

98
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,660
What happened?

99
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,400
He was fighting with a big dog over there. I shooed the big dog away.

100
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,900
Look! He got bit here. Can you clean it for him?

101
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,620
- Of course, no problem.
- It's fine, right?

102
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,520
- Bro, please hold on for a moment.
- Come here, come here.

103
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,590
What are you doing, bro?

104
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,020
It's like this. You're Li Yubing's friend, right?

105
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,620
Something Xue... You're Tang Xue's friend, right?

106
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,420
- Exactly.
- Good to see you, good to see you.

107
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,670
No, no, no. Bro, come here.

108
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,760
Look. You're Li Yubing's teammate. I'm Tang Xue's friend. We're friends of friends,

109
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,980
so we're friends. You can't go after your friend's girlfriend—

110
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,440
Hey.

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,230
- Sorry about that. How embarrassing.
- It's fine, it's fine.

112
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,920
- All done.
- All done?

113
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,590
- We're all done here.
- He's okay, right?

114
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,400
- He's fine. It's not serious.
- You need to be more careful, little guy.

115
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,470
Hey, classmate,

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm not always around here. My WeChat is over there, you can scan it.

117
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,400
If you ever have injured animals, you can contact me anytime.

118
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,250
That's great. Thank you.

119
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,270
- I'll scan it.
- Wait a second! Wait, wait...

120
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,890
Here, you can add my WeChat. If you need anything, I'll contact her. How's that?

121
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,620
Bro,

122
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,540
are you very insecure?

123
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,840
It's not that. It's almost the Glorious Youth Festival. It's best to be careful. I won't see you out.

124
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,700
Huan-huan!

125
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,900
Glorious Youth Festival?

126
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,950
Tomorrow is our school's Glorious Youth Festival.

127
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,610
All girls are looking forward to confessions from guys.

128
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,940
And the more shocking, the better.

129
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,070
This is an excellent opportunity for you.

130
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,710
You know it's not the right time yet.

131
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,740
I would just be embarrassing myself.

132
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,620
You're majoring in news and journalism.

133
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,510
You should know about the power of public opinion.

134
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,780
How much?

135
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,540
That person has paid for you already.

136
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,060
No need to thank me.

137
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,550
I did it because I wanted to.

138
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,190
Long time no see, Junior.

139
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,040
It's you, Senior Deng.

140
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,580
Junior, tomorrow's the Glorious Youth Festival. Do you have—

141
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,010
Ah, right. Do you know if tomorrow

142
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,450
Senior Yubing is free?

143
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,340
Yubing told me he's training, so he'll be busy.

144
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,690
He's so hardworking. I need to learn from him.

145
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,330
Tomorrow, I'll focus on writing articles.

146
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,020
Thank you, Senior.

147
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,720
Buy yourself some corn with the change. Bye-bye.

148
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,650
She has character, I like it. I definitely won't give up.

149
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,360
Surprise.

150
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,890
Let's go. Get changed.

151
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,550
What's wrong? Are you coming or not?

152
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,940
Let's go.

Next time put mine up.

155
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,170
Why are you acting so crazy? That was our senior, and he was helping us.

156

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,760
some were abused.

315
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,180
Some have been homeless since they were born.

316
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,580
We founded the Home for Homeless Babies

317
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,290
to give these animals

318
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,350
another chance to trust humans and feel the warmth of humans,

319
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,620
the compassion of this world.

320
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,680
So here,

321
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,030
I'm asking everyone to show a little bit of compassion.

322
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,170
To them, that little bit means the world.

323
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,400
Thank you, everyone.

324
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,700
Huan-huan, why are you here?

325
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,370
Are you dumb? Why didn't you tell me to come?

326
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,380
I wanted it to be a surprise since it's the Glorious Youth Festival.

327
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,630
This is my present to you.

328
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,060
What present? You are the best present.

329
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,850
It's so cold out, you should go home. You go home first.

330
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,420
As the head of our household, it's my duty and responsibility to do this kind of thing.

331
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,320
I'll do it with you.

332
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,400
Everyone, come look. Friends, hello!

333
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,000
- Come learn about our Home for Homeless Babies.
- Thank you.

334
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,060
Everyone, come and help our

335
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,930
dogs and cats. They could really use your help.

336
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,770
Isn't today the Glorious Youth Festival? Everyone's celebrating.

337
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,400
How come you're here training by yourself?

338
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,150
I'm slower than the others, so I need to work harder.
(T/N: Idiom - clumsy bird flies early)

339
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,680
Even the tortoise can beat the hare if it works hard.

340
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,920
You want to beat Zhang Yuewei?

341
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,470
Not bad. All good athletes want to win.

342
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,260
Good luck. Hang in there.

343
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,190
After seeing your recent efforts, I want to sign you up for the Tengxiang Cup.

344
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,570
Can I enter a competition?

345
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,790
This is a new brand-sponsored competition. It doesn't have much recognition, but it's well-funded.

346
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,900
Last year, there were a few newbies who became well-known through this competition.

347
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,090
What do you think? Do you want to try it out?

348
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,420
Yes. I won't let you down.

349
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,650
Good. Then you need to prepare yourself to work even harder.

350
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,660
Understood.

351
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,160
By the way, higher-ups will be coming to evaluate tomorrow.

352
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,640
The ice rink, changing room, and rest area,

353
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,130
when you leave later, make sure you check these areas and make sure they're clean.

354
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,800
No problem.

355
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,040
[Home for Homeless Babies]
Heavens increase years for cat's lives.

356
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,060
A Universe Full of Food.

357
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,570
Humans and Cats Prosper Together.

358
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,800
Humans and cats prosper together.

359
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,190
Great.

360
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,100
What's wrong, Huan-huan?

361
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,250
What's wrong?

362
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,210
- Don't cry, don't cry.
- I just think your writing looks really nice.

363
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,400
There, there! It's okay.

364
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,370
Why are you crying? We're past the hard part, everything's going well now.

365
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,780
I think you've done too much for me.

366
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,940
It's okay. I'm happy to do it.

367
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,430
I finally get to rest for a bit.

368
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,570
Who is it?

369
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,360
It's me. I'm surprising you for the Glorious Youth Festival.

370
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,060
Do you like it?

371
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,340
Little Sheep, say, why are you also joining in the mess?

372
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,900
Tomorrow, the higher-ups are coming to evaluate. The coach specifically asked me

373
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,000
to make sure everything was clean.

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,400
I... just finished.

375
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,560
- I'll help you clean up.
- Forget it. Forget it.

376
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,920
I'll just think of it as physical conditioning.

377
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,630
Oh, here. This is my festival present to you.

378
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,110
For me?

379
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,480
Is this an antique?

380
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,750
My grandpa gave this to me.

381
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,930
At the time, I was only 4 years old.

382
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,290
Then, how come you're giving it to me?

383
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,860
When I was little, I wanted to travel the world.

384
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,790
But ever since I was 4, I started figure skating.

385
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,440
I put all of my time into skating.

386
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,250
I didn't have any time to stop and enjoy the world.

387
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,810
But after meeting you, I had friends for the first time.

388
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,640
I realized that other than figure skating,

389
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,200
there's a lot of other fun things and people in life.

390
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,900
So I'm giving this to you.

391
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,510
Thank you for opening new doors for me.

392
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,250
You, me, Little Yuzi,

393
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,950
Huan-huan. We're a crew.

394
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,050
I just did what I should.

395
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,010
Tang Xue...

396
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,430
I know...

397
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,300
you think of me as your little brother.

398
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,060
But I want to tell you, I—

399
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,810
Hello?

400
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,480
Mom, I–

401
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,610
I'm at the sports center.

402
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,690
I'm not practicing.

403
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,480
Right now?

404
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,250
But...

405
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,990
Okay, got it.

406
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,850
If your mom's looking for you, you should hurry back.

407
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,280
But I...

408
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,940
I haven't cleaned up yet.

409
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,980
It'll only take a minute.

410
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,970
Go, go. Hurry up.

411
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,190
Thank you for the present! Bye-bye.

412
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,190
How is this Glorious Youth Festival?

413
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,000
More like Labor Day (Festival).

414
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,070
Yan-yan, you're back? Hurry, come here.

415
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,460
Look! I ordered a new skating costume for you.

416
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,590
Try it on.

417
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,620
The thing you said was urgent was this?

418
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,890
Of course. You're going to Canada soon.

419
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,690
I specifically designed some new skating costumes for you.

420
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,510
Let me remind you. A competition is like a battle.

421
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,650
You need to arm yourself before you go, right?

422
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,210
Your costume has to be attention-catching and well-designed.

423
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,620
So that your performance can be more dazzling.

424
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,770
Go try it on.

425
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,400
What's wrong? You don't like it?

426
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,110
It's not that.

427
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,960
Go try it on.

428
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,750
Glorious Youth Festival, please end soon.

429
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,360
Tang Xue.

430
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,320
Come with me. I have a surprise for you.

431
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,870
Don't.

432
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,800
If anyone gives me another surprise today, I'll end both of us.

433
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,500
Wait, don't go.

434
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,190
Why are you running?

435
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,090
If you don't let go, I'll yell sexual harassment!

436
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,020
Sexual harassment!

437
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,970
Is she crazy?

438
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,780
Today's the Glorious Youth Festival.

439
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,080
Have your Wechat Moments started to fill with posts?

440
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,890
They started a while ago.

441
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,490
Some people are happy, some are sad.

442
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,160
Some people are still trying to sell things.

443
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,000
Then, has anyone confessed to you today?

444
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,560
No.

445
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,580
You're not sad about it?

446
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,750
What's there to be sad about?

447
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,350
I read in a book,

448
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,240
trace back to the origin.

449
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,700
We will know that all the sadness in our heart

450
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,920
comes from comparing ourselves

451
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,400
to those around us.

452
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,970
That's why I already shielded myself from my Wechat Moments.

453
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:35,490
To me, today is just another ordinary day.

454
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,030
I should be more like you.

455
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,030
Read more books and be less distracted by random thoughts.

456
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,130
Francis Bacon once said,

457
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,490
"Histories make men wise;

458
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,560
poets witty;

459
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,770
the mathematics, subtle;

460
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,750
natural philosophy, deep;

461
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,620
moral, grave;

462
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,420
logic and rhetoric, able to contend."

463
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,350
Studies pass into and influence manners.

464
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,370
You're right. We need to be

465
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,740
neither pleased by external gains, nor saddened by personal losses.

466
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,050
Let those who are a disturbance and those who are demoralizing

467
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,910
fade away from our world.

468
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,350
- Hug!
- Date! Date!

469
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,190
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

470
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,050
Young lady!

471
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,620
Happy Glorious Youth Festival!

472
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,780
Thank you.

473
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,370
Wait, wait!

474
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,770
You are my last flower recipient today.

475
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,810
So, please allow me to

476
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,490
confess to you.

477
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,780
Sure, go ahead.

478
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,270
You are the prettiest

479
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,590
and most special girl I've ever met.

480
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,570
Your every movement and every smile

481
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,860
influences my heart.

482
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,080
So I will save the most important place in my heart for you.

483
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,580
As soon as you knock,

484
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,550
I will fling open the doors and hug you tight.

485
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,240
I want to tell you, I like you!

486
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:49,720
♫ How can you be optimistic and unconstrained
if you’re unable to let go? ♫

487
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,830
♫ Regardless of who loves who more,
there are too many regrets ♫

488
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:03,130
♫ There’s no outcome because love was given too undisguised ♫

489
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:10,240
♫ Could it be that if we continue, it’s destined to be a game? ♫

490
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,790
♫ Insisting on distinguishing the ups and downs
to make me lose so thoroughly ♫

491
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,300
I mean every word I said.

492
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,980
♫ Those who are not resigned to defeat will occasionally feel exhausted and weak ♫

493
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,650
Thank you.

494
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,020
Truly, I think...

495
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,400
I think this activity you guys came up with...

496
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,900
is really creative.

497
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,310
I'm sorry, I hugged your stomach flat. Go home and eat dinner.

498
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,840
Fill your stomach.

499
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,870
- Okay.
- Bye-bye, have a good festival.

500
00:39:53,870 --> 00:40:00,430
♫ Those who are not resigned to defeat will occasionally feel exhausted and weak ♫

501
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:07,600
♫ Could it be that if we continue, it’s destined to be a game? ♫

502
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,700
♫ Why make a fool of myself when I don’t have
the courage to say goodbye first?  ♫

503
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,190
♫ Looking at the photos to reminisce the past,
the wound is still not healed yet ♫

504
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,120
I know what I'm doing is pointless.

505
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,660
But I'm really glad I was able to tell you how I feel.

506
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,530
Wei-wei, one day,

507
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,030
I will tell you again, face-to-face.

508
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,060
As Jiang Shijia,

509
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,040
I'll hug you tight.

510
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:09,420
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

511
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:16,830
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

512
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:23,370
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

513
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:29,730
♫ I had the kind of luck as if I plucked a star ♫

514
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:35,870
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

515
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:43,270
♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

516
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:49,850
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

517
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:54,690
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

518
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,630
♫ In this big world, I’ll hold gently onto
the secrets you are protecting ♫

519
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,880
♫ I’m lucky to receive the surprise that came like a shock,
it’s a promise you’re giving me ♫

520
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,730
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

521
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:11,830
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫

522
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:18,380
♫ The first time I saw your smile, my heart fell for you,
it must be destiny ♫

523
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:24,660
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

524
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,200
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings and let the stars
fulfill each of your dreams ♫

525
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,630
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are
the four seasons that belong to me ♫

526
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:43,720
♫ This moment has a scent like honey, it is the signal
you are giving me ♫

♫ Your embrace is like an island engulfed by a warm breeze ♫

528
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,630
♫ The first time I was certain of your feelings,
I couldn’t believe it and tears came to my eyes ♫

529
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:03,650
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise and take
you traveling ♫

530
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:09,880
♫ This moment has a scent like the sweet sea breeze ♫

531
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,910
♫ It is the signal you are giving me ♫

532
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:23,100
♫ This moment when your smile is like the sun ♫

533
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:30,530
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

534
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:36,710
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫
