[Episode 5]

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,820
Master Tang, where did Huan-huan go?

19
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,740
She went to her elective class.

20
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,260
Club President.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,860
Hey, everyone!

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,450
Let's give a round of applause to welcome

23
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,360
LUU Inline Skating Club's hero, Tang Xue!

24
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,940
It's all thanks to you; otherwise, the Inline skating club would never have been seen as so impressive.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,100
I'll say a few words.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,880
The meal today is to especially thank our classmate, Tang Xue.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,750
We relied on her in yesterday's fight.

28
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,440
You could say it established our inline skating club's inside position.

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,850
So, you should all dig in and eat. I'm paying.

30
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,380
- Thank you, Club President.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,140
- Have a seat, sit.
- Okay, I'll sit here.

32
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,930
The club president just praised you like that. You're something else.

33
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,250
When are you going on the ice?

34
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,020
Enough, Master Tang. Don't make fun of me.

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,710
I can't even manage to roller skate, much less on ice. If it weren't for you this time, I'd have been a laughingstock.

36
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,160
Let's discuss something. The two of us won't join the club for now.

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,030
I'm afraid next time, we'll get you into even bigger trouble.

38
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,730
Thank you.

39
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,520
Tang Xue, order whatever you want!

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,060
Okay!

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,760
If Li Yubing were here, then I would order some

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,860
shredded pork with green peppers, wood-ear stir-fry with carrots. Make him nauseous.

43
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,040
But anyway, he's not here. I'll order some healthy greens,

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,500
dishes with high-protein.

45
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,400
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,190
- Is something wrong?
- I was the one that called Ice God over.

47
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,590
Club President.

48
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,650
I thought you weren't coming.

49
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,840
I had to come.

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,050
There's a spot there. Come with me.

51
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,420
It's okay, I'll sit here.

52
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,200
Let's go. We'll sit together.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,140
The two of us can sit over here.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,380
Move over that way a little.

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,270
Move over that way a little.

56
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,310
Exactly what are you doing coming here?

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,770
Same as you. I was invited.

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,480
Okay. The food's all here. Let's eat!

59
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,090
Peel the shrimp for me.

60
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,210
Go away.

61
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,260
¥1 for one.

62
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,560
Continue to go away.

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,490
- ¥5
- Over and over, go away!

64
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,620
¥10... ¥15... ¥20... ¥25

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,210
Sorry about that.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,130
Come out.

67
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,600
Continue eating.

68
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,350
Li Yubing, if you have some sickness, go back and find a cure.

69
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,420
As we're from the same hometown and elementary classmate, I want to warn you. Man is born good.

70
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,200
If you have any intentions, then you can get out of here. If you really want to play with my patience then prepare yourself.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,750
Okay then. Peel the shrimp for me, ¥50 for one.

72
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,610
What are you trying to do?

73
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,420
Tang Xue, don't think that I don't know what you're thinking.

74
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,380
He is still a child. How can you make a move on him?

75
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,010
You're talking about Yu Yan?

76
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,130
Let's not even start on whether I want to make a move on him... What does this have to do with you?

77
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,460
I will oppose everything you want.

78
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,060
Okay then, I want to be poor.

79
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,800
Sure, peel shrimp for me and I'll pay you ¥100 for each one.

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,010
Fine!

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,860
Master Tang, your relationship journey is quite perplexing.

82
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,010
You can stop now.

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,560
I said you can stop now, I'm full.

84
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,120
¥7000.

85
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,710
Hey, classmates, since we're done eating and drinking, let's play a game!

86
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,950
Sure!

87
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,480
It's on your account.

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,260
Let's play... Captain Hook!
(Game where one person points at someone and the two people beside them have to row to save them)

89
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,020
Whoever loses does truth or dare. Whoever won't play, drinks.

90
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,150
- Let's go
- Let's start!

91
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,790
- You all know how to play right? Then I-I-I'll start. Captain–
- Yeah.

92
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,980
Hook!

93
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,130
- Row row
- Captain–

94
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,110
Hook.

95
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,020
- Row, row
- Captain

96
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,310
Hook.

97
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,060
Row, row!

98
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,360
Truth or dare?

99
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,650
Truth.

100
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,710
Okay then, do you have any wishes that you've never told anyone?

101
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,920
Is that considered "truth"?

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,490
To go to an aquarium.

103
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,890
Why?

104
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,440
I never got to go when I was a child. So after growing up, I really want to go.

105
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,420
Let's continue.

106
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,090
- Captain Hook.
- Row, row.

107
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,300
Truth. Truth.

108
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,380
What type of girl do you like?

109
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,490
I have to think about this...

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,470
Maybe the girl I like hasn't been born yet. I'll tell you guys when she's born. I'll drink instead.

111
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,200
A narcissist opens the door for a narcissist is...

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,110
a perfect narcissist.

113
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,190
Captain Hook!

114
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,510
Row, row!

115
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,650
Why did you stop ice skating?

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,640
Boring, let's continue.

117
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,110
40!

118
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,980
41.

119
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
43!

120
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,840
Time to go.

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,450
- Time to go.
- Be careful.

122
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,210
Don't forget your stuff! Don't forget your stuff!

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,610
Why did you drink so much when you can't even drink?

124
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,720
Here, here, here.

125
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,500
Sit, sit , sit.

126
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,860
- You can't bike anymore.
- Hey, everyone, listen to me.

127
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,130
Be careful when going home since we all had a few drinks. Send me a message when you get home, okay?

128
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,930
- Okay
- Sure, send a message.

129
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,290
- You can't bike anymore.
- Yu Yan!

130
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,440
Did you hear or not. Yu Yan!

131
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
- I'm right here.
- Be safe. Bye-bye.

132
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,480
- I'll send you home.
- What do you mean "send him home?" You drank so much.

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,130
- Go back home.
- What are you doing?

134
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,460
Bye-bye.

135
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,690
Let's take our bikes and go first.

136
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,480
- Go on. Look after her.
- Okay.

137
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,600
Wait. The kickstand.

138
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,920
Get on.

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
My goodness... You two... My goodness.

140
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,650
I'm pretty heavy.

141
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,730
Stop joking! How am I not able to bring you?

142
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,180
Come on, let's go!

143
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,340
Hey,

144
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,040
- Quickly
- Be careful

145
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,000
Yu Yan!

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,610
I feel that this is not too reliable.

147
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,500
If you're worried then you're worried. Catch up to them and see for yourself.

148
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,160
What am I worried about? If something happens, it's not good for both of us.

149
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,950
Am I really heavy?

150
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,870
You're okay. How tall are you?

151
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm 178 centimeters tall.
(Around 5'8 ft)

152
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,830
Then you're really tall already. You'll keep on growing since you're still young.

153
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,150
I can't grow taller anymore.

154
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,430
Why? People with long legs are really pretty.

155
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,800
If I grow any taller, my balance will be off.

156
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,870
What just happened?

157
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,620
- You're in charge of that.
- Hey...

158
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,680
Are you alive?

159
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,070
Tang Xue, thank you for willing to be my friend.

160
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,280
Don't fuss, buddy.

161
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,940
Up you go.

162
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,270
Get up.

163
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,220
Get up, stop pretending.

164
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,650
I won't go. I'm not going no matter what you say.

165
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,990
I can still keep skating!

166
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,940
I thought I would never skate again or win.

167
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,040
I can still win!

168
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
Such a narcissist!

169
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,760
What's wrong with being a narcissist? The longest relationship I have in this life is with myself.
(T/N: narcissist literally means love myself)

170
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,850
I won't have any rivals either! What's wrong with that?

171
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,000
Let me tell you about the character for love in self-love (narcissist). The top half means weird,

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,910
the bottom half means perverted. Put them together and it means you're a weird pervert.

173
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,770
What am I doing? I should just leave you here.

174
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,620
Wow, pretty impressive. The school really values you.

175
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,380
You're so young and yet they put you in the Foreign Teacher's Apartment.

176
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,170
Are you kidding me?!

177
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,590
Up you go, buddy.

178
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,540
Wow, I've seen through you.

179
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,590
You didn't want to throw up in

180
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,280
your nice apartment.

181
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,400
Professional.

182
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll call someone to pick you up.

183
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,790
Hey, what's your password?

184
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,390
Password!

185
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,950
I must have owed you something.

186
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,930
Buddy.

187
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,510
Wake up and drink some water.

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,850
What time is it? These foreigners really know how to party.

189
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,300
It hurts!

190
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,250
- Let go.
- I want to drink water.

191
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,490
- Let go.
- Try leaving.

192
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,290
What are you doing?

193
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,460
Why do you treat me like this?

194
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,100
Why?

195
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,550
If you had a deskmate like Tang Xue, you'd understand.

196
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,850
I know that you're now the Ice God.

197
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,290
You're very impressive; all high and mighty.

198
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,610
But don't forget...

199
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,870
Back in the day, I was the one that introduced you to playing hockey.

200
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,950
Now you're the Ice God, but what about me?

201
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,290
I'm nothing.

202
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,140
I also ice skated for eight years!

203
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,470
I trained for eight years!

204
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,640
How many eight years are there in a lifetime?

205
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,910
Why did I give up?

206
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,410
So, why did you give up?

207
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,140
Because–

208
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,510
Tang Xue, you're really something! You're good at burping and farting; all your functions are operating well!

209
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,410
You drank too much.

210
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,980
I sent you back in the mi-middle of the night.

211
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,220
You didn't even thank me but threw up all over me.

212
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,250
Taking a shower doesn't cost you that much money!

213
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,840
Why did you have to t-t-treat me like that?

214
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,020
Is there anymore lo-love between classmates?

215
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,900
- So-Sorry.
- Sit down! Sit down.

216
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,710
I didn't know that you would show up in my room so suddenly.

217
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,690
Anyone would've been scared in the same situation.

218
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,600
Listen up.

219
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,840
If it wasn't for Bi-Bing-bing, I wouldn't have carried you home.

220
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,590
Take a look at my clothes,

221
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,490
How can I we-wear them back?

222
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,870
I'll pay you the dry cleaning fee!

223
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,960
No need to be so polite to me.

224
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,480
- I got it dirty, I need to pay for it.
- No need.

225
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,760
How much will you give me?

226
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,270
Are you joking? If you don't have any money, why are you trying to be so polite?

227
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,720
Oh, I got it. I can transfer money to you through my phone.

228
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,010
Forget it! No need.

229
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,370
I'll scan your QR code.

230

¥200 (approx. $28)

Let me see. How much is it?

232
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,830
Are you kidding? You don't even have a bank account connected?

233
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,580
How are you going to transfer it to me? Are you going to transfer it with your brain?

234
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,440
Oh, I need to connect a bank account to this?

Wait, buddy, are you from outer space?

No matter what, I need to thank you for bringing me home.

It's my bedtime. You should head back soon.

I'll find clean clothes for you. Quickly change and go home.

Thanks for sending me to a hotel last night.

Hotel? Who sent you there? Are you okay?

248
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,410
It wasn't you?

249
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,100
Someone sent me home last night, too. Are you sure that you're okay?

250
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Oh yeah! I'm okay, but then who sent me here?

251
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,960
Could it be... Li Yubing?

252
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,080
Impossible, it couldn't be him. Otherwise, he wouldn't have washed my clothes.

253
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,810
It must have been Liao Zhenyu.

254

It doesn't matter who sent you, as long as you're okay.

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,110
Yours.

319
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,110
Wow, this color matches me pretty well.

320
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,720
Mint green.
(T/N: mint green is "lu bing" in Chinese; sounds like his name)

321
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,250
Thanks.

322
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,850
Do you like it?

323
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,030
- We all have the same.
- Thanks.

324
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,430
Don't thank me. That's too polite. I was buying myself one and just bought extra.

325
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,820
That's right! We three have great camaraderie...

326
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,050
like this material itself. Stainless steel.

327
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,840
Stainless? I think you're quite pretty.
(T/N: stain and pretty sound similar)

328
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,530
Why are you more and more revoltingly intimate? My God, hurry up and eat.

329
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,280
Disgusting. Hurry up and eat! I'm starving.

330
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,400
[Female Dormitory]

331
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:26,240
I mean, you see, I turned into an internet star just after one night.

332
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,300
But really, from morning to night, it really is too much.

333
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,600
I've been picking up so many calls that callouses are forming in my ears.

334
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,460
But I'm holding you guys accountable.

335
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,540
If anyone exposes my phone number, Wechat ID, or other social media again,

336
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,680
I will put your phone numbers on marriage ads!

337
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,240
Master Tang, do you think you're the only one with troubles?

338
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,700
You have blocked all your friend requests, but my phone has exploded!

339
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,240
Look.

340
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,280
Hello? How are you?

341
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,840
You want to be friends with Tang Xue?

342
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,220
How about leaving some information and I'll record it, okay?

343
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,740
Oh, in the finance department?

344
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,460
In your third year?

345
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,180
A double degree? You're a Capricorn? Okay.

346
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,450
A house under your name?

347
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,150
Hey, did I ask you that question?

348
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,890
Do you think we're that shallow?

349
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,770
What type of building is it?

350
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,950
Hi. Hello!

351
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,330
Hello, classmate.

352
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,910
Literature department?

353
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,410
Hey, bro, what's with your accent?

354
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,610
NC machine tool...
(T/N: Numerical Control Machine Tool)

355
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,320
Oh, sorry about that, you're a student from abroad!

356
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,350
Classmate, I've already told you, I recorded it down.

357
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,810
We'll talk later, okay?

358
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,010
Not that. I noted them all already. I will tell her, okay?

359
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,910
Okay, we'll talk later. Bye-bye, okay, okay. Bye-bye.

360
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,440
I can't answer any more calls. If I pick up any more phone calls, I'll start cursing.

361
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,530
They even dare to call here on Old Ye's phone! I'll pick it up!

362
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,740
Hello?

363
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,370
Let me tell you. I don't care who you are, what your purpose is,

364
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,850
but from now on, don't call us to annoy us. Okay?

365
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,050
That one was even more amusing. He immediately started saying kung pao chicken or something.

366
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,020
It upsets me.

367
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,970
You... t-that might have been the takeout I ordered.

368
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,570
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

369
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,920
Honestly, Master Tang.

370
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,370
You look so cool when you skate. When will you teach us?

371
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,100
Coming.

372
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,560
There's training again?

373
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,780
Woah, Autobot.

374
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,620
After you're done training, can we go on and skate for a little bit?

375
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,610
We're using the outside circle, you guys can play in the inside ring. It doesn't affect us.

376
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,390
- Really?
- Of course, it is the Autobot's privilege!

377
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,720
- Yeah.
- Come in.

378
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,170
- Thanks.
- Come on in.

379
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,690
Thank you!

380
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,760
- Woa.h
- Wow, you're so good at skating.

381
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,820
Now that I've demonstrated the moves and explained them,

382
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,590
the rest is up to you and your understanding.

383
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,020
Don't worry, Master Tang. I won't fall.

384
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,030
Lower your center of gravity, low!

385
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,860
Lower.

386
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,370
Hand. Hand.

387
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,670
The most important thing when learning how to skate is not being afraid of falling.

388
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,080
What's wrong with falling?

389
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,250
Master Tang, your skating was amazing just then.

390
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,270
Think about those in the off-campus inline skating club,

391
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,920
If he knew you were this good, would he still dare to make a bet with you?

392
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,400
And streaking, did he dare?

393
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,200
Ignorant! Childish!

394
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,820
I'll skate for you guys one more time.

395
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's go, Master Tang. Let's go!

396
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,420
Woah, who's this? She's so much faster than our Master Tang.

397
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,630
Look, he's here to inspect again.

398
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,940
It's her again.

399
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,690
- Zhang Yuewei is so cool!
- Too cool!

400
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,940
- Sister Wei, so skilled!
- Sister Wei, amazing!

401
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,570
- Sister Wei!
- Sister Yuewei, you're amazing!

402
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,970
Master Tang.

403
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,610
Master Tang, who is that?

404
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,800
She can actually be that much faster than Master Tang.

405
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:50,840
Sister Wei, this is the Autobot who won the roller skating contest a few days ago.

406
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,390
She's pretty skilled.

407
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,140
Don't be disheartened, Autobot.

408
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,130
Zhang Yuewei is the captain of our short track speed skating team.

409
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,280
Losing to her isn't anything to be embarrassed about.

410
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,750
Yeah, for an amateur like you,

411
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,250
just being able to compete with pros like us should be enough for you.

412
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,740
Is losing or winning still important?

413
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,910
Amateur?

414
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,190
It's true, I haven't been an athlete in a long time.

415
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,470
What right do I have to be here, acting so full of myself?

416
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,350
- Hey, Master Tang!
- Master Tang! Master Tang!

417
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,410
- Hey, Master Tang!
- Master Tang!

418
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,050
Hurry up! Where are you going?

419
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,030
Master Tang, you don't need to care too much about today's result.

420
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,850
The one you lost to is Zhang Yuewei, that's not something to be embarrassed about.

421
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,170
She's an athlete that is famous in the whole city.

422
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,040
Exactly. A cultured person is still more superior even if they lost.
(T/N: lit. a scrawny camel is still bigger than a horse)

423
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,690
There's nothing that always stays the same–

424
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,450
Anyway, you're already very great, Master Tang, really.

425
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,820
There are so many brainless people on earth, why are you the leader of all of them?

426
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,000
Eat.

427
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,930
Yes. To think that I was behind Zhang Yuewei by almost a whole lap. How could I skate so slowly?

428
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,740
It's impossible. It's definitely impossible.

429
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,110
This isn't my true ability.

430
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,610
You two... See?

431
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,360
I said so, she must be hungry after seeing us eat.

432
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,370
I'm leaving first.

433
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,620
You're not eating anymore?

434
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,000
For an amateur like you,

435
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,520
just being able to compete with pros like us should be enough for you.

436
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,940
Is losing or winning still important?

437
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,040
[00:58]

438
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,310
Nice, nice! Athlete Tang Xue won first place!

439
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,470
48.909 seconds!

440
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,750
A new city high school record has been born!

441
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,740
Let's congratulate her!

442
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,100
[48.909 seconds]

443
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,510
You did great, Tang Xue. If you keep improving at this rate,

444
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,220
you can definitely join the national team in the future!

445
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,550
Tang Xue.

446
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,790
What are you doing here?

447
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,910
I was resting for a bit.

448
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,530
You're done practicing?

449
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,690
Yeah, I'm done with practice. Let's leave together.

450
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,910
You skate so well, it must've been very difficult when you were training.

451
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,790
My childhood was almost all spent at the ice rink.

452
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,900
No wonder you haven't been to the aquarium before.

453
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,920
But it makes sense.

454
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,630
It's not that easy to be a champion. If you want to be better than other people,

455
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,000
you have to work harder than other people.

456
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,880
Just working hard isn't enough. You also have to learn endurance.

457
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,580
Sometimes, I waver.

458
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,080
I want to cut corners or give up.

459
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,830
But every time I look back on my journey,

460
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,870
I think about everything I've gone through up to this point and then I don't want to give up anymore.

461
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,290
I want to see how much longer I can endure, how much farther I can go.

462
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,110
You will definitely go farther and farther.

463
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,560
I have faith in you. You'll definitely go very far, farther and farther.

464
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,580
You can definitely become the world champion.

465
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,810
Then, what about you? You like ice skating so much.

466
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,740
Why did you choose veterinary medicine as your major?

467
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,900
It's a long story.

468
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,930
In short, I had a moment of hotheadedness

469
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,780
and I gave up my 8 years of ice skating.

470
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,790
By the time I calmed down, there was no going back.

471
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,340
Maybe this is what it means to not have fate with your dreams.

472
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,240
Does that mean you don't want to give up yet?

473
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,000
Then you can start training again.

474
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,850
As we pursue our dreams, everyone will have times where they fall back along the way.

475
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,770
It's like high jump or archery.

476
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,590
You step back so you can jump higher or shoot farther.

477
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,000
Can... I?

478
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,340
Once you decide to commit to something, everyone will step aside and support you.

479
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,820
Let's go.

480
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,470
Hello?

481
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,760
Get up, my training buddy.

482
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,350
What? Training buddy?

483
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,860
Tang Xue.

484
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,600
I heard that yesterday you competed with Zhang Yuewei from the short track speed skating team.

485
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,620
I heard you lost pretty badly.

486
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,330
It's none of your business.

487
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,340
Based on the club's opinion and my personal observations,

488
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,750
we unanimously agree that you have the qualities to become a professional training buddy.

489
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,160
So you are no longer just my assistant, you are also my personal training buddy.

490
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,360
You've got it wrong! How can I, a little girl, be a training buddy for a guy like you?

491
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,430
Don't be humble. You, a little girl, can even beat a guy.

492
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,790
Li Yubing, are you determined to mess with me?

493
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,550
Whatever you say.

494
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,180
Anyway, you're bound to the contract with the club.

495
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,350
Your job is to support me. Whatever I plan, that's what you have to do.

496
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,390
Fine, one month.

497
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,920
[Childhood story]

498
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,480
Son, let's just go in and take a look, okay?

499
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,630
Let's just go inside and take one look.

500
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,760
Okay?

501
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,130
What if you like it? Look.

502
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,390
Look at how many other kids are skating. It's great.

503
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,950
It's pointless.

504
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,970
Just go, okay?

505
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,020
- Mommy Li, you guys are here.
- Hello.

506
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,260
We came. I dragged him here because he kept saying he didn't want to come.

507
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,850
My kid is good at everything, he just doesn't like sports.

508
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,190
We can't have that.

509
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,410
Kids are growing right now so they especially need to exercise more.

510
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,750
You're right. That's why I brought him here to feel the excitement.

511
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,220
Yubing, let's just go and see. Okay? Tang Xue is inside, too.

512
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,660
- Let's just go and see what it's like, okay? Be good. What if you like it?
- Come, just try it out.

513
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,960
We'll just stand at the side and look inside, okay?

514
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,950
Come on, be good. Slowly, be careful. Don't fall.

515
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,090
Take your time. We'll just see what it's like, okay?

516
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,250
- Take your time.
- Hold onto the wall.

517
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,240
- Good boy.
- Okay, start.

518
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,860
Yubing, when someone else falls down, it's fine to not help them up.

519
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,120
But how can you laugh at that kind of thing? You're not being sensible.

520
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,410
Mom, I like ice skating. It seems like a lot of fun.

521
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:01,780
