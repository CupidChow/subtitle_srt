[Episode 33]

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,600
Xiao Yu must have encountered a problem.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,000
A man's mouth is made to lie.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,900
Though he normally acts as if he's plain and honest,

21
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,800
he still has the potential to be a jerk.

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,000
A man who lost his ax suspected his neighbor's son of stealing it.
(T/N: a saying meaning don't judge a book by its cover)

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,800
The man thought the son's way of walking looked like a thief.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,800
The man thought the son's expression and way of speaking looked like a thief.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
All his gestures and actions proclaimed him guilty as the thief.

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,300
I don't understand it.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,200
What I mean is you should stop making needless guesses.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
Because then, no matter how you look at Xiao Yu, he'll always be a problem.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
But he lied to me, this is proof!

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,700
What if it's just a misunderstanding?

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,200
It's going to be fine once you've cleared up the misunderstanding. As the old saying goes,

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,300
"Catch a thief with a lot in his hands. Catch a cheater with both parties present."

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
You're right.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
There's no use with me just blind guessing.

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,400
I have to find out the truth. What is he doing behind my back exactly?

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Can't he have secrets?

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,700
What did you say?

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Between couples, can't there be some secrets?

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,200
In psychology studies, it is said that being frank is still better.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,600
However deep the feeling is, it can't withstand any suspicion.

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Here you go, customers! Have some candy!

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Eat some candy! Come!

43
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
No need to rush.

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Where did you get these candies? Wedding candies?

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
What wedding candies? Who will I marry?

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Come here!

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,400
You know how a group of kids came to visit our ice hockey team today?

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,400
This "wedding candy" is from them and only I got them.

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
Why?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Why? Because I'm handsome, that's why.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,400
- You handsome? Bing-bing is handsome and he didn't get any.
- Just eat the candy.

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Who told you two to run away immediately when you saw the kids?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There was a little boy today, I gave him a few pointers and he was so happy.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,900
Then he gave me his whole box of candy. That kid was so cute.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,400
What's wrong, Bing-bing? Moping around isn't your style.

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Here, have a taste of me. Stop sighing, all right?

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,300
- Bitter.
- Bitter?

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,800
It's not bitter.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
It's bitter that we can't even see each other.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,700
Originally, I thought

61
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,300
that this experience of a long-distance relationship

62
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,000
would only come after she goes into training for the national team.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400
But who knew that it would happen ahead of schedule.

64
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,800
Surely LUU isn't so big that you can't even see her.

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
I know. We had a date but she flaked.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If she's not seeing Consort Meng today, then she's seeing Old Ye tomorrow.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm upset.

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Oh my goodness.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,400
You really are the XDragons Jealous King. You are even jealous of women.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm starting to doubt myself now.

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm starting to doubt whether I'm important or not in her heart.

72

Doubts in your relationship? Teacher Deng is here to answer your questions.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,800
It's no big deal. As long as the feeling is still there,

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
it's fine if you can't see her for a few days.

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm telling you...

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Blah blah blah. Finish brushing your teeth and then speak!

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Love needs trust.

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Right? Men need to be magnanimous.

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,900
Dessert after a meal! It's finally time for me to show off.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
Dessert can make people happy. Are you looking forward to this?

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Can you do it?

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,700
Of course.

83

Failure is the mother of success.

What is that?

141
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,100
My ancestor, what are you doing? You almost scared me to death.

142
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,800
This is a medical mannequin. This is a dummy model.

143
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,800
The team doctor told me to get familiarized with a human body's meridians and acupuncture points.

144
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,500
She said that it would help with treatment and nursing later on.

145
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,000
So I memorized the meridians on the medical mannequin.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000

Last time you clearly weren't in the classroom but you insisted that you were in the classroom.

158
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,500
Is there something that you're hiding from me?

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I was here.

160
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,000
How dare you still say you were there?

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,800
When I called you, I was right outside of your classroom.

162
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,500
Outside of my classroom?

163
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,500
Come here.

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is a practice classroom. That room over there is our seminar classroom.

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,700
This is an anatomy classroom.

167
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,200
The other day, which classroom were you outside of?

168
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,800
So you mean, you were at this classroom the other day? I thought you were at the seminar classroom.

169
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,000
My dear sister, this is medical school. A medical school.

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Do you think there is only one teaching classroom?

171
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,300
That's because you didn't make yourself clear.

172
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,500
All right, fine. It's all my fault for not making it clear.

173
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,200
Tell me. Why did you come here?

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,600
I just wanted to tell you that...

175

We need to trust each other more, okay?

176
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
All right.

I'm sorry to tell you... You just got stood up. My condolence.

189
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,100
Did she say anything else?

190
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,700
Nothing, just that something came up and she'll see you later.

Listen to my words. Listen to Teacher Deng.

203

Be more concerned about it. You don't have to take it to heart,

204
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,800
but when necessary, file a report or a complaint.

205
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,200
What's the point of concerning myself with them? The things these haters say...

Everyone aren't idiots, they'll be forgotten sooner or later. No need to worry about them.

Why are you such a clingy boyfriend? Where's the cool Ice God?

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000

Big Brother, is that not enough?

222

You're stuck to our Master Tang every day, we barely even get to see her anymore.

223
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,200
How about this? Give her some days off and let us play with her for a while. Right?

The longest distance in the world isn't between life and death.

Ever since Yan-yan's dad left,

274
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,280
I had to take care of him myself.

275
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,780
At that time, I told myself,

Luckily, Yan-yan was a good boy and would listen to me.

279

And he was doing better and better in figure skating.

I felt really content.

Actually, when I was younger, I was also a figure skater.

282
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,300
But I later retired because of my injuries.

283
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,730
If I didn't retire, I might have become a champion in figure skating.

284
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,760
Maybe because of my regret, I hoped Yan-yan could help me accomplish it.

285
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,490
These years, apart from figure skating,

286
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,890
I wouldn't let him think about anything or let him do anything.

287
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,810
I only cared about his achievements in figure skating

288
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,280
and ignored his emotions.

289
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,800
I would always put my regret and dream on Yan-yan's shoulders.

290
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,350
That's why Yan-yan fell ill.

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,130
I went to meet another friend.

316
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,420
But...

317
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:06,240
But there are some things I promised that friend that I wouldn't tell anyone about.

318
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,510
To you, it might seem hard to understand. But you just need to believe,

319
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,750
no matter what happens, we will never change.

320
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,610
Tang Xue.

321
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,700
Let's break up.

322
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,690
Why?

323
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,350
Because there is someone that's more important than me.

324
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,360
Isn't that so?

325
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,220
Do you really not trust me?

326
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,180
Li Yubing!

327
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,760
I've given you a chance.

328
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:19,140
Fine then, let's break up. Whoever wants to get back together is a dog!

329
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,340
What happened?

330
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,200
Did you and Tang Xue get in an argument?

331
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,110
Why did you guys argue?

332
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,670
Because she stood you up?

333
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,080
Arguing isn't that scary.

334
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,600
When couples fight, a small one enhances feelings, a big one harms the body.

335
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,620
Listen to Teacher Deng's advice.

336
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,840
Once you're done being upset, go and make up with Tang Xue.

337
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,060
She has to leave for training soon.

338
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,010
After that, you won't be able to fight even if you want to.

339
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,460
There's no later.

340
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,920
Bing-bing. Bing-bing?

341
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,030
Bing-bing, what exactly happened?

342
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,540
You should take off your shoes if you're going to bed.

343
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,060
Broke up? Why?

344
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,590
He doesn't even understand that he is the most important person to me.

345
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,780
Is Li Yubing crazy? Fighting is normal, why would he go and say "break up"?

346
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,570
Tang Xue, why did you argue and break up?

347
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,520
This isn't good. You have to leave for training soon.

348
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,840
You can't take these emotions when you go.

349
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,040
I'm telling you! You have to go explain things clearly to Li Yubing.

350
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,290
It's easy for two people to get together, managing a relationship is what's difficult.

351
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,660
Do you remember when I had that misunderstanding about Xiao Yu?

352
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,400
Clearing the air is a good thing.

353
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,420
Tang Xue.

354
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,610
Thank you.

355
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,800
Are you okay? Why are you so listless?

356
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,520
I'm fine.

357
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,090
Are you going to the training center?

358
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,950
You don't need to come and see me these days.

359
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,600
Why?

360
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,040
I know you still have a lot to do.

361
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,140
You can't just always be here with me.

362
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,610
Don't worry. I still have my mom.

363
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,280
Do your best.

364
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,880
I hope that the next time I see you, you'll be an official member of the national team.

365
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,540
You need to do your best, too.

366
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,320
I hope that the next time I see you, you'll be the Little Sheep I knew when I first met you.

367
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,790
Tang Xue,

368
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:01,720
there's something I've hidden in my heart for a long time.

369
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,020
I like you. I've liked you for a long time.

370
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,410
My life used to seem like it was in black and white.

371
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,990
When I met you, my life suddenly became full of color.

372
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,250
You are so interesting, so brave.

373
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,440
I envy how you dare to challenge my mother;

374
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,730
envy how you can control your blades;

375
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,960
envy how you pursue your own dream so fearlessly.

376
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,180
I want to be like you. So I was deeply attracted to you.

377
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,260
When I found out that you and Li Yubing were together,

378
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,680
I hated Li Yubing for stealing you away.

379
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,390
I hated my mother for thwarting me. I hated everyone.

380
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,440
I even hated you for not waiting for me.

381
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,160
I myself transformed that love and became extreme and stubborn.

382
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,230
Hiding it inside, I gradually lost control.

383
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,040
But during these days when things got out of control, I've seen a lot of things more clearly.

384
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,860
Those qualities that I've admired in you...

385
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,420
I can actually do those, too.

386
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,970
But instead, I chose to become irritable

387
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,520
and couldn't face my true self.

388
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,530
I have to face the fact that I failed in that competition.

389
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,280
I also have to face the fact that the person you like

390
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,380
is Li Yubing.

391
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,450
I can tell you these things now

392
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,830
because I've let go.

393
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,060
I've really let go,

394
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,390
especially after eating the cake you made.

395
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,140
Looks like without my cake, you wouldn't have gotten better.

396
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,560
This morning, I took Yu Yan for another check-up.

397
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,610
The doctor said his recovery is going well.

398
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,510
Now, you don't have to worry anymore.

399
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,320
Thank you. Without you,

400
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,840
Yu Yan wouldn't have recovered so quickly.

401
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,550
Thinking about it now,

402
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,440
I really think that the way I acted towards you...

403
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,570
you mustn't take it to heart.

404
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,150
If I could go back in time,

405
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,400
I really wish I hadn't prevented you and Yu Yan from dating.

406
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,000
Auntie, Yu Yan and I

407
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,800
have always just been good friends.

408
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,090
I know.

409
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,490
I still regret it very much.

410
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,180
However, seeing how well you and Li Yubing are suited to one another,

411
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,140
it makes me very happy. You two must be happy in the future.

412
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,260
We broke up.

413
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,750
Wh... Why?

414
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,890
Is it because he's misunderstood?

415
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,930
Because I asked you to keep a secret?

416
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,980
That's all my fault.

417
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,740
I was only thinking of myself; I neglected to think of your situation.

418
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,620
I was too selfish.

419
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,560
Auntie, you did it for Yu Yan's good; you wanted to protect him.

420
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,000
You can tell Li Yubing

421
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,220
about Yan-yan's situation.

422
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,590
- What shall we eat?
- Anything is fine.

423
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,620
Li Yubing, let's talk.

424
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,220
I have to practice.

425
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,910
Big Jiang, let's go.

426
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,210
Bing-bing, that was so accurate.

427
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,190
I'll try, too.

428
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,290
All the media is reporting that

429
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,190
our competition with Black Scorpions

430
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,350
is the ultimate battle of this season.

431
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,850
I hope everyone devotes yourself 100% and beats this scorpion.

432
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,110
The opponents after them are not as strong, okay?

433
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,820
We'll win all the games

434
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,520
and aim to get the Champion Cup.

435
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,220
Well said!

436
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,140
Despite Manager Ma's words, we have to be cautious.

437
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,660
We still have several games after this.

438
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,640
We have to be serious and careful. Understood?

439
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,490
Understood.

440
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,530
Li Yubing.

441
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,900
Especially you, don't be affected by all the online gossip.

442
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,860
Practice hard.

443
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,450
Okay.

444
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,800
Yubing, why do I feel you're a distracted these days?

445
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,970
Are you not feeling well?

446
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,820
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

447
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,060
- Are you really okay?
- Really.

448
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,180
I probably just didn't sleep well.

449
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,120
The game is tomorrow. You need to maintain your condition.

450
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,590
- All right, go back and rest more.
- Okay.

451
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,070
Why are these kids so disheartened recently?

452
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,970
Who knows? Relationship troubles?

453
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,470
Youth anxiety. I don't have it.

454
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,410
I've always been extremely committed. Isn't that right, Xiao Xia?

455
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,410
Old Jin. Old Jin, don't worry.

456
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,650
You'll be confused forever later on.

457
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,830
Okay. Good luck. You are the fattest.

458
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,270
[SECRET]

459
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,020
Brother Tie.

460
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,940
It's just you?

461
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,930
How come you are, too?

462
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,210
They're about to have a competition so they have the big task of training diligently.

463
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,550
All right.

464
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,410
Today is...

465
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,660
Do you want the usual or something new?

466
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,600
- The usual.
- Sure.

467
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,950
Oh right.

468
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,840
When are you going to the group training?

469
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,460
I'm leaving tomorrow.

470
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,360
Time really flies.

471
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,700
- It really does.
- Okay.

472
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,090
Today's meal will be on me.

473
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,470
Just take it as my farewell meal to

474
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,760
the future national team member, okay?

475
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,550
Brother Tie, aren't you afraid of us making you go bankrupt if you keep treating us to meals?

476
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,230
For national team members like you,

477
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,350
treating them to a meal, treating you, I'm proud to do so.

478
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,990
But it's not for nothing. Do you best there.

479
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,780
Otherwise, I'll make you pay for every meal.

480
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,450
Yes, Sir.

481
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,970
Grandma, this time,

482
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:22,730
I'll definitely fulfill your wish.

483
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,370
[If the person you like doesn't like you back, what do you do?]

484
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,600
[If the person you like doesn't like you back, what do you do?]

485
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,900
[I will secretly watch over them.]

486
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:19,510
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

487
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:26,820
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

488
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:33,560

493
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,700
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

494
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,670

you are protecting ♫

495

it must be destiny ♫

499
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,530
♫ I want to hold your hand and travel to the rainbow
to pluck a star ♫

500
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:41,270

fulfill each of your dreams ♫
