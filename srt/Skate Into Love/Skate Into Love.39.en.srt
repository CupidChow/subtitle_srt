19
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,600
What did the doctor say?

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,760
You can't rush when it comes to training.

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,340
You have to be patient and take everything one step at a time.

22
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,480
The doctor also said that I recover faster than most people.

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,890
Can you let me worry less?

24
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,220
Do you really think you're a god? You're doing such intense training.

25
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,340
Do you need me to tell you how big of a risk it is?

26

But right now,

27
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,920
I can't even hold a hockey stick steady.

Oh right. Thank you for reminding me.

I also believe that no matter if it's Coach Xu,

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Old Deng, Big Jiang, or your other teammates, none of them view you like that.

Everyone wants you to be well and recover quickly.

Did you forget how much effort you put in to get to this step?

You're casually giving it up now?

50

I never said that I would give up short track speed skating.

51

I'm choosing to not go because I'm confident that I can still get in next time.

You once asked me what would happen if we were not the Three Musketeers.

But do you know that you're even more important to me?

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,800
You made her sad.

I just don't want to hold her back.

177

Would it be bad if you asked her to stay?

How can I ask her to give up her dream for me?

I'll convince her.

She's getting better. But you are getting worse.

184

If she really goes there, maybe the distance between you two will become bigger and bigger.

If she can become better,

I'll see her off.

How do you plan on convincing her?

00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,500
- for all the commercial contracts?
- Yes.

325
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,960
This bit of sales is not a big deal.

326
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,450
Next season, I plan on doubling our advertisement revenue.

327
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,940
Keep growing Ice God's commercial value.

328
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,140
Increase the profit for our club.

329
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,650
I'm happy that you have these plans.

330
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,330
We need to reconsider

331
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,920
Ice God's commercial value.

332
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,830
Look at Clause 12.

333
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,860
What is this?

334
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,020
[If Party B negatively affect Party A or its reputation, Party B pays ¥200K as a penalty.]

335
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,970
What? Penalty? It's unreasonable.

336
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,160
Besides his injury, Li Yubing had negative news.

337
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,530
Advertisers are holding us accountable.

338
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,030
He was hired to promote their brands. They expect a profit.

339
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,310
He can't do anything now, not even competing on the rink.

340
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,550
We've violated the contract.

341
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,690
The penalty has been paid through accounting.

342
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,920
I'll pay for it, but

343
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,330
Li Yubing has to leave.

344
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,890
What? You are firing him?

345
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,700
Yes.

346
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,570
Absolutely not. Chairman!

347
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,740
Chairman, listen to me.

348
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,860
Chairman, we can't do this.

349
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,480
It's the toughest time for Li Yubing right now.

350
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,700
Xiaoshan, you have to understand. We are running a business, not a charity.

351
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,710
We need players that can bring us values.

352
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,040
Not burdens. Besides, we have Song Anjie.

353
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,900
No. I won't fire Li Yubing.

354
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,590
You won't agree? Why?

355
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,690
- I'll pay the penalty.
- You'll pay?

356
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,880
Your money comes from me.

357
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,960
All right, you pay for it.

358
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,710
I'll consider keeping him.

359
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,210
- I'll give you five days.
- No problem.

360
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,610
Secretary Jin, stop Manager Ma's credit card.

361
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,800
- Immediately.
- Okay.

362
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,460
Dad!

363
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,170
Take care of it yourself if you're so ambitious.

364
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,000
Manager Ma, you truly kept an extremely low profile.

365
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,480
Yeah. With your status, most people can't wait to announce it with a loudspeaker.

366
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,470
But you are hiding it.

367
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,830
I got the job because of my ability, not through connections.

368
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:25,200
All my life, this is the only thing I wanted to devote myself to, no matter how hard.

369
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,260
I dreamed of running this club successfully.

370
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,980
But one side is my dad and the other side is my little ancestor.

371
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,530
I had to smooth many things over because of it.

372
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,530
We misunderstood you.

373
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,750
Sorry.

374
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,920
Did you know?

375
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,000
I've imagined this scene many times.

376
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,150
One day, you find out that I'm very capable, but I'm rich.

377
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,090
Right. It's like a TV show. In the show,

378
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,480
one is capable and... a rich...

379
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,360
- CEO.
- Are you a cartoon character?

380
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,960
Can we talk about something serious? What about Bing-bing's matter?

381
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,320
My dad stopped my card.

382
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,000
How about we put all our pocket money together? That'll be enough.

383
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,970
Drop it already. I lend you money to pay for take-out every day.

384
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,790
Bing-bing lends me money. We don't have any money.

385
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,080
I got it!

386
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,720
My dad stopped my card.

387
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,390
I still have my car.

388
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,730
- That... would not be polite.
- What's not polite about that?

389
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,540
Bing-bing's matter is Manager Ma's matter.

390
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,940
- How much is it?
- No idea.

391
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,410
Thank you, Manager Ma. Chairman asked me to take your car.

392
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,700
My dad only said to stop by card, not take my car!

393
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,770
The card has to be stopped and the car has to be taken. I'm sorry, Manager Ma.

394
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,600
- Stop!
- Give it back!

395
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,410
I don't know what to do about Bing-bing's matter. We have to think of something.

396
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,380
Whatever takes you one day will take me three days to figure out.

397
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,330
You still have to think. We have to tell Li Yubing.

398
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,680
Okay. You tell him.

399
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,450
I... can't.

400
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,290
- You do it.
- Manager Ma said he'd take care of it.

401
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,300
Be patient. I have a date. I have to go now.

402
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,000
A date with whom? Your spring is here?
(T/N: spring is another way of saying love life/significant other)

403
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,660
Are you so happy you're floating to the sky? Are your bros more important or...

404
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,870
those more important?

405
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,740
Both are important. I'll be right back.

406
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,000
You...

407
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,420
I ordered you ice cream. Go ahead.

408
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,900
I don't want it.

409
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,720
What's wrong?

410
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,290
Did someone bully you?

411
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,020
I want someone to stay with me for a while.

412
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,560
Are there always hardships that

413
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,710
one cannot handle on her own?

414
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,810
Hardships?

415
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,380
Did something happen at home?

416
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,340
Did someone scam your money?

417
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:45,220
Did someone hurt you emotionally?

418
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,020
Did you get a terminal illness?

419
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,300
I got second place on exams.

420
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,600
What's wrong with second place?

421
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,490
If I got second place,

422
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,640
I'd celebrate so hard.

423
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,190
My mom would even give me a red envelope.

424
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,960
I've never gotten second on exams.

425
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,630
Stop crying. They'll think I'm upsetting you.

426
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,290
Are you all right? Don't cry.

427
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,330
I'm not crying.

428
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,700
Besides, who can be number one every day?

429
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,480
You've only dropped one place.

430
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,090
Think of Yubing. He is the LUU Ice God.

431
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,600
He just had brain surgery.

432
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,040
And now the club is firing him.

433
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,590
He fell from number one to the last place.

434
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:50,130
Think of him. Your stuff is nothing.

435
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,080
Li Yubing is getting fired?

436
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,460
What is he going to do?

437
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,540
He is about to be fired. Don't worry! We're thinking of a solution.

438
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,650
How can we help?

439
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,430
What can you do? We guys can take care of it.

440
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,460
Poor Li Yubing.

441
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,230
Why are we both so miserable?

442
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,300
Stop crying.

443
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,780
Why are you crying again?

444
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,100
Please stop.

It's cold in Beijing. Take more thick clothes with you, got it?

447
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,990
Look at these.

451
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,090
I need to go buy accident insurance. Sooner or later, she'll give me a heart attack.

Tang Xue...

453
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,960
I have something to tell you. You need to be prepared.

Go ahead.

00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:59,190
♫ As if I’m nibbling a juicy peach, a beautiful love blossoms ♫

480
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:05,450
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
(only you can understand) ♫

481
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:12,720
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

482
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,100
♫ The first time I held your hand, my breathing
became erratic and I was so mesmerized ♫

483
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,120
♫ The courage to hold you tight and never be apart again ♫

484
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,090
♫ Loving with no reason when I met you ♫
