00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,700
We are submitting nominations for the best coach. This is the application form.

160
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,500
You three fill in the form, please.

161
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,600
Okay.

162
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,010
Manager Ma,

163
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I won't participate this year.

164
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
What?

165
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,330
I'm not participating.

166
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,400
Old Jin, you enter into the Best Coach evaluation every year.

167
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,800
- What going on this year?
- Yeah.

168
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Look at the Best Coach medals you've collected, you are close to summoning the divine dragon.

169
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,900
And you're not participating?

170
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,400
To be honest,

171
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
I think I'm not qualified.

172
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,500
I've won all these medals over the years but I only found out today

173
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,800
that there are things more important than getting medals.

174
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,600
Thanks.

175
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
Coach Jin.

176
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yu Yan, what's wrong?

177
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,600
I heard that you are not participating in the evaluation for Best Coach?

178
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,300
I gave it up.

179
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,900
Is it because of me?

180
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
It does have a bit to do with you.

181
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,400
But it's not because of my guilt towards you.

182
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,000
It's that you allowed me to realize if I give up on that medal,

183
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,700
I can whole-heartedly focus on the training

184
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,100
of all my team members.

185
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
By doing so,

186
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,400
I can reach somewhere higher than the Best Coach.

187
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you agree,

188
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
my figure skating champion?

189
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
But Coach...

190
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Enough, enough.

191
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,270
Do you want some coffee? I added double espresso shots.

192
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,900
- Okay.
- Really? I'm joking with you.

193
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,900
You won't be able to sleep. Go train.

194
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,920
- Okay, I'm going, Coach.
- Off you go.

195
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,900
Those in the back, keep up. Keep up.

196
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,200
Good. Speed up, speed up.

197
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,500
Faster, faster.

198
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,530
I can't take it anymore.

199
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,800
You can choose to keep going or give up.

200
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,300
I can't do it anymore.

201
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,500
Anyone else wants to give up?

202
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,500
I also can't do it anymore.

203
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Okay. I respect your decisions.

204
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,400
You can go and have a rest.

205
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,200
You're the only one who can help yourself.

206
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,700
Only the motivation inside you can drive you forward.

207
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,500
There are no external efforts that can push you forward forever.

208
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,600
If you want to win, you have to rely on your willpower

209
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,300
and ambition. Do not be defeated by

210
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,400
any tiny stress. Do you understand?

211
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,100
Yes.

212
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,600
We will announce the name list of the national team in one week.

213
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,100
I look forward to the final results.

214
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,900
Continue.

215
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,100
Faster, faster. Speed up!

216
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,400
Keep it up. Faster.

217
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,100
Why aren't you letting me play?

218
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,200
Yubing, the club is also doing this for your sake.

219
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
There are so many negative comments about you on the internet.

220
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
If you do poorly again in the next game,

221
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,800
the public opinion of you will be even worse.

222
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,200
That's why I have to play.

223
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I can't be like a coward and not compete because I'm scared.

224
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,500
Those people don't believe in me,

225
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,200
they think I can't do it so I have to prove to them that I can.

226
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,100
I agree with Manager Ma.

227
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,200
Old Xu.

228
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Yubing, I heard from Xiao Yu that you haven't been in the best condition lately.

229
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,190
Wait. Didn't the doctor say you were fine?

230
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,000
If you have health problems, it is even more reason for you to not play.

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,900
The most important thing for you right now is to go get a checkup,

232
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,200
not to act brave on the field.

233
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,800
Considering the scores we have right now,

234
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,500
we are very likely to win the final championship if we win this one.

235
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,600
The entire team has been working so hard for so long.

236
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,000
Big Jiang and Old Deng will graduate next year. They will retire then.

237
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
This might be their last chance to win the championship.

238
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,000
It's for XDragons and all the senior players,

239
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,700
and for myself.

240
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,600
As the captain, I cannot leave in a crucial time like this.

241
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,400
I promise.

242
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,500
I will get a health examination after this game.

243
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,650
Manager Ma, you wanted to see me?

244
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,290
Xiao Liao, you came at just the right time.

245
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,810
Tell us about his health condition.

246
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,120
- He...
- We just want to hear your opinion.

247
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,770
- I…
- You are just an intern as the team doctor assistant.

248
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,670
Don't speak carelessly about things that you're not sure of.

249
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,820
He…

250
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,010
He might just have a headache.

251
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I think it might be because he hasn't been resting well.

252
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,500
Ice God is right. I'm just an intern as the team doctor assistant.

253
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,200
I might be wrong.

254
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,890
I've told you I'm fine.

255
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,500
All right. Health examination right after the game.

256
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,370
Definitely. I'm going to practice now.

257
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,930
Manager Ma.

258
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,100
- I'm going if that's all.
- Hang on.

259
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,780
Doctor Lin's mother is in hospital.

260
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,360
She will be on leave for two weeks. You'll take over for her while she's gone.

261
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,260
Me?

262
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,190
By myself?

263
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,300
Are you joking, Manager Ma? By myself...

264
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,370
Who's joking with you? Doctor Lin said you've done a good job these days.

265
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,530
In addition, other than Doctor Lin, you're the most knowledgeable about those matters in the infirmary.

266
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,670
If not you, then who else?

267
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,180
Doing a good job is one thing,

268
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,240
but I'm still just an intern.

269
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,610
I don't have much experience. What if there's an emergency during the competition?

270
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,550
Can you be optimistic?

271
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,670
And just now, didn't you say Li Yubing was fine?

272
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,280
If he turns out not to be fine, you will have to give me a good explanation.

273
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,380
I told you I might be wrong.

274
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,300
I don't care.

275
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,840
Mom, I want to discuss something with you.

276
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,710
Coach Jin is not running for Best Coach because of me.

277
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,500
But he used to win the title every year.

278
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,850
Without his help, I wouldn't be where I am now.

279
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,540
So I want to do something for him.

280
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,280
What do you want to do, then?

281
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,890
Mom, can you help me

282
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,400
find the ice skate blades from my first win?

283
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,910
I want to give them to him.

284
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,990
Those are your favorite. Are you sure?

285
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,110
The blades might be cold with me here.

286
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,010
But it is definitely warm with him.

287
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,840
Okay.

288
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,700
I will look for them in a moment.

289
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,450
Do you want some food?

290
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,500
Huan-huan,

291
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,910
tomorrow is the last game of Li Yubin's tournament.

292
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,110
- The team doctor isn't here. I have to be in charge.
- Congratulations.

293
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,320
My great doctor is finally going solo.

294
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,600
No, I'm worried I might mess up.

295
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,130
How would you mess up?

296
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,330
Do you remember that time when you saved the person at White Pagoda Temple?

297
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,650
- So heroic.
- No.

298
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,990
It's not the same. I only save one person at that time.

299
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,690
It is a team of many people now.

300
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,060
If there's a big accident, I'm on my own…

301
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,270
I'm really worried that I won't handle it.

302
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,900
Aren't you taking care of a whole team here every day? You're doing such a great job.

303
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,730
Don't worry. I believe in you.

304
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,740
Do you believe in him, too?

305
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,880
Little kitty,

306
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,140
I envy you.

307
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,360
I have to treat its chronic gingivitis later.

308
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,040
I'm combing it to make it relax.

309
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,530
I'm stressed, too.

310
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,660
Help me relax, too.

311
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,050
- Do you want me to comb your hair?
- Give it to me.

312
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,490
Don't be stressed. It will be okay.

313
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,420
Excuse me, can I sit here?

314
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,960
Let me help you wipe it.

315
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,700
Let me wipe it.

316
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,410
Let me blow it for you.

317
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,390
Where are you going? Do you need any help?

318
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,330
