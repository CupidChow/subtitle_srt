[Episode 24]

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,150
I'm quite curious...

19
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,300
How did you, Zhang Yuewei, and Big Jiang become such good friends?

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,380
We all have something in common.

21
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,040
We're all directionally challenged.

22
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,130
At the start of freshman year, we were at the team-building activity like today.

23
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,370
The three of us were assigned to a group to look for firewood.

24
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,710
And then we got lost in the forest.

25
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,840
We kept walking, further and further. We spent all night trying to get out of the forest.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,950
We kept going deeper into the forest. The funniest part is that

27
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,580
each of us thought someone else knew the way.

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,230
After walking all night, we were starving.

29
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,080
Only Big Jiang had brought one piece of bread.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,410
We all wanted to let someone else eat it, so in the end, no one ate it.

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,160
We thought since Yuewei was a girl,

32
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,520
but she was actually thinking of us men.

33
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,540
We barely knew each other,

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,650
but we were all willing to give way for someone else.

35
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,250
You guys aren't just directionally challenged, you're also all very compassionate.

36
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,750
It sounds like it turned out well in the end.

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,000
Since then, we've become like this.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,370
The closest of friends. I always think about

39
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,190
how sometimes, the trust between people

40
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,760
might just happen after something as small as that.

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,600
Whenever I run into issues, I'm not afraid.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,510
Because I know that no matter what,

43
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,750
they will always be standing behind me.

44
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,010
I completely understand.

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,880
It's like Huan-huan and Zhenyu.

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,640
I know that no matter what, they will always support me.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,820
I think that if I were to be separated from them one day, it would be worse than a breakup.

48
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,980
You say that so easily, but have you ever had a breakup?

49

Try it. I dare you.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,570
- Why do you like me?
- I'm blind.

52

- What do you mean?
- But I don't want to cure it.

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,330
- Yuewei, she—
- What's wrong?

54
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,270
- She's missing.
- Missing?

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,280
- Don't panic yet.
- How can I not panic?

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,230
Yuewei is directionally challenged, you know that. She's like a dummy once she's in the forest.

57
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,560
She's strong, and she's our Brother Wei,

58

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,290
If you also had someone you liked

157
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,240
and you knew they liked someone else,

158
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,090
would you still fight for them?

159

It's like a lottery ticket.

Why scratch off the rest?

163

So you're just going to give up like this?

164
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,740
I don't want to lose him as a friend, too.

165
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,720
Right now, I can at least see him every day,

166
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,140
and he can talk to me without restraint.

167

We can still have fun and encourage each other when we encounter troubles.

I think it's pretty great, really.

169

Even though he isn't my boyfriend,

170
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,230
at least he's still a friend.

171
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,170
So you're saying... If you told him, you two wouldn't even be able to stay as friends?

172
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,140
What do you think? So you mustn't tell Li Yubing!

173
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,440
You two are my best friends. I don't want our friendship to end like this.

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,650
would it no longer be possible for us to be friends?

Okay.

181
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,900
Students, I think the first interview topic for this month

182
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,340
can be about someone from school recently involved in anything big.

183
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,300
Do you have any suggestions?

184
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,930
Ice God, Li Yubing!

185
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,890
The school paper is practically becoming his. Let's pick someone else.

186
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,490
Figure Skating Champion, Yu Yan.

187
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,530
He's a pretty fresh figure.

188
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,820
We've only interviewed him once since he came to this school.

189
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,180
But I think Yu Yan is receiving special training outside of the country.

190
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,050
He's going to participate in an international figure skating invitational soon.

191
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,880
His chances of placing first are very high.

192
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,780
But I‘ve always heard that Yu Yan likes to keep a low profile.

193
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,420
Aside from that singing competition, he never makes any public appearances.

194
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,950
Club President, I can convince Yu Yan.

Our center's equipment room has lost two valuable pieces of training equipment.

204
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,220
Logically, an outsider wouldn't know too much about the equipment.

205

I keep thinking back and forth, and I think this was done by one of our people.

How did you get out?

I almost got caught as a thief. Luckily, Brother Wei saved me.

How did she save you?

320

She lied to Manager Ma and Coach Chu saying

321

that she wanted to meet me to get closure. She said she doesn't like me and wants me to give up.

That works? Manager Ma and they believed it?

Of course. Brother Wei's acting was so good.

I feel like she's been looking at me strangely these days.

00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,120
this isn't real.

471
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm Qiu-qiu. I'm still waiting for you.

472
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,510
Ice God. Ice God. I'd like to ask you a question.

473
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,570
Why did you reveal your girlfriend? Is it a counterattack against Yu Yan's interview?

474
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,950
Audience, I have a strong premonition.

475
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,490
A fierce, icy love triangle is about to begin!

476
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,750
[XDragons Li Yubing]
[Tang Xue is my girlfriend!]

477
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,380
Li Yubing, are you crazy?

478
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,020
I asked you to update your Weibo, not to reveal your love life!

479
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,580
[Are you sure you want to delete this post?]

480
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:52,320
Bing-bing, I know now. There is no limit to the power of love.

481
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,410
If he feels threatened, he will explode.

482
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,030
This power will shake the world.

483
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,490
Bing-bing, the whole world knows now.

484
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,890
Good luck to you.

485
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,380
Good luck!

486
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,570
Hello?

487
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,160
Yubing? I'm at Manager Ma's. Come here.

488
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,740
Okay.

489
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,930
Bing-bing, liking someone is not illegal.

490
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,080
My little ancestor!

491
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,650
I'm sorry. I just...

492
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,740
My hand slipped.

493
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,760
Impressive, Li Yubing.

494
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,490
You change pretty fast.

495
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,430
A couple of days ago, it was Zhang Yuewei. Today, it's Tang Xue?

496
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,300
Not only did you ignore what I said about no dating,

497
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,920
you went above and beyond.

498
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,310
I knew about it.

499
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,670
You knew? You're quite generous.

500
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,680
- You two, tell me the truth.
- The truth is that

501
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,750
there is nothing between me and Zhang Yuewei. Tang Xue and I are dating.

502
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,110
Coach Chu, even though I am dating, I am not letting that affect my training.

503
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,470
You can see my abilities.

504
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,630
Performance is only one side of the issue.

505
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,390
Tang Xue, Li Yubing's dating rumors are already everywhere.

506
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,220
His reputation will definitely be affected.

507
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,320
The Olympic City Cup's ribbon-cutting ceremony

508
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,550
was an opportunity to thoroughly promote the club,

509
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,900
yet at this point, you decided to create this mess.

510
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,510
My little ancestor, are you trying to drive me crazy?

511
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,030
I'll admit. Everything is my fault.

512
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,040
Back then, I shouldn't have let Tang Xue enter the team.

513
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,540
With her performance, she wasn't supposed to be in the team anyway.

514
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,670
If Tang Xue wasn't in the team, would you two have had the chance to develop your relationship to this point?

515
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,850
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

516
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,150
Manager Ma, it's true that Tang Xue was able to enter the team because of me,

517
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,730
but she was able to stay with her own efforts.

518
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,670
I approved of letting Tang Xue staying in the team. She definitely has the ability.

519
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,480
Coach Xu, say something.

520
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,850
Li Yubing, I need to say something about this. What you did was wrong.

521
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,810
Did you tell me when you started dating?

522
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,880
You need to tell me so that I can be happy for you.

523
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,250
You're right. It was my fault.

524
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,520
You've got a good eye, just like me.

525
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,430
Coach Xu!

526
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,180
Manager Ma, they're athletes, but they're also college students.

527
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,950
They need a life. Am I right?

528
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,960
Coach Chu, are you hearing what he's saying?

529
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,830
Dating can definitely affect one's performance.

530
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,780
That's right!

531
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,400
But it seems to have no effect on you two.

532
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,900
Okay. It seems you two are here to undermine me today.

533
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,020
Manager Ma, I am a hockey player.

534
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,480
I should connect to hockey games, not love.

535
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,850
I won't let other things let me give up dating, but I promise you

536
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:22,300
I won't let dating affect my training and my competition standings.

537
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,390
Coach Chu, even though I am dating, this will not affect my training.

538
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,330
I'm working hard to stay in the team

539
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,750
because I truly like speeding skating.

540
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,170
I promise you, I will show you even better grades

541
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,650
to prove myself to you.

542
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,150
There's another ancestor now.

543
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,800
♫ This moment when my heart beats as in my dream,
only you can understand ♫

544
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,190
♫ Your eyes like stars are twinkling in my night sky ♫

550
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,030
♫ I want to accompany you for every sunrise
and take you traveling ♫

551
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,030

my heart fell for you, it must be destiny ♫

556
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,920

the rainbow to pluck a star ♫

557
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,560
♫ Secretly listening to your feelings
and let the stars fulfill each of your dreams ♫

558
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,950
♫ I want to collect every expression of yours, they are the four seasons that belong to me ♫

559
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:57,080
♫ This moment has a scent like honey,
it is the signal you are giving me ♫

564
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,160
♫ it is the signal you are giving me ♫
