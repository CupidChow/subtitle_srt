3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,759
Ai.

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm cold.

5
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,759
So let's find something to cure the cold?

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,479
No way!

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,440
Well, you told me that this month we have to be ourselves.

8
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,680
Now I am.

9
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,280
Nhai.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,320
I want to...

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,160
No, I don't want. Who are you?

12
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,640
spit out my friend.

13
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,680
My friend is not pervert like this.

14
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,400
Ai.

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
I said no.

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm going to sleep.

17
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you mad?

18
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,200
You're acting stupid.

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,800
Have you ever heard of the Gray Devil?

20
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,520
Daddy Teach you through a duck keychain, right?

21
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,480
I was taught through the tale of the gray devil.

22
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,760
The story is like this,

23
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,360
everyone has a gray demon inside.

24
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,280
It is hidden in the human mind.

25
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,000
It rely on anger

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,840
and people's frustration.

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,720
You will say that

28
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm the devil

29
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
because I'm mad at you?

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,520
No.

31
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm just going to say

32
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,280
the more the devil eats them,

33
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
it grows bigger.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,880
It will take hold of us.

35
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
If someone is swallowed by a gray demon,

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
that person can't love anyone again.

37
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,120
I was once a gray monster.

38
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,200
What do you mean?

39
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,640
You don't love anyone?

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,240
I have but not in the way I want.

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
I love my family,

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Grandpa,

43
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,159

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
But, those love

47
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,200
it's not a knight.

48
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,560
I have to endure it

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,880
over many years.

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
Now

51
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,280
have you found a knight yet?

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,960
May be,

53
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
the knight in form of duck.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,280
My duck keychain?

55
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,720
Maybe.

56
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
Since I met Mr. Ducky,

57
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
the devil inside me

58
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
didn't dare to come out to rage again.

59
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,560
You might not be the devil in the first place.

60
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm sleepy.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,640
Yeah.

62
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,159
Sleep.

63
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,480
Good night.

64
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Knight.

65
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,880
Nhai change your sleep position, I couldn't breathe.

66
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,320
Umm.

67
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,720
Hm.

68
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,880
What’re you doing?

69
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,880
Why?

70
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Why look at my face like that?

71
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
Did you think that I tries to make love to you?

72
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,440
You are the one who tries to make love to me.

73
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
Last night you hugged me and tried to kiss me.

74
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,360
Also sleep on my body.

75
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,480
I thought you are side pillow.

76
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
Then here's the thing.

77
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
Or it must be Morning Kiss first.

78
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,960
Hmm.

79
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Stop.

80
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Stop it.

81
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,560
What time is it?

82
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
11 A.M.

83
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,480
Go to take a shower.

84
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,080
Then I'll take you to eat.

85
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,880
Next, collect your things at your place.

86
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,960
OK.

87
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,880
What?

88
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,159
Sit properly.

89
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,960
I don't want to say hi to your private part.

90
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,039
Go away.

91
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Why you are so violence,

92
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
but i like it.

93
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,040
You keep teasing me.

94
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,280
Can you take me to Singh's bar? I left my motorcycle there.

95
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,480
Singh..

96
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,360
Is he the person who was with you yesterday?

97
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Who is he?

98
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Singh is a brother next door.

99
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,080
I known him since I was a child.

100
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,960
I has something to discuss.

101
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,280
And then, he's just playing.

102
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
Did you know

103
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,360
that I am jealous?

104
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
None of my business.

105
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm going to take a shower.

106
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
Shy?

107
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,760
Huh, hungry.

108
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,920
Why did you yell?

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,600
Hungry! I am so hungry!

110
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,720
Don't you want me to take a shower with you?

111
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
If you tease me one more time,

112
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
I will break your model.

113
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,480
Please, Sir, Mr. Chen Nhai.

114
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Why my heart beating so hard.

115
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,680
Maybe because I'm running. Yeah because it's definitely running..

116
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Oh.

117
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,960
No, it's not.

118
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I can't be shaken.

119
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
You fell in love with my housewife mode?

120
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,760
Hey.

121
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,880
Such a bad manner man. Why don't you knock the door?

122
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,000
What? You are the one that doesn't close the door.

123
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,280
What, I think you're not careful.

124
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,640
Running to close the door, your towels might fall.

125
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Well I will not going give you what you want.

126
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
No!

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,960
Ai, where are you?

128
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
can I use your lotion?

129
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Just choose and use any lotion that you want.

130
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,320
Oh.

131
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,400
It's extraordinary.

132
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,400
I thought it is a lotion shop.

133
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,720
I know now

134
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
why he is so handsome.

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,440
Did he use lotion for shower instead of water?

136
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,040
Which one should I use?

137
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,040
Use the most right side.

138
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,120
I used it frequently.

139
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Hey!

140
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,680
I was shock. When did you come in?

141
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
In the way since you said I am handsome.

142
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,080
Why are you here? Collect anything?

143
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
I am here to wash clothes.

144
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Here it is.

145
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,680
Aww.

146
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
You didn't wash it yourself?

147
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,440
I see there's a washing machine.

148
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
Depending on my mood.

149
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,160
If in a hurry mode, I will wash myself.

150
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
But your cloths and your pant,

151
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
I wash with my own hands.

152
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
Thank you very much.

153
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
Change from saying thank you

154
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,000
into accepting my love instead.

155
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,200
If you be my wife,

156
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,840
i will say yes now.

157
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,880
No way.

158
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,720
Why?

159
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
You doesn't want to be with me,

160
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
my wife.

161
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
What's wrong with you

162
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,920
You're wife.

163
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,200
Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife.

164
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,520
Is that it?

165
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,040
Ai.

166
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,080
Aiyaret.

167
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
I’m hungry.

168
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,720
Can I eat it?

169
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,840
You're so noisy.

170
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,000
You can eat it.

171
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
I bought for you.

172
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,720
Microwave is here.

173
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,080
Use the bowl

174
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,320
and make it heat.

175
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,720
It's cold,

176
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,160
but still delicious.

177
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,840
Why?

178
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,200
You never did?

179
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,920
Why don't you put it in a bowl, warm it up, sit down and eat?

180
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,160
Um..it's...

181
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm lazy to clean the dishes.

182
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,160
I’ll do it.

183
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
If my father see me do like this.

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,280
he will scold me.

185
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,040
Actually.

186
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
My dad doesn't let me do it.

187
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,800
But here, Daddy is absent.

188
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,600
I did it.

189
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,160
Stubborn.

190
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,320
Um you’re the first one.

191
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,040
That says I’m stubborn.

192
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,160
But my dad

193
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,280
said I'm a good boy,

194
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
rarely to be naughty.

195
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,680
- Because
- Because you are too lazy to cry.

196
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
I am about to recall my childhood memories and ruined it.

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,640
Tell me about your childhood,

198
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,480
but we have to keep walking and you can tell me about your childhood during the way

199
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,520
I will take the cloth and send it to the laundry.

200
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,440
OK.

201
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,520
Here's the thing

202
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,680
My family has 3 members

203
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,120
my dad,

204
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
me,

205
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,720
my brother.

206
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,520
My mom

207
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,160
passed away.

208
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,720
when I was 6-years-old,

209
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,640
My dad run a chicken rice restaurant.

210
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,640
Our restaurant is successful.

211
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,840
So good that

212
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
he get lots of profit and no time to take care of me.

213
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
My dad

214
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,320
left me with Singh's mother,

215
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,640
the person who live next door

216
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I can say that

217
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,680
she treated me so well.

218
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,400
Awwww

219
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
What's the drama then?

220
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,760
When I was a kid,

221
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,560
I am so naughty.

222
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
I was crying

223
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,400
so loud

224
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
When Singh heard it,

225
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,200
he teased me

226
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,480
by put red lipstick on his lip

227
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
and threatened me

228
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,680
If I didn't stop crying,

229
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,080
he would kiss me.

230
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,200
Did you see that his face look like a gangster,

231
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,680
It's haunted to me.

232
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,200
I was very scared.

233
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,120
So I’m

234
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,840
still haunted me until today

235
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
I have the main rule that

236
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,280
if anyone is going to be Chen Nhai's love,

237
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,160
can't have red lips.

238
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,040
I will never ever use red lipstick anyway.

239
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,920
Become my lover

240
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,560
and I will make you comfortable.

241
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,640
Yes

242
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,640
Talking about kiss,

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,440
can we kiss in the car?

244
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,240
there's a pourish spill all over your face.

245
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,440
This restaurant?

246
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,360
I'm not hungry yet.

247
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,440
Is this restaurant?

248
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,160
What's the matter ?

249
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,200
Isn't it delicious?

250
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,680
I told you I want to have an easy meal just lunch box.

251
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,560
Why don't you let me...

252
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,640
Why are you want the lunch box?

253
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,320
No nutrients.

254
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,600
Well, it's easy for me

255
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,240
Put it in the microwave and you're done.

256
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,280
Open mouth.

257
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Eat it so you can stop complaining.

258
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,840
Eat a lot so you can grow up quickly.

259
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,440
What?

260
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,160
Full?

261
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,320
Excuse me.

262
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,480
Excuse me.

263
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,280
Can you pack for me?

264
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,800
Okay, wait a minute.

265
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,480
Better to listen to music

266
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,440
Turn on now.

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,720
Yeah.

268
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
That's my favourite song.

269
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
I don't usually listen to it.

270
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,760
Oh.

271
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,040
Aren't you listening?

272
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,560
This song is good

273
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,560
♫ You know ♫

274
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,280
♫ that secretly loving someone ♫

275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,120
♫ How tortured it is ♫

276
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,040
Isn't it good?

277
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,240
I don't know.

278
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,120
Ingfa, are you sure the Ai will come here?

279
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,520
I usually come here with Wine.

280
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,360
But those 3 people are busy so it must be you and Bambi who have to help me.

281
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,680
Oh Jida, I'm more than sure.

282
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,600
If they don't come, you can throw shit to Bambi's face.

283
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,120
Oh, why is it me, you must be hit.

284
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,320
Well, I want jida to throw at you. Why?

285
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,880
Sigh, I'm begging you.

286
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
Wow!

287
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,040
I miss this battle field.

288
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,480
Ai's gang is already here

289
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
Oh Bambi

290
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,200
can you blend with your friends in the group?

291
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,680
Sigh, you make me uncomfortable.

292
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,520
Let's listen together. what did they say

293
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,080
Attack.

294
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,360
It's not fun at all.

295
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,360
It's like I'm playing with only Nine

296
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,960
It's true what you said.

297
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
Oh, what about me?

298
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,760
I challenge you to play basketball with me.

299
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,240
I give you 1 vs 4 players.

300
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,040
you are going to lost anyway.

301
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah, talk about Ai.

302
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,560
Recently, Ai and Nhai go everywhere together.

303
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,480
Did you notice?

304
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Well, since Nhai  heartbroken,

305
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,840
they stick together all the time.

306
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,640
I wonder Ai might become Nhai lover.

307
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Shit.

308
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,840
What are you talking about?

309
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,400
What's wrong with you?

310
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,680
I guess.

311
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,880
It's not like that.

312
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,800
Nhai likes girls

313
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,800
As, probably...

314
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,280
That's enough.

315
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
You can stop guessing.

316
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,560
if they really like each other.

317
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,320
I think it

318
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,240
normal.

319
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
It's true what you said.

320
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,440
I said, Ai and Nhai

321
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
they are match,

322
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
or are they already in relationship?

323
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
None sense.

324
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,720
keep playing.

325
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,880
Hello

326
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,400
Here I come.

327
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,880
What are you doing?

328
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
Oh, Ton

329
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,600
hello

330
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,560
Nine and Intha coming too?

331
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,640
Hello.

332
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,360
Can you swears that you don't know?

333
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,160
Uh....

334
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,680
Ai and Nhai didn't come?

335
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
Did you see them?

336
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,960
Oh, Nine are so fierce.

337
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,680
Be kind to us.

338
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
We are here in peace.

339
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,400
Yeah.

340
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
But where did Ai and Nhai go?

341
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,600
I don't know.

342
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,560
They are lovers

343
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,000
where they are going

344
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
are no longer your concern.

345
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,200
Well, Ton said at the beginning that they are not in relationship.

346
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,560
Oh.

347
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Are you here for sneaking us ?

348
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,520
No! we are not sneaking anything.

349
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,040
Even in this modern world,

350
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,200
when you lie

351
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
are they still using the highs pitch voice?

352
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
Don't you know?

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,920
That it's not smooth at all.

354
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,560
No! we are not sneaking anything

355
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,520
Oh, Enough is enough.

356
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
So jida and friends are you here for playing games?

357
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,800
Yes.

358
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,120
Yes.

359
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,760
So that's fine.

360
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
The game we are playing need team member.

361
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,840
That's good.

362
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,440
And usually jida and her friends What game are you playing here?

363
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,320
Or

364
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,320
play these games that we are playing?

365
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,800
Yeah.

366
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Let's go in first.

367
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Uhh.

368
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, we'll go back.

369
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
Yeah, you're hungry right?

370
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,000
Well, yes.

371
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,240
So let's go.

372
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,800
Bye bye.

373
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

374
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,840
Let's play together again.

375
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,360
well

376
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,960
Jida and friend are being weird.

377
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,320
Why?

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Well it's normal.

379
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,320
Let's play a game.

380
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,400
You are so naive.

381
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,440
Hey,

382
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,640
I just remembered that I was going to ask several times.

383
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,560
The day you brought me the porridge,

384
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,560
how do you know my room?

385
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
I keep tracking.

386
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,200
Well, asking from a friend.

387
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:58,880
Yeah

388
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,560
Then that day I lost the way,

389
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,960
you come and pick me up me right place again.

390
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
Also going to Singh's bar.

391
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
How did you find me all the time?

392
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,960
I

393
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,280
ask from your friends.

394
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,560
But I didn't tell anyone where I was going.

395
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
Let's load the GPS together, shall we?

396
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,280
What is it?

397
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,080
Well, the map.

398
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,920
Intha

399
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,000
tell me

400
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
that you often lost the way.

401
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,680
If we have this application,

402
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,840
when you drive away

403
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,240
I can pick you up, right?

404
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,600
Good.

405
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Take it, take it

406
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,160
Load it now

407
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,200
You really don't remember anything?

408
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,280
You only care what you are.

409
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
I guess.

410
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,680
You and I must be soulmates.

411
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
so I followed you right?

412
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
We are

413
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
the true soulmate.

414
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,720
don't be nervous.

415
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
I don't believe in soulmate.

416
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:00,880
Oh yeah?

417
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,720
But Ton told me

418
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,600
that you are waiting for a clip of a gypsy card

419
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
every week.

420
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,920
Well,

421
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,360
Just watching when I got nothing to do.

422
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,480
Let's go.

423
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,760
Better to get into the room.

424
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I won't finish packing.

425
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,280
Let's go.

426
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,080
My sleeping place.

427
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,800
Shocked?

428
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,440
If you can't stand it

429
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
you can change your mind and we can go back to be friend.

430
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,200
We are still on the point that can return

431
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,760
No.

432
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,560
You wait and see.

433
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,880
I will make you

434
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,120
become falling in love with my habits.

435
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,000
Aw.

436
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,640
What is this?

437
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,080
Why are the tissue papers

438
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,440
stuffing them in your socks?

439
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,120
Hey!

440
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Nothing.

441
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
do you often stay in your room?

442
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,080
I live here alone

443
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,520
It's a little cluttered.

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,960
It's normal.

445
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,640
I don't think so.

446
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,240
Well.

447
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,360
You wait here.

448
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll go get my clothes.

449
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,480
in a moment

450
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,760
I got a very good skill in packing thing.

451
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,720
Where do you go out for sleep?

452
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Where?

453
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,840
Well,

454
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,960
many places.

455
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,360
Ton's room.

456
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,760
Intha's room.

457
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,280
Sometimes I got bored,

458
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,240
I ride my motorcycle to other provinces

459
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,400
and then find a hotel.

460
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,680
Do you like hanging out alone?

461
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,120
Nope.

462
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,840
I don't have anyone to go with.

463
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,120
Next time,

464
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,480
you should ask me.

465
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,720
Well,

466
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,520
did you just mentioned we are soulmate?

467
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,560
Well, you just

468
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,720
have to find me where I was by yourself.

469
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,920
I'll go get my stuff.

470
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,360
Wait a minute.

471
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,920
Nhai.

472
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,400
Come here.

473
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,840
Which one do you choose?

474
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,960
I'll do it.

475
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,680
It's okay.

476
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,840
I can do it myself.

477
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Here we go.

478
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,600
I'll fold it for you.

479
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,640
You make like this

480
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,080
The clothes are completely wrinkled.

481
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,000
Wrinkled clothes?

482
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
It's Chen Nhai's style.

483
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,480
People already know my style.

484
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,680
I confess with honestly,

485
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm very organized person.

486
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,240
when I saw you in your crumpled clothes.

487
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,640
I always want to take it off and iron it.

488
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,320
Actually,

489
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,160
I

490
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't lmow how to iron my clothes.

491
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,760
Then you should stop losing the way while riding

492
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
and instead keeping your petrol

493
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,800
and just hire someone to iron.

494
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,800
Oops.

495
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,080
It's so hurts.

496
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,880
It hurts to the point of my heart.

497
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,000
You are over acting.

498
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
I like the way you keep organize , Ai

499
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,800
because

500
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
it's something I don't have.

501
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
just now

502
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,520
you just told me

503
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,120
that you like me.

504
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,600
I said I like the way you are organize person.

505
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,040
That's it.

506
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,480
You said you like me.

507
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,480
You quit bothering me.

508
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,640
Otherwise I will...

509
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,080
Nhai,

510
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,840
you

511
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,320
like me.

512
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,440
Stop doing it.

513
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,640
Your eyes will tell

514
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,280
that you like me.

515
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,200
Like a friend,

516
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,760
not a lover.

517
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,120
I think you

518
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,760
like me more than that.

519
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,320
You are...

520
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,640
Hey!

521
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,080
What's wrong with you?

522
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,600
You also want to...

523
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,200
Are you mad at me?

524
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,600
Well,

525
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,120
I don't know how to apologize.

526
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,640
Nope.

527
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,160
I'm not mad.

528
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,960
Or you

529
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,800
I...

530
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,720
I didn't hate you just now.

531
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,960
I feel good too.

532
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,560
But all of sudden

533
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,840
I thought I was a man.

534
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,560
Being together with a man

535
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,280
my body

536
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,840
against myself.

537
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,720
It's okay.

538
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
I need some time.

539
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,440
If I like you more

540
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,360
or really love you,

541
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,160
there's no problem.

542
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,880
But

543
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,440
if we don't get along,

544
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,440
I.don't want to continue the relationship until we can't look at each other.

545
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,240
I can wait.

546
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,720
Ai

547
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm

548
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
Sorry for kicking you.

549
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,760
Come here.

550
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,720
I'll help you.

551
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,960
Hey

552
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,560
No.

553
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,000
W,ell

554
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,680
I meditated in a moment and it disappeared.

555
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,200
So you're going to let go of my mood like this?

556
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,440
So...

557
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,440
turn around

558
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
you and I have to masturbate.

559
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Close your eyes.

560
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,960
Well, I think...

561
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,880
Chen Nhai

562
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,440
I told you to close your eyes.

563
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,560
Stop thinking.

564
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,800
Alright?

565
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,400
You are really spoiled.

566
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,920
Aww.

567
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,159
Ai.

568
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,639
Are you sucking my neck?

569
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,639
I'm not sure.

570
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,920
So you look.

571
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,920
Hmm...

572
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,639
Seems to have bruise.

573
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,760
Thank you.

574
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,239
It's okay.

575
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,239
I am sarcastic.

576
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:52,840
Oh.

577
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,800
I thought you really thanked me.

578
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,240
Ton.

579
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,640
What's the matter?

580
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,160
I've seen you go and eat for a long time.

581
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,280
Did you get dumped by a girl?

582
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,120
People like me.

583
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,120
would get dumped?

584
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,320
What's wrong with you then?

585
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,400
Nothing.

586
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,840
I was just wondering

587
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,760
if Nhai really like Ai?

588
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,000
Ton

589
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,440
why are you stressed?

590
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,000
He's afraid of being left alone by this guy.

591
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,800
Not at all.

592
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,320
Hey Intha,

593
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,120
do you remember this?

594
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,720
The story that Nhai told you.

595
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,080
About his first girlfriend

596
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,840
back in high school.

597
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,080
Yes,

598
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,640
it's his first girlfriend.

599
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,040
As soon as he has a girlfriend,

600
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,200
he left Ton alone.

601
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,320
Nhai and his girlfriend went to the cinema together.

602
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,200
That's enough.

603
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,000
and you also cried at that time

604
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
that he refuses to go to the movies with you.

605
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,920
At last,

606
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,320
Nhai comes after you and

607
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,760
went to watch the  movie over and over again.

608
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,280
That time, I was so young.

609
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,480
Now,

610
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,960
I can watch alone.

611
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,760
Don't be fooled.

612
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,000
Yes.

613
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,640
And you?

614
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,600
stop teasing me

615
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,840
otherwise I will exposed your secret.

616
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,720
What are you talking about me?

617
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Oh.

618
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,280
Intha, the hot person.

619
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,760
Always get mysterious gifts.

620
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,560
But I don't know who.

621
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,360
Why do you want to know?

622
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,560
you are too stupid

623
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,800
you never know.

624
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,640
Wow!

625
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,160
But it's true.

626
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Aww.

627
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,680
Nine

628
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,080
I thought you are my team?

629
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,120
Have you heard that

630
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,600
there are no true friends

631
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
and permanent enemies.

632
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,760
Hey, look at that.

633
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,360
Is there anything I can help?

634
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,800
Oh! Ghost.

635
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,600
By the way,

636
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,080
Is there anything I can help you with?

637
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,560
Oh no, nothing.

638
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,280
Oh.

639
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,080
Aren't you go back home?

640
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,440
Well, Ingfah forgot something.

641
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,360
Forgot something?

642
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:32,960
Forgot what?

643
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,200
Forget anything around here.

644
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,400
We'll help you find it.

645
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,840
Hmm

646
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,960
I found it.

647
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,200
Oh, this is an auspicious bracelet.

648
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,360
I've been looking for a long time here.

649
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,000
Since I found it,

650
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll go back guys.

651
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,000
This time we will go back,

652
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,920
actually go back.

653
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,840
It seems like

654
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,720
we're going to meet them many times.

655
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,080
Well, we look cool, right?

656
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,040
It's normal if people will like us.

657
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Let's go back to the table to eat snacks.

658
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:04,920
Alright.

659
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,080
Ai,

660
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,360
wake up.

661
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,480
I have to go get the motorcycle at P' Singh's bar.

662
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,360
Okay, okay.

663
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,960
Don't be lazy now.

664
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
You take a look at the love mark.

665
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,600
Is it gone yet?

666
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,800
How does the love mark dissapear in a few hours?

667
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Because of you.

668
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,400
What should we do?

669
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,640
Come help me figure it out.

670
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,800
Ai,

671
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,480
wake up.

672
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,560
Wake up quickly now.

673
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,200
Ai,

674
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,160
I wake up now.

675
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,920
I woke up, okay, okay.

676
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,720
OK?

677
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,760
Hey.

678
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,160
It's even more red, Ai.

679
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,600
Do you have a high collar shirt?

680
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,960
Will you wear high collar shirt?

681
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,120
Are you crazy?

682
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
wear like that, Singh would knows that.

683
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,960
Know what?

684
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,120
know you and I

685
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,880
Why?

686
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
You and me?

687
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,560
If it doesn't help you shut up.

688
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,760
You've been shy a lot lately.

689
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
Not about shy.

690
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,480
About the mark,

691
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm sorry about that.

692
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,960
It'smy feeling.

693
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,760
Alright.

694
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,280
That's it.

695
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,000
Stop doing that pervert face.

696
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,920
You take off your shirt like this.

697
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
How can you not let me look at you?

698
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,040
I'm going to dress up in the weirdest outfit of my life.

699
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,680
Until

700
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,960
You don't dare walk with me.

701
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,800
Let's do it.

702
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,760
Go ahead.

703
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,240
No matter how weird you are,

704
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
I like you anyway.

705
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
I'll like you more.

706
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
More and more everyday.

707
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,680
So,

708
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,800
I won't change.

709
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,080
I'll go like this.
