3
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,380
How is Chao Nan's house?

4
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,700
Awesome.

5
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,580
The food is delicious. Did you eat well?

6
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,420
- So full.
- Because you ate too much.

7
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,979
Sib, you want me to feed the chickens now?

8
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,700
Yes. He will fatten up if he eats this time of day.

9
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,420
Let Nhai go with you. Look like he needs some exercise after that meal.

10
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,500
Could you go feed the chicken with me, Nhai?

11
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,780
Of course, I can.

12
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,420
It’s really fat.

13
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,500
Yes, Sib fed him so much that he couldn't fight with other chickens.

14
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,460
So we just raise them for fun.

15
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,420
Can I touch him?

16
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,980
Be careful. They might peck you.

17
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,420
It’s weird, normally he won’t be scared of people.

18
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,060
My family sells chicken rice,

19
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,420
maybe they might want to avenge me for their friends.

20
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,420
Is that so? If you open a restaurant, it means you are good at cooking, right?

21
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,420
Not at all, I only cut the cucumber and serve the dish.

22
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,900
But I’m not starving to death for sure, I can fry the egg and make the instant noodle.

23
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,780
I can’t cook either,

24
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,579
maybe more than you, because my egg is burnt.

25
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,980
And I don’t eat instant noodle.

26
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,060
Yes.

27
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,700
In my teens, I was always selfish and hot-tempered.

28
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,380
Now, I’m already old when I see an energetic youngster like you.

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,860
I regret that I didn’t enjoy my teenage for the fullest.

30
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,220
I’m jealous of you, Nhai.

31
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,660
There's nothing to be jealous of, I always got bullied because I am a pushover.

32
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,340
But I heard you said something awesome to Rajin, Ai's mother.

33
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,420
Don’t worry. I just have someone watching her.

34
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,700
I want to stop her for once but I can’t do it.

35
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,860
It will hurt Ai too much.

36
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,579
Rajin followed Ai to Canada before the day that he got expelled.

37
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,260
Normally, Ai is not that hot-tempered.

38
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,620
I was angry at Ai, he didn’t tell me about Rajin visiting him.

39
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,340
I want to know what they are talking about, but I'm afraid to ask.

40
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,220
He was not telling you because he was afraid that you'd be angry.

41
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,700
He respects and cares about your feeling. And about Ai’s mom

42
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,700
she went to Canada because she wanted him to marry. And about the secret,

43
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
I think he’s not going to reveal something bad about himself.

44
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,980
Is that so? Nhai, you know Ai’s secret, right?

45
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,540
I know a few but if you tell me it’s a secret,

46
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,900
I can make sure that Ai won’t be hearing this from me.

47
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,460
Nhai, do you think I’m mean? I separated him from his mom.

48
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,500
If you were mean, I'd be meaner.

49
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,220
She commanded me to break up with him.

50
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,020
And I told her that I won’t.

51
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,060
And I will be an obstacle between him and his mom.

52
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,180
That means we can work together.

53
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,420
I’m in the same team as you from the beginning.

54
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,980
You are a smart person. You know how to make people relaxed.

55
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,700
Ai always said that I am good at survival.

56
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,100
You guys look close.

57
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,820
When I saw Ai smiling, It relieved me.

58
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,580
Please take care of Ai.

59
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,620
Please take care of me too, JaoNan.

60
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,220
Don’t worry about Rajin making Ai marry.

61
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,940
Because after Ai graduates, I'm going to meet your father.

62
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,060
In the meantime, please ask him about the dowry fee.

63
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,980
Please offer, no matter what amount I can afford.

64
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,860
He's kind as you said.

65
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,700
What’s wrong with you?

66
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,940
Nothing.

67
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,620
I can sleep with Ton and friends.

68
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,220
Your face doesn't look friendly now.

69
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,700
No.

70
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,340
Huh? Why are you angry at me? I didn't do anything for you?

71
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,980
The room is small. I usually sleep alone.

72
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,420
It's not small, I just have a lot of stuff. You have two guitars.

73
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,900
What is that? Something like a violin

74
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,580
Yes, It's a violin and in the box is a keyboard.

75
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,220
Why don't you study music if you like music this much?

76
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,620
I want to be a pilot. Music is just a hobby when I have time.

77
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,980
What is your favorite musical instrument?

78
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,460
I like Thai fiddle. The one I played for you that day was a Thai fiddle.

79
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,900
I rarely see you play Thai instrument

80
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,620
I often see you playing guitar and piano.

81
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,100
Something is reserved for someone special, only special people.

82
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,180
If I'm special then stop being angry.

83
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm not good at asking someone to reconcile.

84
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,860
Jaonan belongs to my father.

85
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,140
Huh?

86
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,380
But you...

87
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,580
are mine.

88
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,580
Are you angry because you are jealous?

89
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,060
No, but you make a cheerful face and only look at Jaonan.

90
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,860
You don't even look at me.

91
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm asking you, what were you guys talking about?

92
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,060
Jaonan seems to like you

93
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
and you also said that Jaonan was kind.

94
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,740
Even though you were really scared of him.

95
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,220
About general matters and your mother.

96
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,580
He is afraid that your mother will cause trouble for you.

97
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,780
But...

98
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,660
I never told him about my mother.

99
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,700
I told him. I forgot that you used to say they were incompatible.

100
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,300
Jaonan asked me if there was anything I didn't like about you.

101
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,300
I told him and said I don't like your mother.

102
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,460
What did he say about my mother?

103
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,340
He said he didn't like her either.

104
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,140
Anyway, what do you dislike about me?

105
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,900
Querulous, talk a lot, have a short memory, get lost often, eat too slowly, eat a lot, slow,

106
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,140
too proud, toss during sleep, and always steal the blankets of those who sleep next to you.

107
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,260
It's you! Are you kidding?

108
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,100
Yes, I'm all joking.

109
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,580
You're going to have a problem.

110
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,820
Have you lost your anger? You can't be angry at me for long, Ai.

111
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,100
I cast black magic on you. Your body is mine.

112
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,300
Your heart is mine. Infatuated with my body and infatuated only with me.

113
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,140
Just do it now.

114
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,740
Stop.

115
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I'm going to take a shower.

116
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,980
You take a long shower.

117
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,240
My body was greasy and smelly.

118
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,880
I'll take a shower and hug you with my sweet body.

119
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,460
Alright, okay.

120
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,900
Hey!

121
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,060
Let's take a shower together, for speed.

122
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,780
No.

123
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,180
Yes, please.

124
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,020
Ai, my shirt is wet.

125
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,180
Just take it off.

126
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,780
Nhai.

127
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,660
I'll turn off the lights, so we can sleep.

128
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,540
Okay.

129
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,780
Ai, I'm hungry. I can't sleep. Let's go get something to eat.

130
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,300
Jaonan told me that make myself at home.

131
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:54,900
Well. If Jaonan says so. You can eat everything, even the pillars of the house.

132
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,260
I'm a human, not a termite.

133
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,260
No, you are a duck. Look. When you're angry, your mouth is like a duck.

134
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,460
How long will you be talking nonsense? I am hungry.

135
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,420
Get up then.

136
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,900
Follow me.

137
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,220
Just choose the food you want. There's a lot in the refrigerator.

138
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,660
What about croissant? It's Jaonan's. It's delicious.

139
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,620
I’ll take it then.

140
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,600
Can this one too?

141
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,980
Sure.

142
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,060
Ai, please give me some milk.

143
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,260
I don't have a hand to hold it.

144
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,900
Please pick it up.

145
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,220
It's so fragrant.

146
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,780
Croissant?

147
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,700
It's handmade from my house. We use good quality butter.

148
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,860
When it is heated, it will be especially fragrant.

149
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,780
If you like it, you must come to my house often.

150
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,140
I like to eat it but I don't mean the smell of croissants.

151
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,460
It’s a smell from the wind. Its smell seems like flowers.

152
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,580
Maybe the tree nymph comes to welcome you.

153
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,020
You knew that I am afraid of ghosts!

154
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,220
It doesn’t exist, I just kidding.

155
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,100
I guess it’s a smell of frangipani right there.

156
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:05,180
Frangipani is over there but navigator is over here.

157
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,980
I’m also annoyed seeing a couple show affection while I’m heartbroken.

158
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,060
Are you still awake?

159
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,140
I don’t feel sleepy, so I just go out for a walk and breathe some cool breeze.

160
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Actually, no one hasn’t slept yet. They are watching a movie in the living room.

161
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,580
I think I will join them. Where have you guys been to?

162
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,420
Just take Nhai to grab something to eat. I was about to sleep but he was hungry.

163
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,340
You’re such a cow!

164
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,830
And you're such a buffalo.

165
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,100
Are you really close friends?

166
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,100
Of course! Ton is uglier than me.

167
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,940
I won’t be friends with those who look better than me!

168
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,460
I am leaving. I’m so annoyed with people who are full of themselves!

169
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,580
Go away! I’m annoyed either.

170
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,500
Then why are you looking at me?

171
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,300
Something's on your face?

172
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,500
Nope

173
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,060
I just wanna ask am I looking better or uglier than you?

174
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,100
You're better looking than mine.

175
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,300
This is accepted.

176
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,980
So why are you friends with me?

177
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,140
Or you didn’t accept me as a friend in the first place?

178
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,380
What the heck are you talking about

179
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,940
Just tell me that you fell in love with me since you first met me.

180
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,540
You’re full yourself! I like you in the way of friendship!

181
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,460
I’ve never thought of you more than that. It’s only you who think in that way!

182
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,740
And what do you think about now?

183
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,380
What kind of friend cuddles every night?

184
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,780
Move.

185
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:20,099
Hey! Babe, can you move aside? I’m gonna find some good places to eat my snacks.

186
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,220
Pretty please! Move! I’m tired.

187
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,860
Please, my love. Are you okay with my answer?

188
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,340
Oh! Ton. Where have you been?

189
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,180
I just went outside for a walk and breath some breeze.

190
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,060
I see.

191
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,740
Where are you going?

192
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,580
I saw you been out for a long time so I just worried about you.

193
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,900
I’m afraid you would sad alone.

194
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,260
I don't want you to stress.

195
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,900
I’m better now. Don’t worry.

196
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,940
Let’s go watch a movie!

197
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,820
Nai, look.

198
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,940
Ton, where have you been?

199
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,940
None of your business!

200
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,180
You jerk.

201
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,790
Ton!

202
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,940
I bet your friend is in love.

203
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,380
Who is that?

204
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Let’s find out!

205
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,900
Get over it! You can’t win over me.

206
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,340
If you know that. Please don’t make me feel loved often!

207
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
What are you watching?

208
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,970
What do you want to watch?

209
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,380
I want to watch the documentary.

210
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,580
Find it yourself.

211
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,900
You walked so slow.

212
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,900
Here it is.

213
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,460
Let's watch this.

214
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,100
- No.
- I want to see a giraffe.

215
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,260
Come on.

216
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,350
We’re all together.

217
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,580
Here!

218
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,800
Please distribute it.

219
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
What did you all write?

220
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,260
I want to take a look.

221
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,340
Please.

222
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,020
No! Go take a look at Intha's stuff.

223
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,540
Intha?

224
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,980
Think for yourself.

225
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,980
Ton. What about you?

226
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,140
Go away, Nhai! Don’t copy me.

227
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,380
What is it?

228
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,500
This one is for writing future goals.

229
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,900
We'll write it down and put it in a cylinder wherever we go.

230
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,620
Just write it, I'll keep them and return them to you when we graduate.

231
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,300
Is it like to see how far we succeed?

232
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,660
Just like that.

233
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,660
Good idea

234
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,180
It’s hurt, Nhai.

235
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,380
Let me borrow your back, I don't have a table.

236
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,100
I am everything to you.

237
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,700
Do I need to complete this sentence?

238
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,380
Up to you.

239
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,660
What will you write?

240
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
I'm not telling you. It's a secret.

241
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,420
[I wish to eat croissants at Ai's place again']

242
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Let's break up, Nhai.

243
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,320
Why?

244
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
I'm bored of you.

245
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,080
I wonder why I've had feelings for someone like you for so long

246
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,680
You don't clean your room, you don't wash and iron, you play games and sleep each day.

247
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,800
You've said that you're okay with me

248
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,840
I was infatuated with you back then. Now I'm bored of you. I'm bored!

249
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,040
Can't we forget about breaking up? Don't leave me. Please, Ai.

250
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,600
I do not dispute you. I will improve myself. I surrender everything to you.

251
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
Don't break up with me.

252
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,880
It would be impossible. I told Nene that I would break up with you and date her.

253
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,560
Nene is better than you in everything. She is beautiful, fragile,

254
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,950
good at playing instruments, gets along well with me, she can take care of me, she is different from you.

255
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,320
You can't just leave and forget me like this.

256
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,160
Let me go.

257
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,080
And who will I be with?

258
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,600
It's up to you.

259
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,600
Ai, wake up.

260
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,560
Don’t bother me while I'm sleeping

261
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,440
So I'll take a shower first.

262
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,040
I will post a picture of today.

263
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,120
What's her name?

264
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,600
Nene. Why?

265
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,680
Do you like her?

266
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,000
She is cute. I just realized that she plays piano.

267
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,760
And you, go to sleep now.

268
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,760
Ai. Me and Nene, who is cuter?

269
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,680
Nene…

270
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,920
You are bad!

271
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,880
But she really is cuter than me. Darn, it hurts!

272
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,820
Hey! There they are.

273
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,880
You guys took a very long time to get here.

274
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,600
And what about Chon?

275
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,560
He's not waking up. I woke him up several times.

276
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,440
What did you do to him?

277
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,240
I wouldn't be that jerk.

278
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,320
Maybe he was playing game with me 'til late at night.

279
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,320
Alright, let’s eat. We can let him sleep.

280
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,840
Me and Jaonan will go for a walk outside together after the meal.

281
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,260
Let's eat.

282
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,960
Are you okay, Nhai?

283
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,840
I'm okay.

284
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,200
What do you like to eat? I'll grab it for you.

285
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,160
Nhai.

286
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
What’s wrong with you?

287
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,740
You can't compliment someone who's cuter than me.

288
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,940
When do I admire someone?

289
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,840
I have never done that. Don't malign me.

290
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,680
You said it this morning!

291
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,760
I didn't say it.

292
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,200
This morning when I asked who was cuter between me and Nene and you answered Nene.

293
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,680
You're a bad boyfriend.

294
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,040
How do you compliment others?

295
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,040
I can’t remember it.

296
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,960
Do you realize that you broke up with me to date Nene?

297
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,080
Did I?

298
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,160
Where? When? What did I say?

299
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,320
Tell me.

300
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,440
In my dream.

301
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
Ouch! Why do you pinch me?

302
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,760
The ancients said that if you had a nightmare, you must be pinched, and it wouldn't come true.

303
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,920
You just want to pinch me.

304
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,840
Stop the tears.

305
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,120
Who told you to mix dreams with reality?

306
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,200
And blame me.

307
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,480
You're this cute, who would dare leave you?

308
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
You pinched me!

309
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,480
Don't expect me to forgive you.

310
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,840
You can get mad at me but let me kiss you.

311
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,480
If I have acne, I will be angrier.

312
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
It's so scary.

313
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,080
You're bad. You're teasing me.

314
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,120
If you're mad, let's fight here.

315
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,300
Come at me.

316
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,360
I'm not fighting anyone.

317
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,240
Yeah.

318
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,600
Chon, wake up.

319
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,960
How long will you sleep? We're all going out now.

320
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,000
I have diarrhea, Ton.

321
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,720
Really?

322
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,520
How?

323
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,800
I must have eaten too much.

324
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,000
Nan's cooking was too delicious.

325
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,240
So can you hike up the mountain?

326
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,800
I don't know.

327
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,360
So get some sleep. I'll make you an ORS drink.

328
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,320
We can do the hiking later.

329
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,280
Is this an outdoor walking tour in your meaning, Dad?

330
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,560
Just ask Jaonan. It's his idea.

331
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,600
I just want Nhai to experience the daily life of the people here.

332
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
In case you live here in the future.

333
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,720
Why are you smiling? People will think you are crazy!!

334
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,760
Ai and Nhai are the same, right? Jao? When they are embarrassed, they always yell.

335
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,760
Me and Sib will be looking for a coffee shop. Feel free to look around in the market.

336
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,680
Okay, Jaonan.

337
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
Like father, like son.

338
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,680
What is it?

339
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Just look. Ai and Sib are exactly the same.

340
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,270
Right.

341
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,040
It's true. Even his wife is similar.

342
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,280
Yes, he really looks like Nhai.

343
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,480
I hope they will love each other for a long time like Sib and Jaonan.

344
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,760
Ai was very fond of Nhai. They don't break up easily.

345
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm only worried that Nhai will break up. He always gets mood swings.

346
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,220
You buy a lot of food.

347
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,100
Hey! Stop!

348
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,340
Can't I get some?

349
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,720
Did you buy that much?

350
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,000
We will be camping at the mountain.

351
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,360
So we talked about buying snacks that we wanted to eat.

352
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,360
Get moving, then. Drive carefully.

353
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,880
Okay, Jao.

354
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,920
I’ll be back, Jao.

355
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,120
Thank you for the accommodation and delicious food.

356
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,120
Thank you.

357
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,060
- Good bye.
- Bye.

358
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,860
You drive, Nai. I don't want to.

359
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,140
Put them down.

360
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm so stiff.

361
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,920
You have to practice Tai Chi Qi Gong 18 moves so that you don't get tired.

362
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,280
Tai What?

363
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,440
It's Tai Chi.

364
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,840
It's good. I used to practice with my dad.

365
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,680
You won't feel pain in your body and your skin will be healthy.

366
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,120
Your face and mind will be refreshed.

367
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,920
You don't need Tai Chi. Exercising with you will help me refresh too.

368
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,440
It makes my skin healthy, my face clear and my mind refreshed.

369
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,600
If it falls to the ground, you won't have a pillow.

370
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,560
Hold it carefully, Hub. Remember that one pillow for two people to sleep together.

371
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,900
Okay.

372
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,520
Are you guys ready? So we can go to the tent.

373
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
We have been ready for a long time. We are waiting for the two of you who are arguing.

374
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,780
Is that arguing?

375
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,100
I'm sorry, your Chon can't come together.

376
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,460
He's not mine.

377
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,300
How he's got diarrhea?

378
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,440
I don't know, everyone has eaten the same thing.

379
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,320
But he only got diarrhea.

380
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,920
But we should thank JaoNan who's taking care of him.

381
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,880
Or I probably wouldn't have come.

382
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,580
I would be worried about him.

383
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,960
Come on. Chon has someone taking care of him.

384
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,240
Now I can travel to the fullest. Don't worry.

385
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,200
Okay.

386
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,660
Let's go.

387
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,100
- Keep walking.
- Go.

388
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
What are you doing? Make a tent.

389
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,360
Oh, I can't breathe for a while?

390
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Ton.

391
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,640
You can sleep alone?

392
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,080
Sure.

393
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
I usually sleep alone.

394
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,200
Chon doesn't come, you don't have a choice.

395
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,920
I want that yellow one.

396
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,270
No! Let's unpack the red one first.

397
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,510
Yellow!

398
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,510
Unpacking two bags of snacks is killing you?

399
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,070
It's not killing me but it would be too much. We will not be able to eat dinner.

400
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,100
- I want the red one.
- No.

401
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,620
Nhai.

402
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,620
I want the red one.

403
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,940
- Red one.
- No.

404
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,340
I want it!

405
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,460
Nhai.

406
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,100
I said I want the red one.

407
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,520
This position is not good, Nhai.

408
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,040
You have made a mistake.

409
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,760
What do you mean? I've got my snacks now.

410
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,520
If you want the red one, eat it. I'm not stopping you.

411
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,639
Are you satisfied?

412
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,840
No. You know how to satisfy me.

413
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,880
It's scary. I have to escape.

414
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,440
I like this cold weather.

415
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,480
I envy Ai a lot. The atmosphere is very good.

416
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,420
Ton.

417
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,440
But your house is next to the sea. It's very good.

418
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,240
But it's freaking hot. It's not as cold as here.

419
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,380
Also you can see the stars clearly. See?

420
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,800
It's good to breathe fresh air like this after a while.

421
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,180
Yes, I always visit places like this

422
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,320
every time I come back to Nan.

423
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,120
I have rested and relaxed.

424
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,920
True, but it's not normal for us.

425
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,360
Yes. I'm not sure what makes you guys appreciate nature.

426
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,640
We usually drink alcohol and play cards.

427
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,540
Okay.

428
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,040
It's true. Let's go inside. Let's play a game.

429
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,800
Come on! I'll take all your money tonight.

430
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,840
But I have this new board game. Is anyone interested?

431
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,000
Me.

432
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,800
Me too.

433
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,840
Two.

434
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,360
Me too.

435
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,160
Three.

436
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,760
Gosh! Why?

437
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,870
Okay. I'll demonstrate how to play. You want to play with me, Nhai?

438
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,500
Sure.

439
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
Clean the table.

440
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,600
You don't understand it, Nai. You can't play a board game when you're camping.

441
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,600
You have to play cards.

442
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,840
Agree, Nhai?

443
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,320
Say it out loud that you're afraid to lose.

444
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,820
Bummer.

445
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,120
I’m sleepy.

446
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,440
After you lose, you go to bed.

447
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,240
You're just lucky, I didn't lose.

448
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,220
I want to go to sleep too. Get my guitar inside for me.

449
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,520
- See You.
- In!

450
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,720
You two want to keep playing with me?

451
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,320
Ai and I will leave now.

452
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,460
Okay.

453
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,940
Clean this up. will you?

454
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,100
- Yeah. Good night.
- See you.

455
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,600
Hi.

456
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,840
Just want to check if you're having fun.

457
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
I am. The weather is so good here.

458
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,400
And how are you?

459
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm better. Nan took me to see a doctor.

460
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,960
He paid everything for me even I didn't want to.

461
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,440
It's okay. I'll buy something to thank him.

462
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,120
Are you better now, Ton?

463
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,280
What do you mean?

464
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,360
After you broke up with Amp.

465
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,320
I feel a lot better.

466
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,360
Don't worry

467
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,080
It's good. I don't want you to be sad.

468
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,000
I must thank you for coming at the right time.

469
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,960
I have friends to talk to when I'm lonely.

470
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,200
I better go to sleep.

471
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,520
OK.

472
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,000
Good night.

473
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,040
You're in a good mood.

474
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,200
I haven't beaten Nai in a long time.

475
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,920
I'll treat you to a meal tomorrow, celebrate my victory over Nai.

476
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,080
Let's get some sleep, sir.

477
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,320
Okay. But you're that cold?

478
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,080
Yes, the ground is freaking cold.

479
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
I'm so cold.

480
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,240
Are you a polar bear? You can take off your shirt in this cold weather?

481
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,640
Just touch my body. And you'll know that I'm sweating.

482
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,720
Just sleep. Stop telling me to touch your body. Love your body.

483
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,640
I don't love my body because I love Nhai.

484
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,860
I feel nauseous.

485
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:39,940
