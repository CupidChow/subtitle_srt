4
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I don't understand

5
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,440
why you bought so many miniature.

6
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,400
It's a must have item.

7
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,400
You don't understand the heart of miniature fighter.

8
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
Did you get mystery gift again?

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,039
Yeah

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,520
I just saw it.

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,360
It's hidden in a board game bag.

12
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,039
I'm really curious

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,960
who gave it.

14
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,640
Yeah,

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,880
who gave.

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,080
Huh.

17
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Never mind. Just keep playing the game.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,000
Never mind?

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
You  always don't  know who give it.

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,960
Ton,

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,680
inside the bag

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,840
it's candy.

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,039
- Will you eat or not?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,280
Enough.

25

Let's keep playing.

26
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,400
Intha,

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,120
Think about it wisely.

28
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,040
If you made a mistake,

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,240
you can lose more.

30

Nine's miniature military base is undefended.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
You already lost.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,840
I choose to attack your military base,Ton.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,720
What?

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
Why did you hit my military base?

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,880
My military base is about to get destroy.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,400
Because if I hit Nine base,

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
I'm at a disadvantage for you.

38
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,560

to the public.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,960
Step aside.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Why?

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you afraid that

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm going to be more handsome than you?

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,160
Yeah.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,880
Are you afraid that we are more handsome?

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Alright,

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,520
you guys come close.

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040

"Who is most handsome?"

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,680
Move a bit to this way.

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,760
Now, you can see who is the winner.

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,720
Nine...

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
I think if only the two of us are in the frame, it would be better.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,760
I agree with you.

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,160
Give me a shot.

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,360
Stop.

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll go downstairs.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,320
Hey.

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,280
What's the matter?

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,280
Did you get infection...

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,880
What's infection?

66
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,440

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,079
Not yet.

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
Are you?

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,440
Not yet.

73
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,680
Why aren't you playing music today?

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,120
Normally, you must do.

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm sleepy.

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm going to sleep.

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
If it's on, I'm definitely asleep.

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Nhai.

79
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,960
Tell me about your childhood adventure.

80
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,320
But, I don't want to hear about you sneaking into the woman's restroom,

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
because you want to know how women pee.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,519
Ton told me hundred times

83
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,440
Huh.

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
I'm just a kid.

85
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,560
But if I can go back in time,

86
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm going to hit myself.

87
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,120
How unlucky am I

88
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
that I have to take the same class with my elementary school friend.

89
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Oh,

90
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,159
It's funny.

91
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,840
I believe it.

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,520
I saw you laughing

93
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,840
until I think that

94
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,360
are you going to die?

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,760
What about you,

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
no any adventure at all?

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,760
I've never seen you tell anyone about your childhood.

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,640
Umm,

99
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,360
not much.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Went to school to play with friends.

101
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,440
After school,

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,040
I came back to study music at home.

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,000
On holiday,

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,840
went on a trip.

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,440
Once finish the semester,

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
flew to Canada.

107
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
My father has a house

108
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,800
and the plane garage there.

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,120
That's it.

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,360
Oh,

111
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,520
your life is so smooth

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
comparing to me when I was 14-15 years old.

113
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll tell you.

114
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
I am so cool.

115
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,240
Risk of getting punish by my father every day.

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Actually, I'm at risk of getting hit with a wand.

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
But I'm in Canada,

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,280
away from father

119
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,560
so survived.

120
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,320
I remember that

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,080
you said

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,080
you have 2 fathers.

123
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,680
Where is your mom?

124
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I've never seen you mention it.

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,560
None.

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,720
My father said she was dead.

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,880
Uh.

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
I've never said this much

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
to anyone.

130
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,620
Enough.

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,620
I will stop now.

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,200
Aww.

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm waiting to take you to meet

134
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
to my father

135
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,520
and JaoNan

136
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,720
at once.

137
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
You're always into this.

138
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,440
Well, why don't you just fall in love with me?

139
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,720
My advantages are

140
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,680
handsome,

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,840
rich,

142
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
and does the housework too.

143
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,560
I think

144
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,520
you can't find anywhere.

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
You are so confident.

146
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,800
Let be my boyfriend.

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,240
You just do nothing.

148
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,760
Let's call me a hubby.

149
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,400
to let me be happy and that is enough.

150
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,720
Hubby,

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,080
what does that mean?

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,560
Like a husky dog?

153
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,680
Meaning husband.

154
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
How does it become husky?

155
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I think you're more like a husky.

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,200
And won't your father mind

157
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
that the only son

158
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,760
has a boyfriend?

159
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
My father already knows

160
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,520
that we are considering our relationship.

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,280
When I picked the duck,

162
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,920
my father wes there.

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,120
What?

164
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Did you

165
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
make love and get leave behind?

166
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,120
JaoNan,

167
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,680
Ai made love with that guy

168
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
and he left.

169
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Such a sigh furious teenager.

170
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,960
If he don't like you then back off, Ai.

171
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,680
Oh, don't back down my son.

172
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,000
Just make a foolish face and go taunt him.

173
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
He will start to like you

174
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,680
and softened his heart.

175
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
Just trap him

176
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,600
so that he can't go anywhere.

177
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
Just like what I did to JaoNan.

178
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,200
See.

179
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,320
JaoNan really don't go anywhere.

180
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,280
Dad.

181
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
Saying like this, aren't you afraid...

182
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,680
Oh.

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,240
Ugh.

184
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm kidding.

185
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Why did you teach Ai like that.

186
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,560
Wait!

187
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,159
When did I fall in love with you,

188
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,440
Mr. Aiyares?

189
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,280
Just say that we might fall in love.

190
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
Look what we are doing now.

191
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,720
It's clearly like we live together before marriage.

192
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,320
I'm with you

193
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
because I want you to know my bad habits.

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,520
If you can't take it,

195
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,920
you will stop to like me.

196
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,400
All of my ex

197
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,280
can't accept my habits at all.

198
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not your ex.

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,920
Listen to me

200
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,360
that you got dumped by a girl,

201
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
not because of your bad habits,

202
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
but most women

203
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,960
like someone who take care of them.

204
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,440
But you don't.

205
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,320
So...

206
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
You need a boyfriend who can take care of you

207
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,360
like me.

208
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,799
What theory is this?

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
What a narcissistic.

210
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
Stop putting your hand on my head.

211
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,799
I will use the shell to shut your mouth.

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,800
OMG.

213
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Where did you get it?

214
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
Shock?

215
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
My other odd habit is

216
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,560
when I am drunk

217
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
and eat something delicious,

218
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,920
I'll always bring it back to my room.

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Is this shell delicious?

220
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh.

221
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,160
This one.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,280
I...

223
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,520
I pick the wrong one.

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
I'll tell you.

225
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,600
If you want me to stop like you,

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
you must stop acting like this.

227
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,880
I like you more

228
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,080
every time you make me feel surprise.

229
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
So

230
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
I like you more now.

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,760
I'll go down and say hi to Singh for a moment.

232
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,400
You can wait for me in the car.

233
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,680
No.

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,120
I'll go with you.

235
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,440
I'm going to go down and stretch a bit.

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,520
Alright.

237
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,760
Be nice,

238
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,000
because this place

239
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,080
is where I belong to.

240
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
If you are too much jealous, I will punch you.

241
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,160
Alright.

242
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
I know.

243
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,640
There you are, my son.

244
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,680
Wait a minute.

245
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,200
You appear now, Chen Nhai.

246
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
Actually, I would sell your motorbike and

247
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
take the money to pay all male prostitute.

248
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,680
Many arking spaces are available to park, but you don't park.

249
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
Should I punish you?

250
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,600
Hey Singh,

251
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,120
if you sell it,

252
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,880
what am I going to ride?

253
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,840
That

254
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,040
is a gift that I got when I enter the University.

255
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,960
If he really mean to sell,

256
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,680
I can buy a new one for you.

257
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,960
Hello, sister Vievie.

258
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,840
Oh.

259
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,240
Why don't you let your husband, oop!

260
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
Your friend picked you up.

261
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,440
Hello, my handsome man.

262
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,480
Oops.

263
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,920
I didn't stay only one day. What have I missed?

264
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,320
Aren't you going to introduce your friends , Chen Nhai?

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
Come over here.

266
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,880
You better go straight over there with me.

267
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
Oh my god.

268
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,480
You are

269
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,560
so fast.

270
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,920
When

271
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,320
I greet the customers,

272
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,960
you are being lazy.

273
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,320
Tae.

274
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Yes, sir.

275
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,480
Give the mock-tail to them.

276
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,680
The sweet one

277
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
like my face.

278
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,680
Hmm, what?

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Like your face?

280
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,800
Your face is bitter.

281
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,920
I'll deduct your percentage,

282
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,200
and give to all men.

283
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Don't listen to it.

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
Just a dog and buffalo sound.

285
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,880
Better go with me over there.

286
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,640
Tonight

287
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
enjoy what you want to eat.

288
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,520
Thanks.

289
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,640
Nhai.

290
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,240
This is Ai.

291
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,760
He is tall

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,600
like model.

293
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,760
Handsome,

294
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,800
having rich Dad.

295
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,400
He came from Nan province,

296
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
growing up in Canada.

297
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,680
Currently.

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
come back to study in Thailand.

299
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,840
He expelled from the University over there

300
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,040
because of the quarrel.

301
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
We become friend,

302
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,520
because Ai

303
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,760
found the duck key chain that Dad wanted me to take care of.

304
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,120
Oh, Chen Nhai.

305
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,820
You tell so much details about him

306
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,060
I can almost be another Ai's wife.

307
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,880
Chen Nhai.

308
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,260
You have such a handsome 'Fuean.' (Thai slang)

309
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,680
Why don't you tell me.

310
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,480
What?

311
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,360
'Fuean'

312
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,600
what's that?

313
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
It's so hard to pronounce.

314
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
That word 'Fuean'

315
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,720
is friends plus boyfriend

316
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,240
Singh.

317
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Ai,

318
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,400
wait here.

319
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,880
I have something to talk with Singh.

320
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,360
I'll come back soon, Ai.

321
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,400
What is wrong with your eyes?

322
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
- Go quickly.
- Hurry up.

323
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,980
Don't do anything weird.

324
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,240
Beware of getting punched.

325
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,160
This is the warning from me.

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Come here!

327
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
Nhai!

328
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,360
Be gentle with me.

329
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm a soft person.

330
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,320
What's your friend plus boyfriend?

331
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Ahh.

332
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Didn't you accidentally sleep with your friend?

333
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
Your husband comes to my bar.

334
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,720
Everyone can guess what it is.

335
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
I haven't told who is husband or wife.

336
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,520
How do you know?

337
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,400
Whoa.

338
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm an expert.

339
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,720
Even I close my eyes I still know your status.

340
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
Your husband invaded my bar

341
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,360
you are still wearing

342
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
the same outfit.

343
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,560
Err.

344
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,840
I already take a bath.

345
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,280
I didn't mean a bath,

346
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,720
I mean you and Ai.

347
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
continue the relationship, right?

348
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,200
If you like Ai,

349
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,360
let's try.

350
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,760
Don't worry too much.

351
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
He said he likes me.

352
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,080
Yeah, right here.

353
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,360
Here.

354
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,400
Ahh.

355
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,080
What's next?

356
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
So I told him

357
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,800
to stay with me for a month.

358
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,440
If he can't stand with my habits,

359
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,520
the relation will be over soon.

360
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,160
Living before marriage.

361
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,160
Not like that.

362
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,460
We are just seeking each other.

363
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
But the mark on your neck

364
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,840
are not just because of seek.

365
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,760
Err.

366
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,960
If you like Ai,

367
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,560
just give a try.

368
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
No, I don't.

369
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,200
If you like him, say you like him.

370
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,440
Don't fool yourself.

371
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,840
I don't know yet

372
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,200
about how I feel right now.

373
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,280
I don't know what it is.

374
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,320
Like,

375
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,480
just feel good,

376
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,040
or like him.

377
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm confused myself bro.

378
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
I still can't answer myself about

379
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,320
what am I thinking right now.

380
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
You're thinking too much.

381
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,920
Listen,

382
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,980
it's not difficult to love someone.

383
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,340
Whatever gender you are, it can happen.

384
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,080
As they said

385
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,360
age

386
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
is just a number.

387
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,520
Sexual is

388
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,440
just text values.

389
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I fear of losing friend.

390
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
You know

391
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,800
when I love someone,

392
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
I give it a hundred.

393
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,960
I don't want to start over with anyone often.

394
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,480
Why are you thinking so much this time?

395
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,480
If you don't learn and

396
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,440
don't try,

397
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,680
will you find the right person for you?

398
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,280
Don't refuse your chances.

399
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Maybe

400
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,000
the one you reject

401
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,480
may be the right person for you.

402
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
Why is it so hard?

403
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,880
Just give it a try.

404
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
Take it as a life experience.

405
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,120
As you introduce him to me,

406
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,380
I give three approval.

407
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,320
No,

408
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
I give ten approval.

409
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,480
Approve, approve, approve, and approve.

410
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,400
Handsome Face.

411
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,360
His lower body is great.

412
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,640
I like it.

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,080
You are filthy.

414
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,080
Alright,

415
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,280
since that day

416
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,360
have you

417
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,440
and I

418
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,320
tried

419
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,920
to make love

420
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,440
again?

421
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,640
Do not lie.

422
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,760
Not yet.

423
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,819
Just almost.

424
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,119
Almost...How?

425
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,800
Embrace

426
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,240
and kiss.

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,400
Let's assume.

428
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,960
If there is another guy

429
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,240
that’s not Ai

430
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
do like this

431
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
to you,

432
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,839
how will you feel.

433
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,280
I feel disgusting.

434
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
OK, OK, OK.

435
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,400
One more thing.

436
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Does he take care of you well?

437
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,240
Good.

438
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I think it's more than good.

439
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,960
Superb.

440
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,640
What is his size?

441
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,620
The size is OK. Oh! What are you asking?

442
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
I'd better go back

443
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
Oops.

444
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,440
I want to say Oops until I lose my voice.

445
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,740
Let's go back.

446
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,120
Should we leave now?

447
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,160
Yeah.

448
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,680
It's going to be dangerous at late night.

449
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,860
Let's go back.

450
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,640
Wait a minute.

451
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,280
I haven't talked to Ai, the handsome young man.

452
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,000
- That's right, sister. I feel upset.
- Um.

453
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,080
It's okay.

454
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,640
See you next time.

455
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
Anyway,

456
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,260
take care of my handsome brother.

457
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
I'll take good care of him.

458
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
I promise with all of my life.

459
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,440
OMG! What's this?

460
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,520
You just like the imagine couple in the 'Comments before Bed' podcast.

461
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Fuzzy.

462
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,240
The new couple will always be like this.

463
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,720
Err.

464
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm leaving, bro.

465
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,240
Good bye.

466
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,720
Alright.

467
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Is there anything wrong?

468
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,360
Nothing.

469
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,680
I'm just walking too fast,

470
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
so my heart is beating fast.

471
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,600
I see.

472
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:12,880
OK.

473
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,640
Ride safely.

474
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,520
See you in the room,

475
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,760
Fuean.

476
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,680
Ai

477
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm not that!

478
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,360
- You
- You

479
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,960
you said first.

480
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll ask

481
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
do you want to watch the movie?

482
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:51,920
OK.

483
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:52,960
And you?

484
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,640
What will you ask me?

485
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,320
I'm hungry.

486
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,320
Little Ducky.

487
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,320
Come on.

488
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,280
What will you eat? Choose quickly.

489
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,900
- This one?
- No.

490
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
What about this?

491
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I think I don't like.

492
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,580
- What if this one?
- This looks delicious. Order this one.

493
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,320
Would you like pizza?

494
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,280
Yes.

495
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
When do you think it will show up?

496
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
Ah

497
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm shocked.

498
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
This is terrifying.

499
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,520
I already closed.

500
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,800
You said you can watch horror movie?

501
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,080
Who would have thought this was so scary?

502
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,520
Should we change to watch cartoons instead?

503
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
Are you still afraid of watching cartoons?

504
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,240
Hey.

505
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:51,880
Huh.

506
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,680
He slept.

507
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,240
Sleep properly.

508
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
I will watch cartoons.

509
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,120
Cartoon watches you,

510
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,640
you are not cartoon watcher.

511
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,360
Would you go properly by yourself,

512
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
or let me carry you?

513
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,280
That's it.

514
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
What's this?

515
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
He can't see something delicious.

516
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,000
He put all delicious things in his bag.

517
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,600
What a greedy duck.

518
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Ai!

519
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,240
Ai!

520
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,800
What?

521
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,880
Ai.

522
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,600
Wake up.

523
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,240
Is it morning already?

524
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,120
Not yet.

525
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,880
But I want to go bathroom.

526
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
Why don't you go then?

527
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,840
Can you go with me?

528
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,360
I'm afraid of ghosts.

529
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,120
What's wrong with you?

530
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,120
It's because of you.

531
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
You ask me to watch the ghost movie.

532
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,760
Such a scary one.

533
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,520
OK.

534
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
You can't go anywhere.

535
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,880
Alright.

536
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,360
If you're so scared,

537
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,080
let me go in with you.

538
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,840
No, wait here.

539
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,720
Is it done yet?

540
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,680
Nai.

541
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,160
Wake me up and leave me here,

542
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,880
sweetie pie.

543
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,840
Chen Nhai

544
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,120
Chen Nhai.

545
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,240
Hey

546
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,040
Ai!

547
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,720
Stop or I will kick you.

548
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,240
You're mean.

549
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
Did your business

550
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
then left me.

551
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,140
How am I going to sleep tonight?

552
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm sorry.

553
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,040
I don't think you'd be this scared.

554
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,900
Then you go to sleep first,

555
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,760
Wait for you to sleep then I will sleep.

556
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,240
Will you going to flirt with me?

557
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,600
I'm trying to keep an eye on you.

558
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,200
Or you..

559
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,400
want to be haunted by ghosts while you sleep.

560
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
Hey

561
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,040
Ai,

562
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,240
don't say this.

563
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm kidding.

564
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,460
I'm kidding.

565
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,840
You can sleep.

566
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,400
I'll wait until you sleep.

567
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,200
Oh my little ducky.

568
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,960
Don't talk at all.

569
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,540
We have already talked about what we are going to eat.

570
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,440
OK. Are we going to eat Steak?

571
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
No.

572
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,840
So, Hotpot?

573
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,320
I want to have Hotpot.

574
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
No.

575
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,560
My hair will be smelly.

576
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,160
Nhai, if you have a problem,

577
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,800
it's easy just don't eat.

578
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,000
Let's make a vote.

579
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,520
Grilled Shrimp Chao Phraya.

580
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,120
Hey.

581
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,680
This one is good.

582
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,880
I like it.

583
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,200
I like the riverside view.

584
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,880
I'll eat this.

585
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Guys,

586
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,320
I think Hotpot is easier to eat.

587
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
We can take a moment there then go back.

588
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,320
Great!

589
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,800
My dear friend.

590
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,120
Then, the vote is 2-2.

591
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,600
I guess

592
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,600
we lost before voting started?

593
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,000
Grilled Shrimp.

594
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
Yes!

595
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's go.

596
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
See you at the restaurant.

597
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,800
Nhai.

598
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,840
Chao Phraya Grilled Shrimp restaurants.

599
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,000
It's at Rama Eight Bridge, do you remember?

600
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,960
Rama Eight.

601
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,800
Ok?

602
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,200
Yeah, I know.

603
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,920
Where is he now?

604
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,280
That's what I thought. The nutty duck.

605
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,840
When will you stop getting lost

606
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,480
and come and fall in love with me?

607
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,480
Ton let’s ask in group chat.

608
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,560
I already sent a message.

609
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,160
No reply from both Ai and Nhai.

610
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,680
Where are they going?

611
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,520
They didn't come together.

612
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,680
Ai drive a car today.

613
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,800
You call him.

614
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,160
OK.

615
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:54,960
Yeah?

616
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,520
What's up?

617
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,760
Where are you?

618
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,560
I’m arrived.

619
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,880
I can't find any restaurant.

620
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,260
The Grilled Shrimp restaurants. You've passed the bridge, haven't you?

621
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Yes.

622
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,040
What is the bridge color?

623
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,440
Green.

624
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,480
I see.

625
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Chao Phraya Green.

626
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,240
You definitely went to the Buddha Bridge.

627
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,280
Isn't that right?

628
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,320
Chao Phraya River Bridge

629
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
Come on, I'm hungry.

630
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,880
Calm down.

631
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,120
I'll move for you.

632
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,880
Ah

633
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,720
That’s Ai's car.

634
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,600
You're so furious.

635
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,240
Ai.

636
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,640
They say I'm lost.

637
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,840
But now you're coming the same way as me.

638
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Show that.

639
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,560
Is this Ton mistakes?

640
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,840
Ton is just a mess.

641
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
Don't complain him.

642
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,960
Are you really lost?

643
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,500
Then my sub conscious bring me to find you.

644
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,720
We are soul mate.

645
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,440
You came to this content again.

646
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,280
You follow me to the restaurant,

647
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,800
before your hungry friend eats your head.

648
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
Oh, I forgot.

649
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,520
When they're hungry,

650
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,400
they are so scary.

651
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,719
You are the same.

652
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,800
But you don't drive off the road.

653
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,000
Where I drive, just follow me.

654
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Yeah, I know.

655
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,920
If you get lost again this time.

656
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll go back and let you pay the bill you in my room.

657
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,239
Then you just drive,

658
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,280
I will follow you

659
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,000
not out of sight.

660
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,679
When I said I will punish, you become good listener?

661
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,920
I want you to get lost.

662
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,920
Why?

663
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,320
Not lost the way, but lost in my heart.

664
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,920
Are you crazy, man?

665
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,960
Let's just order first.

666
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
If we are waiting for two of them,

667
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,160
Sunset until the new dawn, we still probably won't be able to eat.

668
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm really tired of them.

669
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,400
Please take an order.

670
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,600
I'm getting sick of this perfect ironing shirt.

671
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,880
I should be your husband, seriously.

672
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,680
Don't talk too much. Hurry up, take a shower, get dressed and come to eat.

673
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,160
You should be wife, Aiyaret.

674
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,800
Do housework

675
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,440
and cook.

676
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,080
Look like super maid.

677
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,080
Who decided

678
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,520
that these chores must be done by wife.

679
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,120
When we live together, we should help each other to do.

680
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,080
Nhai,

681
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,160
if you don't hurry to take a shower. We're going to be late.

682
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,720
Understand, Mr. Chen Nhai?

683
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,240
I don't like the ironing clothes.

684
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
Why are you iron for me?

685
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,600
You can just maul the shirt.

686
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
Maul?

687
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,040
Then, you will maul me again?

688
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,360
I'm not stupid.

689
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,760
Is your duck still not lost?

690
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,840
What?

691
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,440
Why are you cursing my Mr. Ducky like this?

692
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,720
I take good care of it.

693
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,320
You taking care?

694
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,560
I only see Ai picking ducks for you.

695
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,040
Me?

696
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,540
Drop my Mr. Ducky?

697
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,360
Not true!

698
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,520
That's not true.

699
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,800
I'll go and reserve a table at the canteen first.

700
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
You guys quickly follow me, OK?.

701
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,120
Alright.

702
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,000
See?

703
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm speechless.

704
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,000
He dropped it again.

705
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,040
Is this normal for him?

706
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,440
He is always like this.

707
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,220
Let's go or he will complain us again.

708
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,500
Let's go.
