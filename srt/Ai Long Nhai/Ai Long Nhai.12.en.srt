00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,759
Where are you going?

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,479
Why are you here? I'm shocked.

5
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,039
Are you going to the bathroom?

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,640
No, I'm looking for you. I didn't see you when I woke up.

7
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,440
Why? Do you miss me?

8
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,760
I don't. So what are you doing here?

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
I cannot sleep.

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Do you have anything to worry about? You can tell me.

11
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,440
Nothing. I'm comfortable with you all the time. I'm just hot.

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,079
I'm just finding reasons for something nonsense.

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,079
Hub.

14
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,000
If everything had a reason, we would go crazy.

15
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Oh! Would you like to walk together?

16

17
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
I cannot sleep.

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Up to you.

00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,820
Let's go.

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,160
What are you worried about?

21
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,160
Come on.

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,360
Please tell Chen Nhai. I'll help you figure out the reason.

23
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:28,079
I just looked at the sky and wondered why Kobori had to wait for Angsumalin at the Milky Way.

24
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,700
Well.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,120
It's Kobori's business.

26
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
You got on my nerve.

27
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Do you know Japan's Tanabata Festival? There's a legend about it.

28
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,380
[Japan's Tanabata Festival originated from China]

29
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,600
It's about Kobori's Milky Way.

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,040
And?

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,720
The legend of a weaver girl falls in love with a cowherd

32
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,520
who is punished by her father, so they meet once a year on Tanabata day.

33
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,520
It’s the day the Milky Way appears.

34
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,760
Who told you about it?

35
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,520
My dad. He told me about it when we went to Japan

36
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
Kobori is not greedy at all.

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
He only wanted to meet Angsumalin once a year.

38
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:39,400
Perhaps Kobori wished Angsumalin to live well without him.

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,440
It's complicated. I'm lazy to think about it.

40
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
I'm not surprised.

41
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,880
What time is it?

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,840
It's 5:15 AM.

43
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,410
I don't want to sleep anymore. Let's wait to see the sunrise.

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,080
Please share a blanket with me. I'm a little cold now.

45
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,480
I feel warm now.

46
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,840
It's romantic, right?

47
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,600
Me?

48
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,600
It's a little about you, besides that it's about ambiance.

49
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,840
I love you.

50
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,159
You say you love me without rhetoric again.

51
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,040
How should I tell you that I love you? Show it to me.

52
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,200
You have to kiss first.

53
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,640
I love you.

54
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
If I want to hear it again?

55
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Then kiss again.

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,960
If I want to hear it every day, I have to kiss you every day, right?

57
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,400
Why do you want to hear it every day?

58
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,200
Just say it on the Buddhist Sabbath day, or it's not sacred.

59
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,400
It only has four days a month. Isn't that too sparse?

60
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,680
I thought it would end nicely, but you ruined it.

61
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
Are you trying to argue with me?

62
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm not. It's you who is a maunder. Love is not a sacred object.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,920
It's messed up! It's gone, my romantic ambiance.

64
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,560
But my love is not gone easily, Nhai.

65
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Please kiss me just one more time, and I'll give you everything.

66
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,920
Nhai is so cool.

67
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
Yes, he is.

68
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
He is tall and has very long legs.

69
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,679
Are you tired?

70
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,120
Not tired.

71
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,400
Nhai, I bring you some water.

72
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,520
For me?

73
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,320
It was a thank you for teaching me fencing a few days ago.

74
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,120
Oh, thank you.

75
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,240
Are you going to eat, Nhai?

76
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll go when I finish up my belonging

77
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,360
I heard that there was a new restaurant opposite the university. Let's go toge…

78
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
You're very spoiled.

79
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,520
It's okay, let's eat and take a shower later.

80
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,520
Take a shower first.

81
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,160
Okay.

82
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
What about the bag and Mr. Duck?

83
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,040
It's placed there. If you didn't mention it, I'd probably forget about it.

84
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm giving this water back to you.

85
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
My boyfriend likes soda.

86
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,760
He doesn't like plain water. I bought it for him in the car.

87
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,400
I’m here.

88
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,690
Let's go.

89
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,640
I told you to come early.

90
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm hungry, Hub. My stomach growled.

91
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
I got it,

92
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
but you have to sit outside first.

93
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,840
Dry your hair too, or you'll get sick

94
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:28,480
No, it's lonely outside. I'll harass you in the kitchen.

95
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,160
Would you like to try cooking? I will teach you.

96
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,360
I can cook but it's just not tasty.

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
I'll teach you.

98
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,640
Start with Chinese Stew Powder,

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,480
and some spice.

100
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,080
There are cinnamon, galangal, star anise, coriander seeds and some cardamom.

101
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,400
Do I have to put them all?

102
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,000
No.

103
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,560
Put them orderly.

104
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,480
It's hard. I've given up.

105
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,310
I will teach you.

106
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,420
Hold it.

107
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
Yes, and then stir at first.

108
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
Stir.

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,880
Wait, why is your body hot like you have a fever?

110
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,680
You really have a fever. Let's go to the hospital after eating.

111
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,960
No. I'm okay.

112
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
My body is always hot after exercise.

113
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,040
Are you sure?

114
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,520
100%

115
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,080
Who's calling?

116
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,640
Hello, Pin.

117
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,360
Oh! I haven't seen it yet.

118
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,680
Have you sent me a picture already?

119
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,520
Have you eaten yet?

120
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,440
Hmm? Will you treat my meal? Maybe later.

121
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm about to eat.

122
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll hang up. Bye. Mauh.

123
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,750
Who?

124
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Why? Are you jealous?

125
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,240
Who is Pin?

126
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,520
Your voice was so tender.

127
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,420
She is a senior. She graduated for two years now.

128
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,460
We're going to make faculty T-shirts. So we need to vote for its color.

129
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,680
I didn't read the group messages, so she called me to ask.

130
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,720
Just choose the color you like.

131
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,600
And you? What color do you like?

132
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,560
Pink.

133
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,240
I've never seen you use pink stuff.

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,360
Why?

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,520
I like it.

136
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,640
It’s not necessary to use it.

137
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,480
Do you have a stuffy nose?

138
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,000
No, I smell something burning.

139
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,080
Darn, my eggs.

140
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,120
Do you want to drag him here? In and I will sit at this table.

141
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,960
You look at him until your eyes are out.

142
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,400
Nai goes too, you don't need to worry about him.

143
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm worried.

144
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,400
He's sick and doesn't go to the hospital.

145
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,120
His fever went up and down. Just now, he said he was dizzy and nauseous

146
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,560
I must have forced him to go to the hospital. Dengue is spreading.

147
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,160
Good. He too, he always pretended not to be sick.

148
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,880
Afraid of staying in the hospital.

149
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
He was afraid of doctors and needles.

150
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,520
It took him a long time to go. He shed about a liter of tears.

151
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,960
It might be nothing.

152
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,560
He may be nauseous because he is pregnant.

153
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
You tend to use difficult gestures.

154
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,680
Nonsense. Are you under my bed?

155
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,520
When we were hangout last week,

156
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,480
he whispered to me about all the gestures.

157
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,000
I thought why he didn't tell Ton about this

158
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,880
because you probably wanted it more than me.

159
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,560
Why?

160
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,480
Chon has feelings for Ton.

161
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,840
You should still watch Dharma videos and send daily greetings stickers.

162
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,000
You shouldn't care about everyday life.

163
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,600
Chon and I love each other. He loves me for many years.

164
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,280
He has no way of liking other people.

165
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,640
Come on. It’s funny.

166
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,320
Did Nai and Nhai buy fruit in the garden? They're gone too long.

167
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,480
He's hard to die. He's here.

168
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,240
What's wrong? Nai.

169
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:32,720
Nhai had a fever, nausea and his arm was spotty. I think he has dengue fever.

170
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,240
I want to tell you to take him to the hospital. He said he could get better on his own.

171
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,960
Have you been applying mosquito repellent when you go to your club?

172
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,480
Yes, but I forget about it sometime.

173
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,800
Let's go to the hospital now.

174
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,240
No, I'm not going there. I'm afraid of needles.

175
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,080
You have to go to the hospital or you won't get healed.

176
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,760
No, I'm afraid of needles. Ai, please. I won't go there.

177
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,120
No. Let's go.

178
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,480
Do you hate me?

179
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
It doesn't matter whether I love you or not.

180
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,040
Are you going voluntarily or do you have to have tears?

181
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,840
If you force me again, I will... I will...

182
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,440
Do whatever you want. Nai, help me drag him into the car.

183
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,130
Sure, I'll follow him to the hospital

184
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,820
No.

185
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,060
- Get up.
- No, I'm afraid.

186
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
- Come on.
- No.

187
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,620
- I'll carry your stuffs.
- Thanks.

188
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,620
- Let's go.
- No.

189
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,100
Come on.

190
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,160
If everything is fine, I'll go back first.

191
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,440
Well, thank you. Back home safely.

192
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,280
Nhai. Get well soon.

193
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,720
Shut up. I'm sulking at you.

194
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,480
It's not my business.

195
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
- See you.
- See you.

196
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,839
My arms are full of holes.

197
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,520
I want to go home. I'm angry with you, Ai. I'm angry with Nai too.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,840
It's okay. It took a few days.

199
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:40,000
What do you mean? The doctor will draw my blood tomorrow. You hate me. Why did you bring me to the hospital?

200
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,360
Your condition will worsen if you don't come to the hospital.

201
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,440
I hate needles. I felt bad when I saw it.

202
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm on your side.

203
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,000
You don't go to university? You are with me now.

204
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,160
I don't go there. I'll wait for your father to arrive and go back to get the clothes at the condo.

205
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,320
Your father will take care of you another day, and I will take care of you at night.

206
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,480
He was going to take care of you at night, but I'm worried that his back will hurt if he sleeps on the sofa. So I will take care of you.

207
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,040
How am I? Am I a good son-in-law?

208
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:32,560
Very good, but it would be better if you didn't let me sleep here alone because I'm afraid of ghosts.

209
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm not leaving you. I'll take care of you when you're sick. I'll take care of you until I'm old.

210
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,840
Just sleep, for now.

211
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,120
Promise me that you will never leave me.

212
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,880
Yes, I promise.

213
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
Hello, dad.

214
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,800
Oh, Nhai. I have to go outside of town tomorrow.

215
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,560
Oh? Who is with me? You can't leave me like this.

216
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,800
You're as big as a buffalo, can't you be alone?

217
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,320
I can, but not in a hospital.

218
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,400
Please tell the doctor that I want to leave the hospital right now.

219
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,040
I can be with Nhai tomorrow, dad.

220
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,240
It's okay. Just go to university. Nhai is okay, he's just always complaining.

221
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,960
I don't want to be alone, dad.

222
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,360
Please call my brother if he has free time.

223
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,640
Otherwise, ask Singh for me. I think he has time.

224
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,240
So I'll try asking your bother.

225
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,160
It's okay, dad. Tomorrow my father will come to visit Nhai from Nan.

226
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
I have free time all day.

227
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,280
I have to bother you. Will your father hurry back?

228
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,120
If you guys have time, I'd like to have a meal together.

229
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,640
I think he arrived in Bangkok late in the evening.

230
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,080
We have the same thought. My father also told me to ask if you were free and he wanted to see you.

231
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,400
Let's meet. If I go to Bangkok late, please tell him to wait for me.

232
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,380
- Sure.
- Okay.

233
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,320
If everything is fine, I'll go now. I'm tired of Nhai's face.

234
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm your son, Chen Sa.

235
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:18,680
You are my son, but you don't want to be with me because you mumble all day when Ai will arrive.

236
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,320
Ai has arrived. I have to go now.

237
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
Drive carefully, dad. If you're home, please tell me.

238
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,400
Sure. I'll tell you.

239
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,180
Ai.

240
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,360
Thank you for taking care of him.

241
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,320
My pleasure. Thank you as well for giving me the opportunity to take care of Nhai.

242
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,440
It's a small issue. Please take care of him for a long time.

243
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm off.

244
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,580
Okay, dad.

245
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,960
Sib and Jaonan will be here tomorrow?

246
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,560
Yes, I told them this morning that you have dengue.

247
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
I feel intimidated. They must have traveled a long distance.

248
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,040
What date did the doctor say I can leave the hospital?

249
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,960
I don't know. You're still low on platelets. You will need to observe the condition for another 2-3 days.

250
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,640
Have you eaten anything yet? I saw something in the refrigerator. Did you buy it?

251
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,200
I have eaten. The refrigerator is a snack I bought, but you can't eat it. Sorry.

252
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,800
It's okay. Hospital food is delicious too.

253
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,600
What the heck are you doing?

254
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,160
I'll change to my pajamas. You should hurry up and go to bed.

255
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:01,040
I know, but if I can't sleep I'll shout your name.

256
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,520
Sure.

257
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,960
If you're hungry late at night, tell me. I'll order your favorite fish porridge.

258
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,960
I'd like to take your blood sample.

259
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,640
It’s done

260
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm afraid of a broken needle in my arm, so I don't have the courage to move.

261
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,680
I don't know how to comfort you. Let's watch cartoons.

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,560
Yeah, please heal my heart.

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,040
He is definitely my father. He just asked for your room number via Line.

264
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,420
Hold on.

265
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,280
Hello.

266
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,740
Hi.

267
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,480
Jaonan saw the doll and thought it was cute, so he bought it for you.

268
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,080
And these are fruits for you.

269
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,040
Give it to me, dad. I'll put it down.

270
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,880
How are you?

271
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,080
I'm fine, but a little bored.

272
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,760
You think it's cute, Nhai?

273
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,320
It's so cute. I'll hug it every night, Jaonan.

274
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,160
I had a lot of blood drawn, Jao. Look here.

275
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:28,880
Jaonan isn't usually as cheerful, but he says he likes Nhai because he's fun to talk to.

276
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,360
Nhai, he likes Jaonan a lot too. He didn't stop talking about him.

277
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,480
Would you like to try oranges, Nhai? It was delicious. I picked it myself.

278
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,000
Sure, Jaonan.

279
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,390
Ai, please send me an orange.

280
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,020
Yes.

281
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,760
I can peel it myself.

282
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:05,120
Actually, if you soak it in warm water before peeling it, the white fibers will be very low.

283
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,320
Really?

284
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,240
Yes, me and Jaonan don't like the fiber of oranges. So my father figured out how to keep the fibers as low as possible.

285
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,920
Wow! It's from Sib. You take very good care of your family.

286
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,560
It's harder to be loved, being a family is harder too.

287
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,800
I determined that I would take the best care of my family.

288
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,960
I feel very warm in my heart. You're so romantic, Sib.

289
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:48,480
Do you see? Nhai confirmed that I am a romantic person.

290
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,720
Please accept that I can make you shy.

291
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,760
You talk too much. Be careful.

292
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:09,160
I'm leaving now. I'm exhausted after a long car ride. I will sleep at the condo.

293
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,360
This evening we have to have a meal with Nhai's father.

294
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,280
Let’s go, Sib. So that Nhai can rest.

295
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,560
Yes.

296
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,820
I'll leave him here. Make sure to hug him.

297
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,900
Sure.

298
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,100
Big version of Mr. Duck.

299
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,560
The sib is very romantic, isn't it?

300
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,160
What about me?

301
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,280
You are a caveman in the wrong era. Your romantic glands are dead. You are a two-thousand-year-old pester.

302
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,820
Nhai. I'll get you.

303
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,560
But I want you to pester me for a long time, Hubby.

304
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
We fight every day.

305
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,940
Come on.

306
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,340
Scoot over a little.

307
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,780
Scoot.

308
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,560
If you lay down like this, the nurse must scold us.

309
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:21,840
I'm not afraid. If I get scolded, but I can hug you, it's worth it.

310
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,040
You're crazy.

311
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:38,160
Nhai, twenty or thirty years from now, I'll hug you like this, I promise.

312
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,360
Yeah.

313
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Ai, wake up.

314
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,240
Uh…

315
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,100
It's heavy.

316
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,760
We have to go buy shoes today.

317
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,860
What about a morning kiss?

318
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,900
I did it so wake up now. I don't have any shoes to wear.

319
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,620
Let's buy some.

320
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:30,200
Do I have a boyfriend or a centipede? If the one on the shelf isn't a shoe, then what is it, babe?

321
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm bored with them. I want a new one, but you make a face like you don't want to take me there. I can go there myself.

322
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,680
Really?

323
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,600
No, you won't let me ride my motorcycle in the sun.

324
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,320
Yes, what do we have to do in the morning?

325
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,720
You have to do laundry and clean the floor. I'll wash the dishes and take the trash out.

326
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Okay, I'll take you there after it's done.

327
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,720
Change your pants, they are too short.

328
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,360
What do you mean? Anyone wear them like this.

329
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,320
Change it.

330
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,800
No, I have no way of changing. It suits me. I look good when I wear it.

331
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,560
You look too good. Just put it for me in the room.

332
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,240
I said I bought it too expensive.

333
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,880
If you don't change it, you don't have to go.

334
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Okay, fine. I'll change.

335
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,640
Hello. How may I help you?

336
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,440
Wait a minute.

337
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,480
I want these shoes, size 10.

338
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,360
Please wait for a moment.

339
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,280
Yes.

340
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,200
I'll look around in the store.

341
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,640
These are size 10. Please try it on first.

342
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,440
I take this one.

343
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
Yes. Please wait for a moment.

344
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,760
It's done? Why are you walking barefoot?

345
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,120
Will you marry me?

346
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:56,040
Yes. I'm so grateful, Aiyaret. You gave me a marriage proposal in a shoe store. I want to cry.

347
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,850
I have to live streaming right now.

348
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,800
There.

349
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,460
Excuse me, your shoes are ready. Please pay this way.

350
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,679
Thank you.

351
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,440
You guys are so cute. I hope you guys will love each other for a long time.

352
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
Why are you so shy? You didn't even pay for it.

353
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,520
It's about to end the day, so fast.

354
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,040
Happy times always pass quickly.

355
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,159
It might be.

356
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,420
I have something to confess.

357
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,420
What is it?

358
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,540
I bought a cheese tart when you went to the bathroom.

359
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,040
Let's share.

360
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,760
Why are you so kind today? But how many bites do you share with me?

361
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,160
One bites only.

362
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,680
You can eat it alone. To steal your snacks makes me feel sinful.

363
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,920
So I give you two bites.

364
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,920
Even if you give me the whole box, I won't eat it.

365
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,600
Oh! I'd want to gaze at the stars. Shall we go up on the roof and gaze at the stars?

366
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,980
Okay, I'll take you there.

367
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,220
Thanks.

368
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,120
The wind is so cold today.

369
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,000
Why did you bring me up here?

370
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,960
I first wanted to gaze at the stars for romance,

371
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,680
but now I'd want to ask you a question.

372
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,360
What would you like to ask me?

373
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,440
What is this? There are my candid photos.

374
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,840
Hey! Why did you find it?

375
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,120
You place it on the headboard next to the power bank.

376
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:53,320
I probably took it out and forgot to put it in place. I filmed it a long time ago since we weren't together yet.

377
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,960
You don't expect to see it again, Nhai. I'll annihilate it.

378
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:07,560
It's okay, I remember it all. You wrote the lyrics in the last picture, right?

379
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,440
What is the name of the song? I think it has a good meaning.

380
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,480
You’re my sunshine.

381
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
Please sing to me.

382
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,360
It's not finished yet, if it's done I'll sing it to you first.

383
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,600
Boo. What?

384
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,800
But I imagined singing it to you when I was writing this song.

385
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,240
As far as I read it, it is so cute.

386
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,720
It's as cute as you.

387
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Thank you for being my sunshine. Thank you for making my everyday meaningful.

388
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:09,920
Thank you for coming to make me more lively.

389
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:26,880
I also thank you for loving and accepting me for who I am.

390
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,520
Thank you for letting me know that it's not hard to love someone.

391
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,640
I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes first.

392
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,880
What? Will you tease me?

393
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,520
Alright, just close your eyes.

394
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,400
Let's keep collecting points until we have one hundred and one thousand loyalty cards.

395
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,240
Okay.

396
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,160
I love you, my yellow duck.

397
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,040
I love you too, duck owner.
