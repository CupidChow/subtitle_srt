1
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,400
Nhai, wake up.

2
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
The class is over, let's eat.

3
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
Come on, let's eat.

4
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Nhai, do you want to go back?
You still look so sleepy.

5
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,760
I don't want to skip school.

6
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
If you're going to sleep the whole class like this morning,

7
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,480
wouldn't it be better for you to sleep in your room?

8
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,200
It's almost time for the exam.

9
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
I don't want to study with my friends and graduate with a doctor.

10
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,160
And I want to stay and help you guys

11
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,840
with the group's exhibition.

12
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,720
Look at you. your condition is like withered vegetables.

13
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,660
You still want to help your friends?

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,400
Well, Nhai. I'll help you with lectures.

15
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,840
You can read my lectures.

16
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,550
I'll tutor you before the exam.

17
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,490
I want Pocky.

18
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,079
Nhai, I've already shared this with you.

19
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
I'll go buy it for you,

20
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
but now you just go back to rest.

21
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,550
Your face is red like you are getting sick.

22
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Does my body hot?

23
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,700
Yes.

24
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,970
You're still okay this morning.

25
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,580
The morning before I left,

26
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,770
I had taken my medicine.

27
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,920
So how are you now?

28
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,350
I have so much pain in my body.

29
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,450
And I'm very sleepy.

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,820
Then just go back to sleep.

31
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,700
And don't be stubborn, you know?

32
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,840
Why are you guys making faces like that?

33
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,300
Nothing.

34
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,310
Ai, you can take Nhai back to rest first.

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Umm... Then I'll go now.

36
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,500
Do you guys think the same as me?

37
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,830
What the heck do you think?

38
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
You see it, Ton.

39
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,160
They have something.

40
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,070
I'm sure.

41
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,360
Ton.

42
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,600
Don't interrupt me.

43
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,260
I know you feel weird.

44
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,820
Because you've been close friends with Nhai for a long time.

45
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,660
You may feel conflicted about how your best friend

46
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,850
has feelings for a man.

47
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't feel conflicted, dude.

48
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,950
But I wanted to drag Ai

49
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,850
to ask about their relationship.

50
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,430
Wipe your body before eating.

51
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,980
Actually, you don't have to wipe it.

52
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,770
I can get better after sleeping.

53
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,470
Just wipe it.

54
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
To make you better faster.

55
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,680
Just stop here.

56
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,240
- But...
- I said stop.

57
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,159
Okay.

58
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,970
I got it.

59
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
You're really worried about eating.

60
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
Would you like to eat it together?

61
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,280
I'll eat, if you have the kindness to share with me.

62
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,980
It's the money you bought it for.

63
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,679
Can you feed me?

64
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,880
No.

65
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,640
I don't have a hand for you.

66
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,280
Then, I'll eat from your mouth.

67
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,840
I'll just stop here for now.

68
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't want to tease people who are sick.

69
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm going to sleep now.

70
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
Good night, I wish I could live in your dreams

71
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,140
like I always have you in my dreams.

72
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,220
Are you awake?

73
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,590
Do you still have a headache?

74
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
I feel better now.

75
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,030
What are you doing?

76
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,270
Talk to the tree.

77
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,620
Huh?

78
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,380
Just kidding.

79
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
I'm watering the cactus.

80
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,700
Who gave it to you?

81
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,850
It's just a tree, it's not difficult to take care of.

82
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,280
Just water it once a week

83
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,490
and talk to them a bit.

84
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,100
That's all, right?

85
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,320
Ai, you need to take good care of them.

86
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,830
Don't forget to talk to them.

87
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,120
Okay.

88
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,310
I'll try my best.

89
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,200
You touch it like that,

90
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
you're breaking the thorn.

91
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,720
Hey, you hit me.

92
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
It turned red, you see?

93
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,360
I've been wondering for a long time.

94
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,160
About what Aiyaret cherishes.

95
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,560
Today

96
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,200
I found out that he cherishes the thorns of the cactus.

97
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Duck Nhai.
Don't touch it, do you understand?

98
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,170
Otherwise you will get hit like this.

99
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,060
Like this

100
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,180
Like this.

101
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,950
Alright.

102
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,070
I cherish it.

103
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,840
What do you cherish more

104
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,520
between the duck Nhai and the thorns of the cactus?

105
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
Of course, duck.

106
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,320
But you hit the duck just now.

107
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,920
It hurts a lot.

108
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,440
And I'm very sad.

109
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,830
Aside from you pleading with me so much,

110
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,120
you're really acting.

111
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,640
You're hungry, right? So you act like this.

112
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,490
Yes.

113
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,370
I'm very hungry.

114
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,430
Let's get something to eat.

115
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,480
Uh... My shampoo is empty.

116
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Take me to buy it too.

117
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I haven't washed my hair for two days.

118
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,070
Why are you so dirty?

119
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,440
I also have shampoo, why you not use it?

120
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,960
I don't like it, it has a strong smell.

121
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,120
I prefer using baby shampoo.

122
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,640
Do you use it in the shower as well?

123
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,640
I use it on my whole body.

124
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,160
It means,

125
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,120
besides you haven't washed your hair for two days,

126
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,660
you still haven't showered for two days.

127
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,510
Why is my wife so dirty?

128
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,260
I think I'll have to shower for you

129
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,630
before eating.

130
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,680
I have to rub soap for you here. Here, and here.

131
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,160
Ai, I feel tickled.

132
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,690
I want to tease you.

133
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,350
Hurry up and take a shower.

134
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,770
So we can go to eat.

135
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,000
I want to eat BBQ, can I?

136
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,640
Have I ever rejected you?

137
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,430
Never, you're so cute.

138
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,770
Get a reward from me.

139
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,040
You are... Really...

140
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,740
You always act cute

141
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,410
to make my heart flutter.

142
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,310
Hmm, my cheese.

143
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,020
Oh, sorry.

144
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,000
Ai, look at that table.

145
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,690
They looks at you too.

146
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm not interested.

147
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,680
If you read the text,

148
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,960
why did you call me out?

149
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,460
Just relax before the test.

150
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,040
Why don't you call Nhai here?

151
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,740
No.

152
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,000
Because I have something to ask you without Nhai.

153
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,960
Therefore, you must not avoid our questions.

154
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,850
Asking questions is boring,

155
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,600
let's play a game.

156
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,080
What game is it?

157
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,000
It's a Q&A game.

158
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
The rules are very simple.

159
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,099
If you ask and I don't answer,

160
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,599
I'll drink one shot.

161
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,240
But if you want me to answer it,

162
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,119
you have to drink two shots.

163
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,540
And if I still don't answer it,

164
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,859
I'll drink three shots.

165
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,200
Keep doing it

166
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,400
until someone gives up.

167
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
It looks fun, I'll play with you.

168
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,360
Shall we start?

169
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,480
Just ask your doubts about me.

170
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,420
Do you have feelings for Nhai?

171
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,800
I started with one shot.

172
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,560
Answer me.

173
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,240
Yes.

174
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,240
I had feelings for Nhai since the first time I met him.

175
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,760
The question is not difficult, but I'm afraid the game is not fun.

176
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,820
Damn.

177
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,510
Are you gay?

178
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,490
I am bisexual.

179
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,520
What about Nhai?

180
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I don't know about this.

181
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,320
You don't answer it, drink one more shot.

182
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,360
Hey, can you do this?

183
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,320
So you'll get two shots like me.

184
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,080
Hurry up and drink it, so I can continue asking you.

185
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,600
Yeah.

186
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,280
Are you two dating now?

187
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,040
We are dating.

188
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,160
Nhai said I could tell to you guys.

189
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,920
Because you guys are always snooping around.

190
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,240
Damn! You guys are as fast as Wi-Fi.

191
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,000
Have you guys exchanged passwords?

192
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,920
What's that word, Nai?

193
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,840
Exchanged passwords?

194
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,520
Does he know you hang out with us?

195
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,250
Yes.

196
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
He even told me to hang out.

197
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,880
I'm not that unreasonable.

198
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,520
He hangs out with Ton's group.

199
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,840
They definitely have to ask about our relationship.

200
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,560
I don't want to keep secrets from my friends.

201
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,290
But I don't see any reason to tell them.

202
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,920
But, yeah.

203
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,640
The fact that I have friends with prying behavior,

204
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,840
even if they don't tell them anything,
they will still pry until they know it.

205
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,270
If I had to guess,

206
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,880
they would definitely have Ai drink alcohol to get him drunk.

207
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,760
I had to tell Ai to take revenge on them.

208
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,520
Actually, we don't have any secrets to hide from you guys.

209
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,840
I just don't see a reason to announce it.

210
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
And...

211
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,440
You guys won't stop being friends with him, right?

212
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,170
If he dated me.

213
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,580
He really care about you guys.

214
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,570
Please tell it to him.

215
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,290
The reason why I compelled to ask you about it
is because we are worried about him.

216
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,680
What about you, Ai? How serious are your feelings for him?

217
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,520
I'm serious. I only have him.

218
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,120
Can you promise me

219
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
that you won't hurt Nhai?

220
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,070
I really love this friend.

221
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,260
I don't promise you.

222
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,090
Because I promised with Nhai,

223
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,370
not you.

224
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,120
Wow.

225
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,600
Who started flirting between the two of you?

226
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,380
How did your story begin?

227
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,160
Alright.
Who had feelings for each other first, between the two of you?

228
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
I don't know.

229
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,650
But I really love him.

230
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,330
Let me take care of him.

231
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,240
It took a long time for him to trust and date me.

232
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,690
Your friends are hard to flirt with.

233
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,920
He was slow and peculiar.

234
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,760
Also, he gets lost often.

235
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,790
From what I've heard from you,

236
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't see any advantage of him.

237
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,650
I just love him.

238
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,450
Where are you going?

239
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,840
I want to go back.

240
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,240
Hey, just sit.

241
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,080
It's not very often the heavyweight friends join us.

242
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,420
I'm still wondering

243
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,520
why I have to hang out with you guys.

244
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,750
It's friendship.

245
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,360
Lucky, lucky.

246
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,370
Lucky to have friends.

247
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,870
I love my friends.

248
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,680
Ton is drunk.

249
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,400
I won.

250
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,690
Wow, Ai.

251
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,200
You are no different from Ton.

252
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,790
Well, let's go back.

253
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,920
I want to go to Nhai's house.

254
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,320
Why are you going there?

255
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,200
That's it.

256
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,380
Intha, please take me to Nhai's house.

257
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,680
Intha.

258
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,950
Don't forget your phone.

259
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,280
You are so tall.

260
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Is this Nhai's house?

261
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,080
You say like you've never been here.

262
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,960
Usually, he always told me to park in front of the village.

263
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,180
He said his dad was strict, so he didn't want me to meet him.

264
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,440
His dad?

265
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,640
If his dad was strict, he wouldn't be like this.

266
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,600
How will you go back?

267
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,880
You can take my car back.

268
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,800
It's okay.

269
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,890
I have a sweetheart to pick me up.

270
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,900
Do you see that car?

271
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,200
Well, thank you for driving me here.

272
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,490
It's okay, Nhai is over there.

273
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,090
- See you.
- See you.

274
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Oh? You also drink with him?

275
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,160
Yeah.

276
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,280
Look at him.

277
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,640
He was drunk like a stray dog.

278
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,080
I can't stand him.

279
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,120
Look, he can't even drive.

280
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,380
Okay, I'll take care of him. See you.

281
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,520
What's up, Hubby? You're so drunk.

282
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,950
I'm better now.

283
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,960
What are you talking about with Intha?
You laughed so wide-mouthed.

284
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,610
He insulted me.

285
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,740
About when I threatened you that my dad was strict.

286
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,840
Can you tell me the truth?

287
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,940
If my dad is really strict,

288
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,640
do you think I will be like this?

289
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,230
I already told my dad,

290
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,980
about our relationship.

291
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Did you get scolded?

292
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,730
No.

293
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,480
He was just silent for a moment and said he wanted to see you.

294
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,280
He won't kill me, right?

295
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,760
Just pray.

296
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,630
But I'm giving him a lot of spoilers.

297
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,800
Will you enter my house or will you sleep in the car?

298
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,880
I can sleep anywhere...with you.

299
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,240
I don't like sleeping in the car.
Let's go to sleep in the room.

300
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,360
Then...

301
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,440
Let's make love on the car for one round.

302
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,400
Hey, you still won't stop talking about it.

303
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,040
Please?

304
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,350
We skipped it for several days.

305
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,070
I miss you.
I want to hug you. I want to...

306
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:04,880
Hey!

307
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,600
You sleep in the car.

308
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,430
I'll sleep in the house.

309
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,800
What's wrong with you?
It's in front of the house.

310
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,120
My car has a dark film.

311
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,200
No one can see it.

312
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,110
Your car doesn't have any lubricant.

313
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,660
It hurts, otherwise I'll have a fever again.

314
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,280
It's causing you trouble and taking care of me.

315
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,680
I have...

316
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,480
this.

317
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,360
Just eat it.

318
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,200
I always eat it when I'm drunk.

319
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,940
I'm not drunk.

320
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
Don't deny it, Aiyaret

321
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,810
I saw your body staggered as you got out of the car.

322
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,880
Hey, don't you think I'm so tired that my legs are shaking like you?

323
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
Just eat it.

324
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,840
Who do you live with?

325
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,400
I live here with my dad.

326
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,360
Here.

327
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,720
You really look like your mother.

328
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,800
What about you, father or mother?

329
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,500
Can I throw the trash there?

330
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,840
Send it to me, I'll throw the trash for you.

331
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,650
Are you going to bed now? You yawn many times.

332
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,160
Yes.

333
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,560
Okay, I'll go get more pillows, you can sleep now.

334
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,360
Well. Should I turn off the light?

335
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,000
You asked me just now, right? About who I look like.

336
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,760
I always thought about it that my face didn't look like my father at all.

337
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,160
Until I met my mother and I realized that...

338
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,930
I really look like her.

339
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,800
What did you just say? I couldn't catch it.

340
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,560
Nothing. Let's sleep.

341
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,320
If you're hot, just turn on the air conditioner, but hold me like this.

342
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,120
It would make me cold.

343
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:55,360
Being cute like me, how can it make me stop loving you? Naughty duck.

344
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,800
Ai, your phone.

345
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,720
Nhai, can I go to the bathroom? I want to brush my teeth.

346
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,960
Just answering your phone, it's annoying.

347
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,510
Where is my phone?

348
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,160
It's around here, I can feel the vibration.

349
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,300
Where is it?

350
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,679
You've been buzzing since this morning.

351
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,469
Same as you.

352
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,010
I just want to go to the bathroom. No one is as lustful as you.

353
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,900
I know where your cell phone is.

354
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,389
- Let me go, I'll pick it up for you.
- No.

355
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,080
Let me go. Let me go. I'll pick it up for you.

356
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,880
No, I'll pick it up myself.

357
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,560
Jom? Who is she?

358
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
Why don't you answer that call?

359
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,360
I don't want to answer the call right now.

360
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,720
What's wrong with you?

361
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,130
Is she your ex?

362
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,760
Your ex-girlfriend, right?
Is she the same person who called you at the BBQ restaurant?

363
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,390
Or do you have many ex-girlfriends?

364
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,520
Usually, how long have you been in a relationship? Tell me.

365
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:42,600
Aiyaret. You change your lover often.
You make me worried.

366
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,430
Hello, handsome boy.

367
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,680
Stop talking sweetly.
You always come back in the morning during this time.

368
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,200
Hey, I have to spend time with my husband.

369
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,320
But whose car is that? It looks familiar.

370
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,720
I think it's Nhai's friend's car. They come here at night.

371
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,360
He hasn't woken up yet.

372
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,450
Is he really just a friend?

373
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,840
She's not my ex. She is my younger sister.

374
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,240
I've helped her once.

375
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,440
So why don't you answer her call?

376
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,320
Even if I don't answer her calls, it still makes you jealous of me.

377
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,640
Me?

378
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Yes.

379
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,840
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

380
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,840
When I'm in a relationship with someone, I don't care about the past.

381
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,160
I just wanted to know if you change lovers often
and how long have you been in a relationship with.

382
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,720
I just want to prepare, in case you leave me.

383
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,400
But the monk taught me that, thinking about the past will make you suffer.

384
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,680
But thinking about the future also makes you suffer.

385
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,130
I should live in the present.

386
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,800
Why are you laughing?

387
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,360
I'm laughing at you.

388
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,520
I'll be mad at you if you don't stop laughing within ten seconds.

389
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,160
Okay, I'll stop now.

390
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,200
Come here.

391
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,070
I will answer you one question at a time.

392
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,390
Jom is the same person who called me at the BBQ restaurant.

393
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,800
For my previous relationship,

394
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,490
I only have two relationships in the past.

395
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,720
For the first one, I had puppy love in kindergarten.

396
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,740
I can't remember her name anymore.

397
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,050
I can remember that I held her hand to rest during the break.

398
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,320
For the second person, in the eighth grade.

399
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,320
The furthest thing was that I took her to the cinema.

400
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,890
For me, when I was in Canada.

401
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,540
I'm not in a relationship with anyone.

402
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,050
Nhai!

403
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,820
Open the door!

404
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,820
Your car is parked in front of the house.

405
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,320
That's my dad!
