Hey, that's Aiyaret.

I heard that he joined in the middle of the semester

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,960
because he got a special connection with the teacher here.

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
Look at that handsome face guy.

I have heard that he uses drugs.

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,160
He came back from overseas

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
because he escaped the case.

10
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
How many times do I have to tell you? He's wicked!

the handsome intelligent guy.

Although, he looks like a nerd,

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,040
His passion is board games. He's really addicted to it.

Good-looking, charming, and playful,

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,360
but actually his personality are completely different from his look

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,120
[Intha]
because this person likes to listen to Buddhist chanting.

cool biker that's makes many people fall in love with.

But literally his look

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
is just an illusion.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400

this biker always lost the way.

Didn't he sleep last night?

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,160
He's not sleepy

Ai, Kanliew already had a boyfriend.

I told you to hurry up and flirt. You refused to flirt her.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,640
How about it now?

Someone else date with her already.

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,800
Please stop saying that. Do you know that I'm in a lot of pain?

52

On that day,

everything is worse.

I like Ai.

138
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,480
Can you help me?

139
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
You shouldn't mess with him.

140
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,480
He's not good.

141

Go to ask him yourself.

147
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
It's just a few snacks that I will offer you.

Enough, no.

Nobody is good enough, no one is good for you.

151
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Did you have a lover and don't tell me?

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,640
Oh, I said no.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
Why do all the girls like you?

154
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I don't understand.

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,640
Really don't understand?

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,200
Each of them

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,240
keep calling you "Ai."

158
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm more handsome.

Don't make your face like duckie, I'll laugh.

160
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,840
I have someone I think I like.

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Huh?

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,320
Who?

Tell me.

169

We just arrived.

170
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Is this your condo?

171
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,040
It's very close to the university.

172
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
Yes.

173
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,800
My new best friend's condo.

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,320
You and you and you

175
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,080
are no longer my favorite.

176
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,640
Let's go, please come this way.

177
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,480
Best friend,

178
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,120
come on.

179
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,240
So we are no longer Nhai favourite's?

180
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
Oh!

181
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
Your room is super clean.

182
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,920
If you don't tell me this is your room,

183
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
I thought it was the Prince's room.

184
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,520
Really super clean.

185
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,880
Is the word Prince Ai really exaggerated?

186
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,720
You guys make your self at home.

187
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,160
Ai.

188
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,960
Huh?

189
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,960
Why did you buy this condo?

190
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm rich.

191
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,280
just kidding.

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
My father and adoptive father bought it.

193
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,360
because it's near the university.

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,640
Wait,

195
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,240
you'll say father

196
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,560
with your adoptive father.

197
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
You have two fathers?

198
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,640
Yes.

199
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,640
My father used to be a teacher at a university.

200
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
and know with Professor Amnat.

201
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,160
and another one, my adoptive father.

202
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,160
staying at Nan.

203
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,040
My house is actually in Nan.

204
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
For semester break,

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
you guys should go to my house at Nan.

206
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
I've invited Nhai.

207
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,400
I used to doubt how you can enter during the mid-semester.

208
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr.Ai is really not normal.

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,720
Oh yes, I am special.

210
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm sorry to ask

211
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,200
that a rumor about your violent case. Is it true?

212
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,640
Please tell us.

213
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,080
Open your mind tonight.

214
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,760
I'm not addicted to drugs or anything.

215
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,120
I just got kicked out and expelled from university because of brawl.

216
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,960
Huh?

217
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
According from your handsome face,

218
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,760
I don't think you're going to fight with anyone.

219
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,440
I'm less hot-headed than you, Ton.

220
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,560
I'm busy.

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
Thirsty.

222
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,800
Happy.

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,320
Where is my duck?

224
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,240
Ai,

225
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,720
did you see my key chain?

226
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,920
In the car.

227
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,120
Keep it there, it won't disappear.

228
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
Relieved.

229
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
I don't know when my Dad will let me stop taking care of Mr. Ducky.

230
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,320
When you stop losing your key chain.

231
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,640
I see only Ai looking after duck key chain for you.

232
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
You like to leave your key chain everywhere.

233
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,800
Leave everywhere? Are you serious ?

234
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,040
Are you Looking for Yellow Duck?

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,840
- You like to lose it
- Give it back to me.

236
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,480
- Who told you to lose it
- Give it back.

237
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
I have good responsibility.

238
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm not just taking care of duck.

239
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,160
I take care of both people and duck.

240
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,320
Especially duck keychain's owner

241
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,760
since he keeps losing the way all the time.

242
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,440
Silent.

243
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,400
You..

244
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,960
Hairless arms.

245
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
Hairless arms?

246
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,480
Slippery texture, try it.

247
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,160
Ah.

248
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,760
Yeah.

249
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,680
You don't have say it.

250
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
I will Ignore.

251
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,560
Come cheers.

252
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,520
- Bottom up.
- Cheers.

253
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,720
You know?

254
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
I take care of you better than you take care of the duck.

255
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
When I first met you.

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
I like you

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,840
because your face is like JaoNan.

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,680
But when I getting to know you,

259
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,680
You are unique.

260
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,200
You know what?

261
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,400
I had a dream of you many times.

262
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Dream that you and I love each other.

263
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,040
Wake up and see you in real life.

264
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,960
See your smile.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I know i can't just be your friend.

266
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,400
I really like you Nhai.

267
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
I want to pee.

268
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,760
Ai,

269
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,520
where is the bathroom?

270
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,920
Right there, the room with light on.

271
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,200
Can you go by yourself?

272
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
Yeah.

273
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Wait a minute.

274
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,000
Are you alright?

275
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Ai.

276
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,680
You are very handsome

277
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,720
You're drunk, go to sleep.

278
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,040
I have something to say.

279
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,400
Move closer.

280
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,560
I like you very much.

281
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,600
Like you.

282
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,400
You know?

283
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
You are a very good friend.

284
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,400
I like you taking care of me,

285
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,920
take care of Mr. Ducky,

286
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,480
and let me do anything I want.

287
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,720
I like everything.

288
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,800
Thanks

289
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
Give me a kiss as a reward for 10 times.

290
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,079
Come?

291
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,160
Nhai.

292
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
What are you doing?

293
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Your cheeks are so soft,

294
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
also authentic.

295
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,440
I smell liquor in your breath.

296
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,040
Nhai.

297
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,440
You might regret if you don’t stop provoking me

298
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,720
What regret? people like Chen Nhai

299
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,080
no regrets.

300
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,560
Nhai.

301
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,280
Stop, that's it.

302
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,960
Don't scold.

303
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,080
You're much cuter when you're kind.

304
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,800
I can't take it anymore.

305
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,640
So who told you to endure it?

306
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,360
Wait.

307
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,680
if you're not ok I can stop.

308
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,880
Is it cold? I'll go adjust the air conditioner.

309
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,120
OK.

310
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,440
I'll go back to my dormitory.

311
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,840
What's the matter?

312
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,080
why are you crying?

313
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,120
It's OK.

314
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,440
I go back to the dormitory.

315
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
I'll send you.

316
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,400
No problem.

317
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
I can go back myself.

318
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,560
So go back in the morning?

319
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,520
Ton can send you back.

320
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,320
No.

321
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,400
I'll go back now.

322
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,520
Are you mad at me?

323
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,000
I am sorry.

324
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,480
I'm not mad at you.

325
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,200
Then I'll send you.

326
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,920
No.

327
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,960
I'll Go back first.

328
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,400
I'll send you.

329
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,920
Stop.

330
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,800
Just stop right there.

331
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
If you follow me, I will be mad.

332
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,520
Let me review myself.

333
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Don't mess with me.

334
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,840
What have I done?

335
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm sorry, Ai.

336
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,120
It's my fault. Will I get into the face of the person you like?

337
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
Hey A.I.

338
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,800
Hello, how are you?

339
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,680
Can I help?

340
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,160
the story is..

341
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
I accidentally make love with my friend.

342
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,360
What should I do?

343
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,240
What's your friend's name.

344
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,440
Actually, I don't know you at all.

345
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,760
Please tell me to go into settings and Tap on my info.

346
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
What the hell am I doing?

347
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,040
So..why do I feel good about it

348
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,560
Oh.

349
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,160
Get out of my head.

350
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,400
Oh....

351
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,440
Damn

352
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,360
How to.

353
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,200
Something that doesn't mean you're gay.

354
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,320
First,

355
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,960
same-sex admiration.

356
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,840
This doesn't mean you're gay.

357
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,480
So I told Ai that he is handsome,

358
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,800
doesn't mean I am gay.

359
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,080
Second,

360
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,400
just accidentally making love with the people in the same gender.

361
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
This doesn't mean you're gay.

362
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,680
Huh

363
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,480
Is it true?

364
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,360
Third,

365
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,240
understanding the meaning of transgender

366
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,520
that women want to be men. Men want to be a women.

367
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,200
Then, is this mean I want to be a woman?

368
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,600
Oh my god.

369
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,760
Deja Vu? I saw Singh have done this since I was a kid.

370
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,440
Hey.

371
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,120
Singh.

372
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,240
Yeah! How could I forget my brother, Singh?

373
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Hello brother, Singh.

374
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,600
I have something to discuss.

375
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
I'll Go to see you now.

376
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,280
OK, see you.

377
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,360
Here you guys keep texting me like I'm going to die in that room.

378
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,080
What is this?

379
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,120
Intha again.

380
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,840
Sending "Hello Friday" text to me

381
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,760
makes me miss my dad.

382
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,360
OMG!

383
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,280
I tries not to read AI message.

384
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,880
I bought a porridge for you hang in front of the door.

385
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,160
I know you haven't eaten since this morning.

386
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,320
Hurry up and eat it before it gets cold.

387
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,280
I already put Mr. Ducky you forgot in the bag.

388
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,440
I'm going back.

389
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
Take care of yourself.

390
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,320
I forgot my duck.

391
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,040
Almost gone.

392
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,320
Chen Nhai's porridge has to be extra pork, add liver, add egg, and crispy noodles.

393
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,840
What else?

394
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,800
Oh no vegetables.

395
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,840
So you bought it right?

396
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,240
Eat some soft food for now.

397
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Take anti-inflammatory and antipyretic too. Don't be stubborn, I'm worried.

398
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,240
Why take medicine? I'm okay.

399
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,560
Even I brought Mr.Duck back to the place.

400
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,080
You can still drop it.

401
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,040
Then,

402
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,080
I'm taking it as a hostage.

403
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,880
When you are ready to talk to me, I'll give it back.

404
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,840
Oh, Mr. Ducky.

405
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,480
Where did it fall?

406
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,760
I thought you already go back.

407
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
Put the duck in front of the door.

408
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,760
I'll go get it.

409
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Why is there no signal?

410
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,520
I can't connect.

411
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,880
Battery dead, what?

412
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
better to take Mr. Ducky back home.

413
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,200
“You pissed me off”

414
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
Yellow ducky!

415
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,880
I don't know

416
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,440
how long will you be mad at me?

417
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,920
but take medicine too.

418
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,920
I said I was worried.

419
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm serious.

420
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,240
Oh Nhai.

421
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,480
Hello!

422
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Hello sir.

423
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh! Chen Nhai.

424
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,240
Where have you been?

425
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,400
Why do you look so deteriorating?

426
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,680
I'm so nervous that I can't sleep.

427
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,720
Oh isn't Vievie here?

428
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
Normally, I will see him around

429
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,720
he normally fear of you taking over the business.

430
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,280
Silent.

431
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,240
People like me never cheat on anyone.

432
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
As you said that you are frustrated, what is it about?

433
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,760
Is there something to discuss with me?

434
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,840
Yeah

435
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,720
Singh.

436
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Stop!

437
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,200
My name is Sweetie.

438
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Shorter name for the most beautiful Sweetie one in the area.

439
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,400
Call my name correctly!

440
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,960
Sweetie, would you like a mirror?

441
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,760
Why?

442
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,120
Are you going to bully me, eh?

443
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,240
With Vievie why don't you call him Veerapon?

444
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,880
Oh no don't be mad, it's not pretty.

445
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,040
Tae.

446
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,040
Please give me a glass of soft alcohol, I need to drink now.

447
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,880
I got it.

448
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,280
Stop it, Tae.

449
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,400
Nhai bullies my beautiful face.

450
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,760
Chen Nai's pretty Sweetie, I'm apologized.

451
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,600
I have a dry throat now. Can I have a sip or two, please?

452
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,960
Yeah.

453
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,040
Then what's the matter?

454
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,120
Well, the other day I was drunk.

455
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,040
And accidentally make love with my friend.

456
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,360
Wow Chen Nhai, how can you do this?

457
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,880
Are you not protected? But this hasn't been 48 hours yet. Still taking birth control pills.

458
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,360
Friend.. he is a man.

459
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,960
Yeah, so your friend are not pregnant.

460
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,520
Huh!

461
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,920
Who are you making love with male? Then why isn't that person me?

462
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,920
I'm screwed.

463
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,040
You can't even look at your friend's face.

464
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,400
Umm.

465
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,160
But he doesn't say anything.

466
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
So you don't have to worry about it. Things like this happen all the time.

467
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,040
Take it as a life experience.

468
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,360
But it feels good,

469
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,160
extremely good.

470
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,280
Better than with a lady?

471
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,960
Probably better.

472
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,320
Ugh. I don't know.

473
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,840
Hasn't been one for a long time.

474
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,320
I'm glad that you found your way.

475
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,560
Calm down you will get drunk.

476
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,040
Keep going, I think you found the right path.

477
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,200
Not true. When I watch porn, it doesn't feel right.

478
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,640
But when I think about it with my friends,

479
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,320
I have a feeling.

480
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,120
Then, there is a high probability that you are bi-sexual.

481
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,320
Or, you just secretly like your friend.

482
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,920
I don't like him that way.

483
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,360
He also got someone that he like.

484
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,400
I think I'm just more confused

485
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
that i am gay or not.

486
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,200
Why is this so complicated?

487
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,440
I guess you have to try one more time.

488
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,840
Come on, come on!

489
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Try it with me once.

490
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,040
Oh, Singh.

491
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
Don't scare me like when I was a kid.

492
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,720
Come and kiss.

493
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,320
- Sing
- Oh

494
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,440
- Hey what
- Hey, stop.

495
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,600
You should stop.

497
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,800
Are you yelling at me?

498
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,040
Yeah!

499
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,200
Calm down.

500
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,960
What's going on?

501
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,000
Nhai

502
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,240
Is he your friend. That you told me just now.

503
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,480
Yes, this guy. Let me use the back area of the bar for a while.

504
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,880
You come here.

505
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,440
What wrong with you?

506
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,720
I'm going crazy because of you.

507
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,040
Are you mad that I'm drunk and make love with you?

508
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,600
I don't want it to be like this,

510
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,840
but it already happened.

511
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,280
What do you want me to do?

512
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,800
I'm not mad at you for that.

513
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,760
Why are you mad at me?

514
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,640
Why are you running away from me?

515
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm not angry.

516
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,640
I'm just afraid you can't accept it.

517
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,800
I'm afraid you don't want to be my friend.

518
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,760
Yeah!

519
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,440
I don't want to be your friend.

520
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,679
That's it.

521
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,760
See?

522
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You listen to me

523
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,239
you don't have to talk.

524
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,239
I'm so jealous of you.

525
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,760
Do you still want me to be your friend?

526
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,480
I'm jealous of you

527
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,840
because I like you.

528
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,679
I like you since the first time I met you.

529
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,880
I  like you more and more.

530
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,680
Huh..you

531
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,960
- What is this?
- If you hate me

532
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,440
just say it and I'll go.

533
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,280
No.

534
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,760
Not like that.

535
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,080
I really like you.

536
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,240
be my lover, Please.

537
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Ai

538
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,480
Pardon?

539
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,920
Your room is too quiet.

540
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,000
Can you play music?

541
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,520
Can I sing for you then?

542
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
But can only sing love songs.

543
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,200
Is there any soft drink in your room?

544
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,800
I want to drink

545
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
Ok, What is the answer?

546
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,080
That's a very direct question.

547
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,760
You like being incomprehensible. I have to ask you directly.

548
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,320
Nhai,

549
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,640
think carefully.

550
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,960
If you reject my love,

551
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,240
who will keep the ducks for you?

552
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,720
Who will take you out to eat delicious food?

553
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,680
who will pick you up? when you're lost

554
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,680
Who will wake you up in the morning?

555
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,680
Who will tell you, Good night before bed?

556
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,480
From what you just said, these were done as a friend, wasn't it?

557
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,840
Friend won't do that

558
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,720
I confessed my love to you already.

559
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,320
If you reject me, how can I face you?

560
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,960
But that's your decision.

561
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,240
If you say no, I'm just heartbroken.

562
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,120
But don't worry,

563
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,200
I'll ask my father to move back to Canada.

564
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,120
Because my father used to heartbroken

565
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,960
and been away for 7 years.

566
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,120
Oh, 7 years?

567
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,200
Yeah

568
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,520
Listen Ai

569
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,200
I've always been a guy who likes girls.

570
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,080
Now I'm confused.

571
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,800
So what?

572
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,840
I'm sure I don't like you that way.

573
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,320
If you to be in a relationship with me, I think it is wrong.

574
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
It hurts

575
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,400
but I don't want you to go away.

576
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,920
Actually..I don't even like making things complicated.

577
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,360
But this is hard to answer

578
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,160
because I'm really confused.

579
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,640
Well

580
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,240
I'm already confused about my situation.

581
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,360
should you and I stay together?

582
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,360
1 month.

583
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,960
I don't know if you like me.

584
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,600
Do you really like me?

585
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,920
Because there are some habits that I don't reveal to my friends

586
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,160
which I know you have so.

587
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,880
Be yourself

588
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,520
all the time we're together.

589
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,840
After that,

590
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,640
If you like me

591
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,000
and I like you,

592
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,960
if I'm okay with having a real male lover,

593
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,240
we will be together.

594
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,200
but if not We will go back to be friends as usual

595
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,200
without any condition.

596
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Deal.

597
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,720
Anything else?

598
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,120
Let's just say that all previous partners that I dated

599
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,400
no one can stand me.

600
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,160
Are you threatening me?

601
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,520
No.

602
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,920
Come here.

603
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,120
I have something to ask.

604
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,000
Umm.

605
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,080
For the duration of one month together,

606
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,880
Can we make love?

607
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,040
What?!

608
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,640
Scolding doesn't mean denying this.

609
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,240
So where are you going?

610
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,040
This size of my room you're still lost.

611
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,760
And how would you be fascinated with me?

612
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,640
Shut up.

613
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,280
Can you send me home?

614
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,160
I don't like driving at night.

615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,440
Then you can send me at the lobby,

616
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,320
I'll call a taxi.

617
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,880
Your condo is like a maze.

618
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm too lazy to walk.

619
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,200
What are you going to do with me, Mr. Aiyaret?

620
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,240
I  can't please you, you stop smiling now.

621
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,280
It's late now you should sleep here.

622
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,360
We have to be together for a month. Let's Start today.

623
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,480
Really?

624
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,040
But, I don't have any clothes.

625
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,680
Wear my stuff.

626
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,360
I don't have a toothbrush.

627
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,480
I have

628
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,000
and I have everything for you.

629
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,120
Ugh.

630
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,840
I better take a shower now, I sweat like a sinner in church.

631
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,360
Hey!

632
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,320
Nhai.

633
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,920
You can't take off your clothes here.

634
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,280
Well, That's my habit.

635
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,440
I'm going to take it off here, so?

636
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,560
If you can't accept it, just turn to be friend with me.

637
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,160
Hurry up and take a shower. Let me wash the clothes for you

638
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,640
No need.

639
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,680
If you don't hurry up and take a shower I will make love to you now.

640
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,440
I'm going to hate you today.

641
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,720
But I like you.

642
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,080
Yeah, I know.
