2
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,880
Hey!

3
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,250
That's Jida.

4
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,800
She handed the phone to Ai.

5
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Ton!

6
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Do you think Ai will give his contact to Jida?

7
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,000
I don’t know. Ai pressed the phone now. Either phone number or line ID?

8
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,520
Then...

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,979
I'll go and check.

10
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,509
Where are you going? In is about to tell us to go to the field.

11
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,880
About Ai’s matter, we can force him to tell us later.

12
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,350
Hey. I'm...

13
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,630
If you don't find a girlfriend, you'll see your friends keep falling in love like this.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
Let's get to the field.

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,479
Ouch!

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,910
Mr. duck!

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
Are you The Flash? You run so fast.

18
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200
Are you playing a joke at this time?

19
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,920
Can you stand up?

20
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,360
Yes, but can I sit and take a break first?

21
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,920
I brought an ice pack for you. Just put a compress on Nhai.

22
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
Thank you very much, Jida.

23
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,880
It's okay.

24
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,640
I’m just short of breath.

25
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,079
Intha.

26
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,290
What's wrong with you?

27
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,400
Nhai, I'm sorry. I'll buy you some water.

28
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,360
Hurry up, come on.

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,040
Are you okay?

30
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
Your symptoms are not severe.

31
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,079
Apply a cold compress first.

32
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,010
I don't want to.

33
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,680
Don't be stubborn, Mr. duck.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,760
Ai called Nhai is so cute.

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,079
Mr. duck suits with Nhai.

36
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
I’m not like duck.

37
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,640
And I don't like anyone calling me Mr. duck too.

38
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
What's wrong with you, Nhai?

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,700
Nothing.

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,360
Are you going back yet? If not, I'll go back with Intha.

41
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going back now, and you're just going back with me.

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,079
Ouch! Intha. Help me, please.

43
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,640
Ai is about to kill me.

44
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,190
Nhai.

45
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,440
If you don't shut up, I'll carry you right here.

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,600
Even though I'm strong, but... can you treat me a little bit softer?

47
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,640
I hold you softer than Intha does.

48
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,960
It isn't. You hold me too hard.

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,640
Is it because I don't let you drink sugary drinks? So you get mad at me.

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,300
Shut up.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,280
I am not that greedy.

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,080
You're cocky. If I saw you lying in bed and got body aches. I will ignore you. You'll see.

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,240
Ai and Nhai are really close, right?

54
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,670
They are close like this. They always play together.

55
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,240
When Nhai was yelling, he was very cute. I want to tease him.

56
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,800
You can't tease him. Ai is taking care of him all the time.

57
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,740
I think these two look like a lover.

58
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,800
Lover? They are just close friends.

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,000
Would you like to try to prove it?

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,360
How?

61
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,470
I think you guys are curious, but you just don't say it.

62
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,120
When I talked to Ai, Ai only looked at Nhai. When Nhai fell off,

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,000
Ai ran to Nhai first, although Ton was closer.

64
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,750
It's nonsense.

65
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,800
So if you don't believe me, you can try and observe yourself.

66
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,500
Let’s go, Jida.

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
I have to go now. See you later.

68
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,200
Do you think what Jida said is true?

69
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,320
Is there any evidence?

70
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,640
When In let me call Nhai, I saw Nhai looking at Ai like he was dreaming.

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,520
Could it be peeking at a girl?

72
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,230
Ai hugged Nhai as he lifted him up.

73
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,240
Nhai and I like to spoon in high school.

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, but this morning, Nhai came with Ai.

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,720
Nai, this morning you came with Ton as well.

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,040
Nhai's neck has a kiss mark.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,880
Maybe Nhai went to clubs and got kisses from women like Intha.

78
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,440
The week before, they fought.

79
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
It's just an argument, isn't it?

80
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,930
They call each other by special nicknames.

81
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,400
I think it's not clear enough. We have to prove it, as Jida said.

82
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,300
How?

83
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,480
Just asked Ai directly.

84
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
That's not easy.

85
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,390
No. I think we better observe their behaviours first.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,840
If there's anything more, then forces them to answer.

87
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,160
I agree. We don't have to hurry. Just wait and see.

88
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,080
Well, forget about them. Let's focus on us.

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,170
What?

90
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Let's party tonight. It has been a while since I've been to parties.

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,880
Your friend just got hurt.

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,440
But it's okay. I always go with you.

93
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm not pretending. I'm really sick.

94
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,210
Can you lighten it a bit?

95
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,760
Umm... It's so bruised. Just cold compress first and hot compress tomorrow.

96
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,000
I know I'm handsome. You don't have to stare at me that much.

97
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,230
I can't look at you now?

98
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,169
Just only me and you.

99
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,600
Don't let me look at you. Which duck would you have me look at?

100
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,520
You can provoke me normally when we're alone.

101
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,280
But why are you so mad at the basketball court?

102
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,680
You said you were considering the relationship with me.

103
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,920
Yeah. These days I thought I was living before marriage.

104
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Can't you just change the topic?

105
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Okay, please continue.

106
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,800
If you want to keep a relationship with me, you cannot give your number to Jida.

107
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,080
What are you muttering?

108
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,320
I said if you want to keep a relationship with me, you cannot give your number to Jida.

109
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,440
The reason he was upset was that he was jealous

110
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,520
Why?

111
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,320
It can't be. You shouldn't flirt with two people at once.

112
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,520
I have to choose who I'm going to talk to, right?

113
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,840
Yeah.

114
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,560
Jida is good because she has a white and bright skin tone.

115
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,800
You don't even consider it.

116
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,560
My past behaviours wasn't clear enough?

117
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,400
Oh my, I was heartbroken as soon as I 9realized I had feelings for you?

118
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:02,600
Do I have to ask him to reconcile? But first, he had to admit that he liked me.

119
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,800
Will he collect things without saying anything? Well, if you want, I'll help you

120
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Look at him. I think he'll put it back and beg me to stay

121
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,680
I didn't even have time to cry

122
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,950
I can do it myself.

123
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,160
It's okay. I'll help you.

124
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,200
You don't even ask me what I'm packing my stuff for?

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:36,480
Some things you have to say for yourself. I don't want to force you to speak out.

126
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,800
Yes, something Nhai had to say for himself. Especially the feeling

127
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,520
I don't want to imagine myself. Because if it didn't match, I would...

128
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,000
I will go back to my condo.

129
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,760
That's all?

130
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,280
Say it, say it. Tell me you like me

131
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,200
Yeah. That's all.

132
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,880
In the end, Nhai didn't say it

133
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,590
I'm imagining going on my own that we feel the same?

134
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,900
Are we ending?

135
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,520
No, I never gave up before I started

136
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,400
Forget it. I think our actions were clear enough to keep him with me

137
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,920
Stay with me, Nhai.

138
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,720
I won't let you go.

139
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,200
Just my long legs. How can I compare with Jida's white legs?

140
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,310
Yes, that's it

141
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,140
Are you still okay?

142
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,150
Of course.

143
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,680
You know? I liked you from the beginning because of your long legs.

144
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,320
I shouldn't just look at your legs.

145
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,640
Just say you like me.

146
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,360
It's useless now.

147
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,640
Just say it, Nhai.

148
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,120
I said it was useless.

149
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,440
Yeah.

150
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,270
Then I'll say it myself.

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,730
I love you.

152
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,470
Not just your legs.

153
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
I like your whole body.

154
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,940
Can you say it to me?

155
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:13,690
Yeah.

156
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,360
I...

157
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,440
You slow.

158
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,850
I love...

159
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,670
Your voice is too soft.

160
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,280
Ai, I love you. I love you. Can you hear that?

161
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,060
Please stop kissing me.

162
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,580
Hey...

163
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,600
What are you going to do?

164
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,520
Nhai... Look at my face.

165
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm still okay, but please calm down.

166
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,080
Let's stop and talk first.

167
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,760
You can keep doing this.

168
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,730
I'm excited. It made my body tense.

169
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,760
If you're afraid like this, it hurts. If you are not happy, I don't want to.

170
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

171
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,160
For you, I don't just want sex.

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,600
If we're going to make love. It must be happiness, not pain.

173
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:19,080
And most importantly, I want to touch you. I want to touch you in the part that no one has ever touched

174
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,520
and want to emphasize that you are mine.

175
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,000
Chen Nhai belongs to Aiyaret.

176
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Trust me.

177
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:45,400
It's not that I don't trust you. I know it feels good, but what will happen after this?

178
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,560
If the next day we cannot keep our relationship. I wouldn't know which way I had to go next.

179
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,240
Go back to the old life, get married, have a family

180
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,840
or find someone to replace you. I am overthinking until my headache.

181
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,599
Look, even I make love with you once, I'm still addicted to you.

182
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,640
And if we are together and make love often. If we break up, I will surely die.

183
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
Are you saying I can't leave you after we make love?

184
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,040
Yes, something like that.

185
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,800
I want to be with you forever. We must not leave each other.

186
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,840
Because I can't find someone as weird as you anywhere.

187
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,080
After I heard it, I had the strength to give my body to you.

188
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,040
Are you sarcastic me?

189
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,170
Yes.

190
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,200
Nhai.

191
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,160
I promise you that I won't leave you.

192
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,760
And I'll do the homework so many times, make you addict to our touch.

193
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,560
So that you stop thinking of looking for someone to replace me.

194
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,440
You must cherish me.

195
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,440
Okay, I'll cherish you.

196
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Are you okay, Mr. duck?

197
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Umm. I'm fine.

198
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,130
I'm hungry.

199
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,760
Take a shower first. You have to take both medicine and food.

200
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,040
Do you want to know what I'm talking to Jida?

201
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,120
I don't want to know what you're talking about.

202
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,180
I just want to know if you gave Jida your number.

203
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
It's nonsense.

204
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,680
The Omikuji prophecy told me that I will be fulfilled in love.

205
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,320
Did Omikuji say that you can get a jealous boyfriend?

206
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,280
My red duck always makes my heart flutter.

207
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Have you finished your shower yet? I'm hungry.

208
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,160
It seems that you still have energy.

209
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,080
Another round?

210
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,320
I haven't finished speaking yet, Hubby.

211
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,280
If you finished, please carry me out. I don't have any energy left.

212
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,320
What did you call me just now?

213
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,720
Hubby.

214
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Why? Can't I call you like that?

215
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,100
Sure, but when I hear it, I want to make love to you again.

216
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,190
Ouch, I can't take it anymore.

217
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,140
Stop it.

218
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,120
Signature, please.

219
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,020
It's yours.

220
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,080
Thank you.

221
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,040
When ordering, he turned his back and didn't see who ordered it.

222
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,560
Hmm...

223
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,040
By the way, is it your first time here? I've never seen you.

224
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,800
Yes, I'm here for the first time.

225
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
Did you come alone? Mr...?

226
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,160
Song. My name is Song.

227
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm In.

228
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,320
Yes.

229
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,100
Actually, I made a late-night meeting with a friend. But I might be too quick.

230
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,280
If you're okay, would you like me to sit and wait for them with you?

231
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,640
Yes.

232
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,160
My friend has arrived. I have to go sit with my friends. Excuse me.

233
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

234
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,840
What's wrong?

235
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,480
May I have your contact?

236
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,010
How are you, girl? Is the mission complete?

237
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,730
I sat far away because I was afraid that In would see me.

238
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,430
It's me.

239
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,960
You see? It's not hard. You just give him a snack.

240
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:35,640
I don't have the courage. Besides, you know that my relationship with In is impossible.

241
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,750
Song...

242
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,680
It's okay. I'll create a new memory between me and In.

243
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
That's it, my girl.

244
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,930
You smile even it hasn't started yet.

245
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,760
Wait a minute. It's almost cooked.

246
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,380
You can sleep now.

247
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,210
Why is your body so hot?

248
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,400
Nhai. Nhai. Can you hear me?

249
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm hungry.

250
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,200
There was no food left.

251
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,060
Nhai, I only slept for an hour. You had been making noise since morning.

252
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,530
What are you looking for, babe?

253
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,040
My duck.

254
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,000
Here it is. I'm hugging it.

255
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,120
No, I mean my yellow duck keychain.

256
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,090
Well, there is only my duck Nhai in my head.

257
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,640
You talk too much. Let's go take a shower. I'm hungry.

258
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,770
What would you like to eat? So I can do it.

259
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,690
No, we're late.

260
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,320
I can find something at the university.

261
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Oh, it seems I never took you to my college cafeteria.

262
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,330
Take me. Take me to reveal our relationship.

263
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,200
It broadens one's view, isn't it? I'm not surprised you got a D grade in the Thai language.

264
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,680
I'm just not good at reading and writing. I don't have a problem with listening and speaking.

265
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,800
It's correct that I say reveal the relationship. I will reveal that I am the owner of the duck.

266
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,830
It's exaggerated.

267
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,910
Who will pay attention to me when I walk with you?

268
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,500
Everyone only looks at you.

269
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm sorry that I was born as handsome as my father.

270
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,950
Oh? What did I say wrong?

271
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,880
Ai, there's going to be an exam in two weeks.

272
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,040
It has an elective subject in the Thai language.

273
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,560
I don't care. It's not that hard.

274
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,720
Didn't the aunt next door ask about your grades?

275
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,520
No, I have no neighbours.

276
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,700
Well, I will help you with Thai language courses

277
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,450
and you tutored the air shaft structure for me.

278
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,360
You got a full score on the last quiz. It's very difficult.

279
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,880
Even Nai, he didn't get a full score.

280
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,040
If I didn't get full marks, Phor Sip would kill me. My father used to be a teacher in this subject.

281
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,120
When he visited me in Canada, he always took the text along and watched me read it.

282
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,310
It might be easy for you.

283
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,000
Not that much.

284
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,920
You're slow. I'll help you.

285
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,800
The reason I'm slow is that I need my wife to help me.

286
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,160
You deserve it.

287
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,680
How are you, Nhai? I heard you were hit by In's basketball.

288
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,600
Yes.

289
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,840
It hit my stomach.

290
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,160
Why don't you stay at home for few days?

291
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,200
It's not a big deal. It's very chill.

292
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,760
Well, see you.

293
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,110
Hello, Dee Dee. You're so cute.

294
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,910
He smiles at everyone

295
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,500
- Hey, Chompoo.
- I admit that I'm jealous of him

296
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,350
Your face is as sweet as your name today.

297
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,360
I wanted to hang a sign on his neck that Chen Nhai is already owned

298
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,570
And the owner cherishes him very much

299
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:26,030
But Nhai and I have already agreed that we will not reveal our relationship

300
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,520
Nhai?

301
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
About our relationship.

302
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,040
Do you want me to tell other people?

303
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:58,560
If someone asks, you can tell. For me, it's not a secret. But it's about the two of us.

304
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,810
We don't need to announce it.

305
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,159
Or would you like to tell others?

306
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,760
Ai, remember it. If you love someone

307
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,480
You shouldn't change another person's daily life,

308
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,960
But just getting into it as an important part. Be honest with each other.

309
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,440
Take care of each other.

310
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,480
This is enough.

311
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:42,960
Ai.

312
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,239
What do you want to eat?

313
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,400
I don't know.

314
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,760
And you? I will buy it myself.

315
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,880
I can walk and buy it myself.

316
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,429
You should be able to walk properly. Just sit there.

317
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,810
Just tell me what you want to eat.

318
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,050
So, I want pork leg stew with rice over there.

319
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,140
Tell the vendor that it's Chen Nhai's order, second-year aviation.

320
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,400
Add eggs, add pork skin, and kaki.

321
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,290
And soup dumplings

322
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,480
with the half a spoon of chili powder.

323
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,640
a spoon of Sugar, a spoon of vinegar,

324
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,150
but no pickled peppers in vinegar.

325
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,250
Do not add fish sauce.

326
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,360
Because she's already cooking salty food.

327
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,480
And dessert...

328
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,770
What should I eat?

329
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,960
Hey!

330
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,680
Don't look at me like that.

331
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,640
I haven't eaten much.

332
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,590
But my motto is

333
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,500
when eating food and not eating sweets, it's the way of the poor.

334
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,520
So I want taro milk tea with pearls for dessert.

335
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,680
Only 50% sweetness and...

336
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,600
I want coconut milk ice cream on top.

337
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,360
And take one pack of gum. That's all.

338
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,540
This is my one meal.

339
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,070
Your one meal is too much. I can't afford it.

340
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,560
Please give me some money.

341
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,400
Pay me first.

342
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,480
When you refund me, I don't take the money.

343
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,560
But I want...

344
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,200
You.

345
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,800
Hey, Ai. Just hurry up and buy some food.

346
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,880
Hurry up, I'll be desolate in anger.

347
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,090
You always yell when you're shy.

348
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,730
I'm not shy.

349
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,700
Can I and my friends sit with you?

350
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,680
Sure, you can sit here.

351
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,140
Where's Ai?

352
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,240
He's buying me food.

353
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,930
Are you feeling better after getting hit by a basketball yesterday?

354
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,840
It's not much better. It's still bruised.

355
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,080
Get well soon.

356
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,760
Uh... Jida, I have something to ask you.

357
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,040
About me and Ai?

358
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,960
Do you still have feelings for Ai?

359
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,060
Yeah...

360
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,950
I used to have feelings for him.

361
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,040
Ai had no feelings for me and clearly denied my feelings.

362
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,400
Ai said that he already had someone in his heart.

363
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,740
That's bad.

364
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,840
Not that much.

365
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,370
What I want to know is the person in Ai's heart.

366
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,640
Do you know? Ai.

367
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,000
I... I think you shouldn't know about it.

368
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,000
But I think I can guess who the person in Ai's heart is.

369
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,720
So I'll tell you the reason why I approached you.

370
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,920
I want to warn you.

371
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,520
About what?

372
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,420
Jida, don't tease your friends.

373
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,330
I'm going to warn you to button up that shirt,

374
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,500
it shows a kiss mark.

375
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,880
It's a mosquito bite.

376
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,080
That mosquito is so big.

377
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,410
You're so cute when you're shy.

378
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,680
I want to tease you often.

379
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,720
But I think there are jealous mosquito around here.

380
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,160
Talking about mosquito, mosquito fly here.

381
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,800
I think we better go away from here.

382
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
Don't forget to button your shirt.

383
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,790
I won't forget, I'll never forget it for sure.

384
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,840
Isn't it hot?

385
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
It's hot.

386
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,040
If you're hot, just unbutton. I feel uncomfortable for you.

387
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,120
If you feel uncomfortable,

388
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
Don't give me a kiss mark next time.

389
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,080
I saw Jida approaching you just now.

390
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,920
Jida told you? I thought I wouldn't tell it to you.

391
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,200
Aiyaret.

392
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,370
I can't help, I want people to know

393
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,000
That you are mine.
