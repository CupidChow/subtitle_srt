Open the door. Whose car park in front of our house?

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,640
That’s my father.

Open the door.

Good morning Mr. SA.

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,400
About the car that parked in front of our house,

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,830
that’s my boyfriend’s car and my boyfriend is in my room now.

Well, you do not have to be polite.

10

You only show your face. Are you naked?

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
Naked? Normally I don’t wear anything while sleeping

12

if it normal why don’t you open the door.

13

All right, I will take a shower and brush my teeth first.

Yes.

Are you sure?

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,600
You really want to get into relationship with this looney guy.

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Nhai, he like to show off.

27
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,320
He told me that his boyfriend are the best when I heard about it, it make me feel a bit uncomfortable.

28
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
I would like to confess that I was shock,

29
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,800
when Nhai told me that he has a boyfriend.

30
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,520
There’s no sign that he like male,

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,600
because Nhai recently heartbroken from the prom queen

32

Her name is Kan...Kan something.

33

Kanliew.

Oh yes.

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Where’s Nhai now?

36
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,800
He send me the message that he will buy something to eat.

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
And then he just left?

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,680
Yes.

39
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,080
Nhai is that kind of unpredictable and does things instantly.

40
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,840
He is impatient but it has to be his issue.

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,600
Nhai really cares about other people.

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,400
He is always overthinking,

43
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,560
and he can’t solve anything.

44
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,960
In my opinion I think that is the charm of Nhai when he overthinks his face look so cute.

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,520
It seems like you fell in love with my son hard.

When you talk about Nhai you keep smiling.

Seem like you got a good mindset and attitude.

50
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
I didn’t hear you scold me since you know that I am in relationship with Nhai.

51
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,120
Anyway, did you know Singh?

You are about to meet my mum in person, she must be very happy once she meet you.

- Hello mum! This is my boyfriend.
- Hello.

54

- Why! why did you do this to me?
- Mum listen to me.

55

Get out!

56

Ai, you never meet Nhai older brother right?

57
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,760
He is small and has a fair skin.

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,280
I thought he might become homosexual,

59
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,600
and his older brother is closed to Singh.

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,640
6 years ago, I was shocked,

61
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,680
when he said that he made woman pregnant.

62
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,640
Now he has 3 children.

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,400
Between AI and Nhai, it seems normal for me

64
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,800
When I get older, I gain more experience.

65
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,440
Last night Nhai show me his mum picture, I think Nhai look just like his mum.

66
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,920
His older brother looks like you.

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,480
I think the same as you,

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,320
that Nhai will replace his mum

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,240
But I found out that Nhai personality and mum personality are opposite.

70
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,320
Nhai’s mum pass away since he was young. I am the only person who raise him

71
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,120
Nhai is a spoiled kid but he has a good heart.

72
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,560
Please take care of him.

73
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,600
if he lost the way, just pick him up as usual.

74
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,640
And if he forgets his belonging please keep an eyes of him.

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,120
If he finishes his meal, and he doesn’t clean the dish.

76
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,760
- Please do not clean the dish for him, Is that clear?
- Yes.

It was mine. I sent the snack at board-game shop.

That day, we played game and we lost.

151
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,520
The senior punished us by forcing everyone to eat mashed banana.

152
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,600
I am allergic to banana, but no one believed.

153
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:08,920
Suddenly, the person who sit next to me ate all the mashed banana, so I did not have to eat.

154

Okay, I can remember now.

I am terribly sorry. I don’t know what to do, I just want to talk to you.

i got scholarship from university in United state of America, in a few months I have to travel to USA.

165
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,800
So, I intended to meet you. It will be a last time since I might not see you again.

166
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,280
I am so grateful that I have chance to know you.

167
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,560
How long will you study in USA?

168
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,240
Probably 5 to 6 yeas, until I finish doctoral degree.

169
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,920
Good luck Songkwan.

170
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,800
Thank you very much.

171
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,840
I have to go, Jida is waiting for me.

172
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,360
[If there is a chance we will meet again.]

173
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,360
I didn’t say it all, I didn’t tell Intha that I like him.

174
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,520
Why?

175
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,040
I don’t want to be a selfish. If I told him, I would be relieved.

176
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,720
How about Intha? What if he doesn’t feel the same way, it would become a burden for him.

177
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,200
It's okay.

178
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,880
At least you have tried.

179
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,040
I’m sorry.

180
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,720
Not a big deal. Just wash it off.

181
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,000
Should we go to toilet?

182
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,359
Let’s go.

183
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,120
It’s taking forever, if you keep doing like that.

184
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,040
FM, music major year 2.

185
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,040
Hmm? What did you say?

186
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,360
FM, music major year 2.

187
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,720
What?

188
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,240
My name is “FM”, I study music year 2.

189
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,960
Oh. My name is Nine, aerospace engineer year 2 too.

190
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,760
You are the famous one.

191
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,080
What? Am I famous?

192
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,520
Yes. I heard a lot about you.

193
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,720
Well, in the bad way or in the good way.

194
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,940
["D" is pronounced the same as "Good"]

195
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,320
No "D".

196
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,040
What?

197
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,320
Because you got grade A in every subject that’s why they talk about you got no ”D”.

198
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
Is that your joke?

199
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,600
Isn’t that funny?

200
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,640
No!

201
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,440
There you go.

202
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,360
Did you finish?

203
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,400
Gather round everyone. Let's me introduce our faculty.

204
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,800
Our faculty courses are very interesting.

205
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,560
We guarantee that everyone will get a job.

206
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,280
Yes.

207
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm really interested.

208
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
But I don't know if I like it or not.

209
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,720
You are in the right booth.

210
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,680
My friends here will give you further information.

211
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,400
[Ai: Can I come into your room?]

212
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Get up! You’re heavy.

213
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,560
Ai. Stop it. This is not a time.

214
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,520
I am so sleepy, I need to sleep.

215
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,920
I am trying make you stay awake.

216
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,800
Oh!

217
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,240
just go outside, I can’t concentrate if you are here.

218
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
Get out!

219
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,040
Nope.

220
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,280
Get out!

221
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,920
Nope.

222
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,120
Just get out!

223
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,600
- Ai, get out!
- No!

224
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
Get out.

225
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,960
Let me kiss you.

226
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,880
[Chennhai: No No No]

227
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,440
[Ai: I promise that when we read a book,]

228
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,760
[Ai: I will not going to kiss you.]

229
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,080
[Ai: Tonight we just hold hand while sleeping.]

230
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,920
[Ai: Can you open the door for me?]

231
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,880
[Chennhai: You should sleep outside.]

232
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,430
What's wrong with him?

233
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,160
Ai, I am already at the lobby. Is your room on floor 22th? I will see you there.

234
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,000
I am with my boyfriend, I am not available for you.

235
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,000
I want to meet your boyfriend, I am waiting for an elevator.

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
No!

237
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
Why don’t you see me at the lobby?

238
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,560
No.

239
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,720
Elevator is ready.

240
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,800
Your behavior is unacceptable, wait for me downstair. I will see you at the lobby.

241
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
Nhai, I’ll go to lobby and buy something to eat.

242
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,040
Can you buy something for me?

243
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Well, I haven't seen you for 5 years. You are even hotter.

244
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,640
Can I take you a photo and post on my story?

245
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,680
No.

246
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,560
Why? I put on my make up today.

247
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
Stop it!

248
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,400
Mom knew that you came back from Canada, and now you stay in Bangkok.

249
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,880
Mom wants to see you.

250
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,200
She made desserts for you.

251
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,220
But she asked me to give it to you.

252
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,720
Jom.

253
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,440
Please take this desserts to Ai for me.

254
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,250
I miss your brother.

255
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,770
AI won't talk to me at all.

256
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,590
I want to do some good things for him.

257
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,740
Mom, don't worry. I will bring AI to meet you.

258
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,790
Thanks dear.

259
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,480
Take it back.

260
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,000
I don’t understand why you hate Mom this much.

261
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,200
She is your mum, she truly loves you and wants the best for you.

262
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,120
Why can’t you accept her?

263
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,680
Just go back, Jom.

264
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
If you still keep talking about this matter.

265
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,200
I am not okay. It is just a desert.

266
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,360
Can’t you just take it? Me and Mom never asked anything from you.

267
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,560
You do not have to love me and Mom. At least you should accept us as your family.

268
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,640
Family? Never asks for anything? Answer me then.

269
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,160
Isn’t that your life that Mom asked from me?

270
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,400
Why had he been gone for so long?

271
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,360
Hey, Ai forgot his wallet. I'll bring it for him.

272
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Ai.

273
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,680
No, I don't feel anything.

274
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,840
Jom, let go off me.

275
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,600
Ai. You are provoking me. I will get back to you.

276
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,560
Damn!

277
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,760
Just go back, Jom.

278
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
But...

279
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,800
There is no ‘but’.

280
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,680
I don't want to say it, but you came to see me like this.

281
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,380
You have caused me trouble.

282
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,820
And stop bringing me cactus.

283
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,970
It did not work.

284
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,880
Tell your Mom to stop messing with me.

285
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm lonely. I just want to have my brother.

286
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,160
Sorry, but I remember that I was the only child.

287
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,960
This is bad. Nhai must be angry.

288
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,160
Damn it!

289
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,400
What?

290
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,680
Nhai, your jealous is too dramatic!

291
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,640
[30 minutes ago.]

292
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,320
That was a close call.

293
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,120
Ouch!

294
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,720
Ai, you cheated on me, you even set a shoe rack as a trap.

295
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,160
You hurt me, it's okay if I take revenge on you.

296
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,440
You got a cactus from that girl.

297
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,080
You like her, why did you say you like me?

298
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,800
You want to hug her. Why are you hugging me?

299
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,590
It's so hurtful.

300
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,160
Remember it, Aiyaret. Don't make fun with Chen Nhai!

301
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,520
You're bad. You hurt me!

302
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,800
I hate you. You're a traitor. You are unreliable.

303
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,040
You bastard, how could you stay in my room?

304
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,320
You messed up my room.

305
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,920
Get out, my room doesn't welcome a playboy like you.

306
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,200
Will you yell to let everyone know that the husband and wife are arguing?

307
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,970
Who are the husband and wife?

308
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,600
I said I broke up with you, it's over!

309
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,650
Goodbye, Aiyaret.

310
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,200
I lust when I see you.

311
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,400
I'm not breaking up with you!

312
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,080
What will you do?

313
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,440
Make love while explaining.

314
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:22,920
Listen to me. The girl you saw, she is my sister, Jom.

315
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,639
You never told me you have sister.

316
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,719
She is a sister who has a different father with me. Did I ever tell you that I don't have a mother?

317
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,560
She left me since I was born. So I don't want to talk about it.

318
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,520
Please believe me.

319
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,400
Forget about breaking up with me because I'm not breaking up with you.

320
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,740
Okay, I believe you.

321
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,670
I trust people easily.

322
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,040
But... Can you let me go first?

323
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,800
You hugged me so tight that I couldn't breathe.

324
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,720
No, I said I'll make love with you right here.

325
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm just sad because you cheated, you have to ask me to reconcile.

326
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,880
I'll do it if you just pack your bags and leave, not ruining my room like this.

327
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:37,280
I used to think you cheated on me, but I trust you even though you never introduced me to your mother's family.

328
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,880
She is not my family. My family lives in Nan. I'm ready to take you there.

329
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,600
And I'm ready to tell everyone that...I love you.

330
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,440
Sorry, I thought I'd say I love you for the first time in a romantic way.

331
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:11,280
But I've already said that, so... I love you. I love you. I love you.

332
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,920
You should save it for another day.

333
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,760
I love you.

334
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,680
Are you awake?

335
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,520
Let me free. I'm uncomfortable.

336
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,720
Stop it, Ai. Why are you so horny? I'm so tired.

337
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,240
You scold me, it means you're still okay.

338
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,400
But if you have a second round, you can prepare your own funeral.

339
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,720
Oh! I want fish porridge the first night.

340
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,200
And... can you take a shower?

341
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,240
I can, if I crawl there.

342
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,280
Lay here, I'll wipe for you.

343
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,120
Uh, it's cold.

344
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,160
Be patient

345
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,280
After you're done, give me the antipyretic and antipyretic gel.

346
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,720
Why are you sick? Because of me?

347
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,960
No, it's because I ran in the rain from your condo back to the dorm.

348
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,120
I cry all the way, I almost lost my way.

349
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,640
Are you sad because of me that much?

350
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,360
Yeah.

351
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:48,840
I think you're just angry. I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd regret it this much.

352
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,480
You don't need to say anything. I don't want to get hurt again. You are harsh.

353
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,240
I can see that.

354
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Remember, Mr. duck, don't challenge Aiyaret.

355
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,560
Are you sleepwalking?

356
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,840
No, I told myself not to do something stupid. I'm afraid that you will bore me.

357
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:36,800
I like it. Don't overthink it. I can't love you more.

358
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,600
You just tell me what you want, because I can't guess what you think. I also don't want you to bore me

359
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,760
So, please take me to eat Pad Thai.

360
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,960
I'll also give you the greasy grilled shrimp.

361
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm also lucky that I have you.

362
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,640
I like giving you a headache

363
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,880
I have painkillers.

364
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,720
It's definitely an overdose.

365
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,200
I am lucky to have a chance to meet you.

366
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,210
♫ This trip ♫

367
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,310
♫ I think it's worth it and the exhaustion will disappear ♫

368
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:28,320
♫ When I met you ♫

369
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,960
♫ And I know we will meet ♫

370
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,980
♫ and love each other ♫

371
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,970
♫ Where is that person ♫

372
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,760
♫ I'll be waiting for you ♫

373
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,840
♫ Waiting to tell you that ♫

374
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,480
♫ I love you ♫

375
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,720
