2
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,440
I'm faster.

3
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,880
You cheated.

4
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,320
Why don't you bite faster.

5
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,280
You just say who eats it first wins.

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,720
Thank you so much, Jida

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,000
But you don't have to.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
It's fine.

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,039
I want Ai to have it.

10
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
I was in the queue for you.

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,400
Thanks anyway.

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,720
I have to go.

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,120
My friend is waiting.

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Ai, have a good time.

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Jida, what are you talking with him?

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
Tell me.

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
I don't want to.

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
Tell me now, Jida.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,680
Why would you want to know?

20
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,360
I want to be nosy about my friend.

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
You are too nosy.

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
You don't want to know?

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,520
Enough.

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,160
Don't argue

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,920
about that.

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
There is nothing much.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Just bring the snack for him,

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,760
and told him I was in the queue for him.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Did you say you like him?

30
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,280
Are you crazy! Who would do that? Ai's friends sat there.

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,840
So if Ai's friends isn't there, you will tell him that you like him, right?

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,040
I still can't.

33
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,240
Such a pity. If you're slow like this, I guarantee that you won't get him.

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,720
We can go slow and steady.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
No! Jida.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,360
Next time you must get his number.

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,880
Don't encourage her too much.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,160
I think if Jida is this slow. Ducky (Chen Nhai) will got him first.

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
Look there.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,400
I see.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Nhai.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Jida brought it for Ai.

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,920
Ai hasn't even eat yet.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,760
You don't want to share your snack with me?

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,280
You can eat it, I've eaten this before

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,079
while you keep complaining.

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
You often get free mystery snacks.

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,079
Don't try to talk like that.

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,640
Until now you still don't know who gave these to you.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Even I don't know who gave it to me but I know it's for me.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,680
I can eat it, not like you who eat other snacks.

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,480
This does not belong to others.

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
It belongs to Ai.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,120
Enough, first the two of you stop argue with each other.

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Fine.

56
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,160
Because you said so.

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,280
Then let's eat BBQ pork this evening.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah I want to eat that.

59
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
Can a foreign student like you eat that?

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,600
I don't know.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,960
But I've seen the Thai BBQ pork restaurant.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
There’s no air-conditioned room.

63
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Will he be able to endure the heat?

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,040
Oh, good at being nosy since after you wear neat clothes every day.

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,240
You seem to get angry easily, Mr. Chennhai.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,880
Again?

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,440
What?

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,400
Why are you iron these clothes for me?

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,320
See?

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,320
It's too neat.

71
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
I already did it.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,960
What are you complaining for?

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I don't like it.

74
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
It's not cool.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't understand.

76
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,640
What?

77
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,840
Nhai.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,080
If you can't wear that neat shirt then you don't have to wear any.

79
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,120
Wait.

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,080
Ai.

81
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,160
What are you doing?

82
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Ai.

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,480
Ai.

84
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,680
Ai.

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,040
Yeah.

86
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Are you coming with or going home?

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,960
I'll go with you guys, I can go home tomorrow.

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,280
Are you going home?

89
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Yeah.

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,760
Ok.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,640
Should we go now. Ton, I'm going with your car today.

92
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
Why do you go with me today?

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
Normally you go with Ai.

94
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,640
Are you guys mad at each other? No, I should ask,

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,120
are you mad at Ai?

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,680
Shut up, Intra.

97
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,640
Your face tells it all.

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
You look

99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
and keep looking.

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,440
He didn't made up to you, did he?

101
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,240
So you've got mad.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,000
You bad friends.

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
You're mad.

104
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,760
Because you're upset with me?

105
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
What's are you upset about?

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,800
So I can made up to you.

107
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Or

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,480
this is about what I did?

109
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Ai.

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,480
Look at what you have done.

111
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,080
Look at this.

112
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,200
You did this.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,360
Yeah?

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,760
So what?

115
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
How am I supposed to go to college?

116
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
You made this very visible.

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,800
Enough talk.

118
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,240
Or we are going to be late.

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
Shut up Aiyaret.

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,280
If you want me to be quiet.

121
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Stop being mad at me.

122
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,520
How about it?

123
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,360
I will treat you pork BBQ, ok?

124
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Do you think food will make me happy?

125
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,080
Aiyaret.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Where are you going?

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,800
To go wait in the car.

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,720
You said it.

129
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,000
That you will treat me.

130
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,320
If you want me to treat you.

131
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
You have to get in my car.

132
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
Not Ton's car.

133
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,680
Fine...I know.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,880
Let's meet at the BBQ restaurant at 5 in the evening.

135
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
Why in such a hurry? It's 5 PM, I'm not hungry yet.

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,760
In conclusion.

137
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Meet at 7 p.m, OK?

138
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,040
Yeah.

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,600
Intra.

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,640
Nine.

141
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Is it clear?

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,440
Ok.

143
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,920
Let's go have pork BBQ.

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,080
Let's go. You need to relax a bit since I saw you tutoring in Bangkok non stop.

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,480
You are not going anywhere. I only see you at school and accommodation.

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,800
I travel for a long distance, I need to study hard.

147
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,480
Let's go. It's not delicious if you eat BBQ pork alone.

148
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,080
Fine.

149
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Yeah.

150
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,640
Why didn't you tell me that you will go home?

151
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm not going back today I'll go tomorrow.

152
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,280
That's it.

153
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,799
If I am not busy.

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,799
I'll go home every weekend.

155
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,320
You never mention that.

156
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,880
Don't tell me.

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,840
You're mad about this?

158
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,880
No.

159
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,840
That's not true, your face said it all.

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,880
Aiyaret.

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,680
I'm not upset with you because of this little thing, Chen Nhai.

162
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,520
Because even if I am mad, you won't do anything to make me feel better anyway.

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
Your hair is long.

164
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Go get your hair cut.

165
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,720
Fine.

166
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,800
I will.

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,360
Where is it?

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
What are you looking for?

169
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,560
Por Sip's headband.

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,440
Usually I have it in car.

171
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,240
It's okay.

172
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,040
I have this.

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,480
You like keeping weird stuffs.

174
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,400
Look at me.

175
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,200
What?

176
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,440
Confused?

177
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,920
Thank you.

178
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't act cute.

179
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,480
Or you don't get to eat BBQ pork.

180
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,720
How are you going home tomorrow? You want me to go with you?

181
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Don't worry about me getting lost.

182
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Who would get lost on his way home?

183
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,280
I'm not worried about that.

184
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,320
I just want to meet your father and introduce myself.

185
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
You can't meet my father, OK?.

186
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,120
Have you ever seen big knife for chopping chicken?

187
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,920
That make a loud scary noise.

188
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,200
If my dad finds out you threatened me. Dad will slaughter you for sure.

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,880
Thanks for the info.

190
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
What info?

191
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,080
Info for making decision.

192
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,080
Should I ask your father conscientiously.

193
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
or should I kidnap you and runaway,

194
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,600
Huh?

195
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,280
But I guess. I better kidnap you.

196
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
Who's going with you?

197
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,280
What?

198
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,920
What with him?

199
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,240
Ai.

200
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,360
This way.

201
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,640
Ton.

202
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,480
Too noisy, show some respect for others.

203
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,160
Please sit down first.

204
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Is this your first time? The restaurant has a special promotion for you.

205
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,960
What's promotion?

206
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,240
Aiyares pay for everyone!

207
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,280
What are you waiting for, clap your hands.

208
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,800
I think we should choose this table.

209
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,000
I think this table is better go on, sit down.

210
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,120
Did you know? eating grilled pork is a competition.

211
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,560
What did you just said?

212
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,840
I can't hear you clearly.

213
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah.

214
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,120
This.

215
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,880
Look at my yellow duck. Ai took it to fix the hook to make it new, cool, isn't it?.

216
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,320
Be careful not to drop it.

217
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,760
It will become a grilled duck.

218
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm not dropping it.

219
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
Oh really?

220
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
A guy like you

221
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,520
likes to drop things all over.

222
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,640
Enough stop arguing.

223
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Why don't you pick up the phone?

224
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,400
Is someone coming to deliver the parcel?

225
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,120
Who would deliver parcels at 8pm?

226
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,280
Are you nuts?

227
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,200
Hello.

228
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
Hey guys, I'll be right back.

229
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm going to talk for a while.

230
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,720
It's all gone can't help it.

231
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,720
I want it, I want it.

232
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,720
Who is that?

233
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Did you know who’s that?

234
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,320
No, I don’t know that person?

235
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
If I know them, I might say hi.

236
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,720
But I've seen you look at that table many times.

237
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,400
He looks like someone I know.

238
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,360
Just eat this, it all cooked.

239
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,400
What? It's empty again?

240
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,520
Chon, you go get some more pork.

241
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,760
Me?

242
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah you, I just wait. Bring a lot of bacon too.

243
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,720
Fine.

244
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Hey guys, Does any of you want anything? I'll go get some more.

245
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,520
I'll go.

246
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Hey it's okay.

247
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,160
I'll go. Sit down.

248
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,560
Fine.

249
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
He's weirdly kind today.

250
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,119
Yeah.

251
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,920
Hey bacon are all gone.

252
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,640
I'll ask Nhai to get more.

253
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,320
Excuse me, all the sausages fall.

254
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,000
Thanks.

255
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,680
Nhai.

256
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,560
Give me some bacon.

257
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Sure.

258
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,480
Leave it to me.

259
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,120
Get a lot of bacon.

260
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,680
As you wish.

261
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,800
Hey!

262
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,360
Why are you sitting there?

263
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,320
Oh... I dropped my chopsticks.

264
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Just get a new one. The one that drooped is no longer needed.

265
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:39,920
Thanks.

266
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah.

267
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,160
Yes.

268
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,040
Thanks.

269
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,200
Who is he talking to?

270
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,040
It's taking too long.

271
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,600
Why Ai talking on the phone for so long?

272
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,360
Right. Who is it talking to?

273
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,480
I heard the voice.

274
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,560
Female voice.

275
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,080
So cute.

276
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,440
Ai is a real playboy.

277
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,680
I doubt he will get a girlfriend soon.

278
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,560
Nhai.

279
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,400
Did you know that who is he talking to?

280
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,040
You know?

281
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,320
Please let me know.

282
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,560
I just saw him talking to a girl for the first time.

283
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,000
Along with you guys.

284
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
And who is he talking to?

285
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,800
Why should I care?

286
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
None of my business.

287
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,480
It is.

288
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,120
You and Ai are close to each other like twins.

289
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,000
If Ai runs away and has a new girlfriend. You will die for sure.

290
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
So be it.

291
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's eat.

292
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Ton.

293
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Pass me the sausage dish.

294
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,080
Spicy.

295
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,480
I bit on chili.

296
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,320
Clumsy.

297
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Don't.

298
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
You!

299
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,160
Keep quiet, others will know.

300
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,440
Oh, did you drink all of my liquor.

301
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
It's all gone.

302
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,880
Nhai.

303
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,080
What's the most delicious today?

304
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,360
Sausages.

305
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,200
Very delicious.

306
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,600
I need permission,

307
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,720
to get the sausages out first.

308
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,560
Otherwise Sink in your pocket for sure.

309
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,760
I just drink a liquor.

310
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,400
You are not a good drinker.

311
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,040
I won't take more than ten minutes.

312
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm not drunk.

313
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,120
Enough.

314
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Just keep this with me.

315
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,720
Ton, did you bring a little more?

316
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,520
Ton, do you have some more liquor?

317
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,600
No, not anymore.

318
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,080
Why is he like this?

319
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,360
Is he drunk?

320
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
Yeah.

321
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
I snuck this in.

322
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,560
He drank all of this at once.

323
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,720
so he is like this.

324
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
Normally two glasses and he drunk.

325
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Nhai eat sausages dipped in sauce.

326
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,760
This time he bit the chili. Wherever the water is he picks it up and drink it all.

327
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,080
Enough with your sausage.

328
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,600
You don't have to act like you are sober.

329
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,000
I know you.

330
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,400
How long have you been friends with me?

331
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,800
And sleep in my room tonight.

332
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,360
You can't take care of yourself alone.

333
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,640
No way, I'm going to sleep in Ai's room.

334
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,880
The bed is soft, the air conditioner is cool, the wi-fi is free.

335
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,360
Let's go back.

336
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,000
Nhai can sleep with me.

337
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,920
Are you sure?

338
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,080
Yeah.

339
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
Let's go.

340
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,800
Ai.

341
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,920
I'll take the sausage back to eat later.

342
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
But these guys

343
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
won't let me.

344
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,920
Yeah, I'll go buy a new one.

345
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,280
No.

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,840
It's not as tasty as here.

347
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
How do I get it back?

348
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,680
In this bag.

349
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,040
Restaurant owner won't see it.

350
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,240
Hurry up.

351
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,960
Or someone will see.

352
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,400
Fine.

353
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,640
Ton.

354
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,600
Give me a plate of sausage.

355
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,560
Hurry up, people will see.

356
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,400
Let's go back.

357
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Hey, see you guys later.

358
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,360
Bye, drive safely.

359
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,160
Are you okay?

360
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,920
Yeah.

361
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,840
Ai.

362
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,600
Sausages.

363
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,080
Sausages.

364
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,680
Let's go home together.

365
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,640
Ai.

366
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
Careful if he try to kiss you.

367
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,160
If he does, you can kick him.

368
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,160
Yeah.

369
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,080
I'll kick him.

370
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah.

371
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,960
See you tomorrow.

372
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,000
Take care of him.

373
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,920
Don't worry.

374
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,360
See you and drive safely.

375
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,600
Let's get in the car.

376
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,840
Will he be fine?

377
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,360
I don't know.

378
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,200
Who would dare to kick you down?

379
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,960
I want to kiss you so bad.

380
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,520
Drunken Duck.

381
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,240
Sleep well.

382
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,960
Your head..It smells like burning pork.

383
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,240
But your smell is so good.

384
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,120
Smells like BBQ pork.

385
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,480
Beer too.

386
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,680
Yeah...

387
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
Your arm is heavy.

388
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,760
Get it out.

389
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Ton said you're stressed.

390
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,480
What are you stressing about?

391
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,600
Or because you're with me.

392
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,280
You're not happy.

393
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,120
That's not it.

394
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Staying with you make me so happy.

395
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
but I'm mad at you.

396
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,720
About the love mark on my neck.

397
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,640
Bruised.

398
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,800
See?

399
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm in love with you.

400
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,480
You're making me want to bite you more, you know?

401
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm more mad at you.

402
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,240
I seduce you,

403
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
then you don't care about me.

404
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,920
Huh?

405
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,040
You're flirting with me?

406
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,320
Um

407
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,240
I seduced you.

408
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,040
I seduced you in the kitchen every morning.

409
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,960
And you don't care.

410
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,240
If I attack first.

411
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,560
It'll be too obvious.

412
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,440
Be Chennai, it's embarrassing.

413
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,640
Did you know Aiyares?

414
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,640
I know you're mad at me for doing that.

415
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,480
And you don't want me to touch you again.

416
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,520
What am I angry about?

417
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,920
I like it.

418
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,800
Your mouth,

419
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,120
me and you

420
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,640
are not in a clear relationship.

421
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,520
I want it,

422
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,520
but I can't make it too obvious, can I?

423
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,240
Nhai.

424
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,280
You like me to do it.

425
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,480
You don't have too.

426
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,800
Today you just stay still.

427
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
I'll do the rest.

428
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,240
I will copy-paste every position.

429
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Until the last position.

430
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,000
You will know how good it is.

431
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,920
You can't blame me.

432
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,320
If you want me to do it again.

433
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,240
Wait.

434
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,840
What can I do with him?

435
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,520
Ow why did you bite me? Ai.

436
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,600
Wait.

437
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,120
What's wrong Nhai?

438
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,280
Do you feel better?

What have you done?

462

I guess.

463
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,080
If you wake up you might not want to meet my face.

464
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,040
Or doing something out of character.

465
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,520
It's definitely last a week.

Nah.

OMG, everyone look so handsome.

472
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,760
Beauty, you are here to cheer the athletes not here to look at handsome guys.

473
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,440
Wow, but they are really handsome.

474
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,719
You mentioned that you are not here for a handsome guy?

475
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,239
That right.

476
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,920
You girls are same.

477
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,920
You staring at Ai like that. You must be lonely. He won't play with you.

478
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,280
Just leave him alone, he said it is way too hot here, let him just sit there.

Jida,, why did you stop?

482
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Is it good or not? I am not brave enough.

483
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Well, if you hesitate then you won't get a boyfriend. Go on he's waiting there.

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,280
♫ Where is the person ♫

512
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
♫ I'm looking for ♫

513
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,280
♫ The person that I'm looking for ♫

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,280
♫ We will meet someday ♫
