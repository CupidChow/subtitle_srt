4
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,259
Ai. Are you Ai?

5
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,640
Yes.

6
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,340
You don't need to be afraid of me. Are you waiting for Sib?

7
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,900
Do you know my father?

8
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,979
I know your father, I know Jaonan as well.

9
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,940
Shall we find somewhere to talk?

10
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,260
Do you want to tell me something?

11
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,259
I'm your biological mother.

12
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm thinking about inviting you to dinner in the evening.

13
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,220
Where have you been?

14
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,820
I picked you up from school but couldn't find you.

15
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,980
If you hang out with friends you must tell me first.

16
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,380
Didn't you say my mom is dead?

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,260
What did you just say? Ai.

18
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm talking about my mom. Mom is at the front of the house now.

19
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,460
Mother, the person you've left.

20
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,780
Why are you lying to me?

21
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,820
How did you leave your family to be with Jaonan?

22
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,660
Aiyaret.

23
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,380
Why are you lying to me?

24
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,700
What did I lie to you?

25
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,300
About your mother's death or what?

26
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,900
That you took my father from my mother.

27
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,540
You want to have children but you can't, so you took me from my mother.

28
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,470
And you lied about my mother's death.

29
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,940
The most cunning person is Jaonan.

30
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,380
Ai.

31
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,420
You must apologize to Jaonan now.

32
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,500
Hurry up.

33
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,220
Did Rajin tell you that?

34
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm the one who has raised you.

35
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,900
Do I seem to be such a bad person?

36
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:16,899
Ai.

37
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,100
I heard that she remarried to a diplomat, she had a completely new life.

38
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,100
But her trait was as disgusting as ever.

39
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,500
Deceitfully. Inveigle.

40
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,380
She dared to step on our area, messing with our people.

41
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,460
Be careful, she's not going to die beautifully.

42
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,100
Are you going to hurt my mother the way you used to hurt my mother when she almost miscarried me?

43
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:11,180
You don't have to be nice to me if you ever wanted to kill me.

44
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,940
Disgusting.

45
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,500
Ai. Stop.

46
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,980
Don't you love me, Dad? Or do you love Jaonan that much?

47
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,700
So you made everything happen like this.

48
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,220
It's not a child's problem.

49
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,860
When will I be old enough?

50
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,740
Enough for you to tell me everything. Or that day never comes?

51
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,060
That's enough, stop now,

52
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,420
please.

53
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,900
If what I and Sib have always been doing for you is meaningless, then go!

54
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,220
Just choose, what kind of identity you want to be.

55
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,620
The identity you created for me is a fake.

56
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,500
I don't want it.

57
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,500
Arrogance. Egoism.

58
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,980
I hope you are happy with what you have taken.

59
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,660
You're an ungrateful person. Don't be ignominious and return here.

60
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,300
Are you okay?

61
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,740
Yes.

62
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,180
I heard Jaonan was mean to you.

63
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,380
Is Jaonan always yelling at you?

64
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:18,420
I'm afraid that Jaonan was mean to you because of the hate he has for me.

65
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,420
No. Never. Mostly, my father will scold me.

66
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,480
Really? Are you hungry?

67
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,100
No, but if you're hungry you can eat

68
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,180
You called me formally.

69
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,380
Is it better to call me Mom? Try to call me that.

70
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,180
Yes, Mom.

71
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,780
If you're not hungry, then let's go to the hospital.

72
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,740
Why?

73
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,780
I have a daughter named Jom Kwan.

74
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,100
She has leukemia.

75
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,500
I don’t understand.

76
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,060
You'll understand when you get there.

77
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,660
Ai.

78
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,820
Do you know why I brought you here to see your sister?

79
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,940
I don't know.

80
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,500
I want you guys to get to know each other

81
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,820
so that you can have a friend in Bangkok and not be lonely.

82
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,620
Yes, Mom.

83
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,500
But… but there is something more important.

84
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,020
What is it?

85
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,340
Uh, I need your bone marrow to help your sister.

86
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,460
Huh? What did you say?

87
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,380
Hello.

88
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,620
He is Jom Kwan's father.

89
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,100
He was upset to find out later that I had a child before.

90
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Is that my sister?

91
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,740
Mom, is that Ai?

92
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,740
That you used to tell me.

93
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,540
Yes, sweetie. He will help you.

94
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,820
He's already promised me.

95
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,820
Ai, come here. Let's talk to your sister.

96
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,500
You two have a chat. I have to talk to my husband.

97
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,260
How long have you stayed here?

98
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,900
I've been in and out here for almost a year.

99
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,700
But I have been admitted seriously for only two months.

100
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,900
Does that mean you didn't go to school?

101
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,780
How can I go? I hurt my whole body.

102
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:59,540
It hurts even to breathe, but I want to go. I want to play with my friends.

103
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,260
Ai.

104
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,860
Huh?

105
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,740
Can you really help me?

106
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,420
I don’t know.

107
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,300
You definitely can, Mom doesn't lie to us.

108
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,740
This plant is my friend.

109
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I give it to you because now I have a brother.

110
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,980
I don't need to talk to a plant anymore.

111
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,740
Is it a cactus?

112
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,780
Yes. Nice to meet you, my brother.

113
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,420
Where is my phone?

114
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,580
Or is it at home?

115
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,500
Forget it. I don't know if Dad is still angry when I call him.

116
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Where is Mom?

117
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,460
Your face looks happy when you see your ex-husband.

118
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,540
Hey.

119
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,940
That's my mom's voice.

120
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,860
Your face looks happy because I could deceive that brat.

121
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,220
One more thing, I can get my revenge on that douchebag too.

122
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,430
He was eventually betrayed.

123
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,140
Now he must be angry that he raised his treacherous son.

124
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Don't say that he can help us now.

125
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,980
We still don't know if his cells will be able to transplant into our daughter's cells.

126
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,580
What if his cells can't be transplanted with our daughter?

127
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,140
He is your son, not me.

128
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,260
Don't bring him into my house!

129
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,700
My son, I can raise him.

130
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,820
You can? But don't take my money.

131
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,500
Do you think Sib will let his son suffer?

132
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,140
He loves his son. I just called once and he quickly transferred the money to me.

133
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,660
Sib is a kind person,

134
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,780
not as bad as you.

135
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,660
Bad?

136
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:43,100
A bad girl like you deserves a bad guy like me.

137
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,700
If Sib had any feelings for me, I wouldn't have ended up with you.

138
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,540
The reason you don't like Jaonan isn't just because of that kid, right?

139
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,100
It's probably because Sibpakorn gave his life to Jaonan instead of you.

140
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,020
Shut up.

141
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,940
Why do you deceive me?

142
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,740
Hey, stop. You brat.

143
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,820
Ai.

144
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Hmm?

145
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,140
My mom said our cells could be transplanted.

146
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,860
Yes

147
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,340
Are you afraid?

148
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,860
Why?

149
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,099
The doctor will pierce your back.

150
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,060
I don't need to be afraid.

151
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,220
But...I'm afraid it will hurt.

152
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,700
Just choose between pain and death.

153
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,260
When you're recovering, let's plant some cacti together.

154
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Plant it all over the house.

155
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,100
Okay.

156
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,900
It's time now.

157
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,580
You gave me life, today I give back to your daughter.

158
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,060
It is recompense, we no longer owe each other anymore.

159
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,620
I miss my dad and Jaonan.

160
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,780
Excuse me, can I borrow your phone?

161
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,540
I'm not surprised.

162
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,420
Excuse me, can I borrow your phone?

163
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,740
I'm lost and don't have a phone, I want to borrow your phone to call my family.

164
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,780
Dad.

165
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,380
Ai.

166
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,700
Can you pick me up? I want to be back home.

167
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,500
Where are you?

168
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,260
I'm in front of the alley where you took Jaonan and me to dinner last time when we came to Bangkok.

169
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,100
Are you really coming to pick me up?

170
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,100
Don't go anywhere, stay there.

171
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,380
OK.

172
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,540
Thank you.

173
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,660
Ai.

174
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,340
Dad.

175
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
I’m sorry, dad.

176
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,500
It’s okay, God bless you.

177
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,060
Why did you arrive so early? From Nan to here it takes several hours.

178
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,820
I came to Bangkok the same day as you.

179
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,340
I was going to take you home.

180
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,580
I told Jaonan not to stop me when I spank you.

181
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,460
Do it. It's my fault.

182
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,020
I've dropped that thought since I couldn't find you.

183
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,980
Rajin didn't tell me where she hid you.

184
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,420
Jaonan goes on a rampage at the diplomat's house. It was a mess.

185
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,780
I couldn't find you until you called me.

186
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,780
Jaonan is here too?

187
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,220
Jaonan, I’m sorry.

188
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,260
It’s my bad. I’m a bad kid. I’m sorry.

189
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,380
If you disgust me, don't pay respect to me. Just pay respect to your beloved mother.

190
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,980
I’m sorry, Jaonan.

191
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,580
However, the past cannot be corrected.

192
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,780
I didn't take good care of you, so you left me?

193
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:15,980
You can say I ask for a debt of your gratitude but what you did is ungrateful.

194
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,700
I'm a gullible person. I trust her more than you.

195
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,500
Jaonan, she deceived me. She just needed my bone marrow

196
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,340
to save her daughter's life. I shouldn't have loved her. I love you.

197
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,380
I love Jaonan and dad.

198
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,180
What disease does her daughter have?

199
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Leukemia.

200
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,340
She needs my bone marrow.

201
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,260
Have you already given it to her?

202
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,500
Yes.

203
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,340
I've raised him without making him feel difficult. How dare they do such a bad thing to our people?

204
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,350
Sib. Take Ai to the hospital before he dies before seeing their destruction.

205
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,620
[Present Day]

206
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,560
Who has cleaned the room?

207
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,500
Where has the washing machine gone?

208
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,460
I hired a maid, I was lazy. I took the washing machine for repairs.

209
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:09,420
It's broken? I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

210
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,780
You paid for the repair last night or do you want to pay again?

211
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,820
No! I can’t do it anymore.

212
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,340
You bit me. Are you hungry?

213
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:47,500
You always bite me. I just want to know what it feels like to bite someone.

214
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,660
And how does it feel?

215
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,100
It's salty.

216
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:10,500
Hey, why is that room open? I've never seen it open before.

217
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,260
I have the maid clean up. Nan's old room.

218
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,140
It's for keeping my father's books and musical instruments.

219
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,300
My father said he had many memories with Nan.

220
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:34,940
Wait, they're siblings, right? Because your grandmother remarried Nan's father.

221
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:44,380
If the order of relatives, yes. But what siblings have tattooed each other names in the middle of their backs?

222
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,380
My father tattooed "Nankhao" in the middle of his back.

223
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:50,920
Huh?

224
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,660
Is he like you and me?

225
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,820
Like what?

226
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,540
Like being in love.

227
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,260
What kind of love?

228
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,580
Something like a couple.

229
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:15,260
I didn’t mean Dad and Nan, but I mean you. In what way do you love me? And how much do you love me?

230
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,260
I think… I need to go check that room.

231
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,180
Why is there a Thai fiddle here? The others are all international instruments.

232
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:15,940
Nan has told me that when you love someone you should play fiddle for him. I will play one song for you.

233
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,580
For me? It’s kinda weird though.

234
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,300
So? Am I cool?

235
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,820
Mmm.

236
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,220
Reward me.

237
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,980
Can you play all kinds of instruments?

238
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,620
Not all. But I know how to play every piece here.

239
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,780
I’m good at Piano. Do you wanna hear it?

240
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,380
Can you play while you are still holding my hand?

241
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,700
Just do it like this.

242
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,780
See, I can play.

243
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,860
I asked my dad to study music when I was young. But he didn't allow it.

244
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,940
He took me to swim class, riding a horse, Taekwondo, and boxing.

245
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,220
Well, you seem suitable for something that requires muscle.

246
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,940
You're not picking at me, are you?

247
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:50,820
I’m giving you a compliment! But if you wanna learn, I can teach, just try to call me Professor Ai.

248
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,180
Ew, Professor Ai. This gave me goosebumps.

249
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,080
Just play it.

250
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,660
I played this song often when I was in Canada.

251
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,620
For whom?

252
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,780
For my loneliness self.

253
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,580
Hubby, I’m here if you need me.

254
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,340
Let me give you a squeeze!

255
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,220
Why do you like to hurt me?

256
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,380
Ai.

257
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Who is it?

258
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,660
I’m with you. How could I know that?

259
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,940
Ai.

260
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,700
This is Jom.

261
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,700
Nhai, don’t open!

262
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:56,180
Your sis looks like you. She dresses like a goddess doll.

263
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,260
Do you ever play with a Barbie doll? This is called Barbie, not a goddess doll!

264
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,700
Really?

265
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,460
I told Jom not to come here.

266
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,380
You don’t have to worry!

267
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,300
Are you Jom? I’m Nhai.

268
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,820
Nhai.

269
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,659
What's wrong?

270
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,860
Nothing.

271
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,580
Then should we let her in?

272
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,699
I don’t so.

273
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,780
Why are you here, Jom Kwan?

274
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,020
I have something to consult with you.

275
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,380
Hub, take it easy.

276
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,260
Go home now, your mom must be worried about you.

277
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,620
No, I don’t, if you don’t talk with me.

278
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,980
Go home.

279
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,620
I think you better wait at that place downstairs.

280
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,860
We will join you later.

281
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,100
Come here.

282
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,020
My house always has a conflict with that house,

283
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,620
and I promised Nan that I won’t be involved with them.

284
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,900
How many things I still don't know about you?

285
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,940
About four or five years ago, I found out that my mom was still alive,

286
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,900
and she made me fight with my family.

287
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:50,140
When everything ended, I cut ties with my mom. But Jom has been trying to reconcile me with Mom.

288
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:56,220
But it shouldn't be that way. Is it my fault? Why do I have to care about the person who doesn't love me?

289
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,700
I get it, you don't have to say it anymore. I don't like drama.

290
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,740
But no matter what happens, I will always be with you.

291
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,060
Thanks.

292
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,340
It’s okay. I will tell her to go home because you're not comfortable talking.

293
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,700
And...

294
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,740
Do you want some difficult postures?

295
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,140
If you do that now, we won't have dinner.

296
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,220
I shouldn’t sympathize with you, Ai.

297
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,580
Where’s Ai? He won’t come down here?

298
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,580
He’s busy.

299
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,890
Have a sit.

300
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,860
Hi.

301
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:29,340
I’m Rajin, Aiyaret’s mother. Ai won’t come down here? Then could you give him these dumplings?

302
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,500
Yes.

303
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,380
What’s your name? Jom told me you are Nai...

304
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,380
It’s Nhai, Chen Nhai.

305
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,300
You look a lot like JaoNan. I was surprised when you approached, thinking you were him.

306
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,820
But when I looked at you closely, I realized you're not him.

307
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,180
Yes, Ai told me that too.

308
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,540
What’s your relationship with my son? You're staying in the same room.

309
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,580
I doubt that you are just normal friends.

310
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,900
Is that all? Can I go back to my room then?

311
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,700
It's an exam period so I have to study.

312
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,740
I command you to break up with Aiyaret.
