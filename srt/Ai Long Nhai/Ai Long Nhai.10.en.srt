1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,160
You are in the same room.

2
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,680
I doubt that you are just normal friend.

3
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,320
Is that all? Then can I go back to my room?

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,120
I have an exam, so I will have to take some study.

5
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,960
I told you to break up with Aiyaret.

6
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,680
I won’t.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,479
I knew that you will answer me like this.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,320
I shouldn’t let Sib raise him.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,600
Living in the house of those wrong gender, so Ai be like this.

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,640
I’m think I can’t take these food. I will place it right here.

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,840
Let me go. It hurt!

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,440
Even if you refused, you have to break up. I will take my son back anyway.

13
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,800
And I will let him marry the girl I find for him. . You know why?

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,200
Because he is not the real Sib’s son, he’s just an illegitimate child.

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,480
Just think, when that house isn’t accepted Ai anymore. Who will be left for him? who will be by his side?

16
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,720
I introduce that girl to Ai when we are in Canada.

17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:02,440
They match each other. I loved Ai and try to give him what was good for him.

18
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Ai don’t know this right? That him isn’t Sib’s son.

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,920
Yes, he doesn’t. And I won’t tell him

20
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,079
It should be like that. Because when you told that to anyone.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
It’s show how promiscuity you are.

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,120
Do you think he will let Ai be with you? He's more attached to him than you that leaving him.

23
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,079
How earthworms like you dare to teach me?

24
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,520
Just saying nicely, don't make me think you're more of a disrespectful adult.

25
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Mom!!!

26
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Besides, tell your daughter that she is a woman. Don't knock on the men's room.

27
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:12,120
Usually I don't mess with anyone first, but you start. And if you mess with me again. You will be humiliated more than this.

28
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,880
why do you do to me

29
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,080
How dare you? If you do anything to me, I will shout that you bullied me and my daughter.

30
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,800
I definitely know the bully on social media better than you.

31
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
I definitely don't do anything that troubles myself.

32
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,960
Besides, my sincere condolences that you have a male daughter-in-law.

33
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,840
Why has Nhai been gone for so long?

34
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,000
Why?

35
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,520
Where are you?

36
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,360
The park around there? Wait there. I'll be there.

37
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
Wait me there I will be right back.

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
Well, don’t forget to bring the medicine for the wound.

39
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,760
Hmm, where did you get the wound!?

40
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
That’s fine, just let it go.

41
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
So you already met my mom right?

42
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,840
Already, hurry up! Don’t ask too much.

43
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Hey! That’s Ai.

44
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,080
Ouchhh!

45
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,120
Nhai, it hurts!

46
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
Real headshot.

47
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
Are you still playing around?

48
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,960
what did my mom talk to you about?

49
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Damn, it was amazing. Your disastrous mom.

50
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,200
Do you know that your mon doesn’t like me. The worst is I don't like your mom either!

51
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,320
Hey! Nhai.

52
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,800
Let’s go find some seats and talk.

53
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Anyway, how do you know your mom come

54
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,920
I saw you were down for a while, so I came to find you,

55
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,120
and I suddenly found her and Jom were getting in the car. And I can’t find you, so I immediately hit you up.

56
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,799
I don’t want to snitch you about it, but your mom fucking insists to me that she doesn’t like me.

57
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,240
Did you hurt?

58
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:50,120
Nah, my pain glands are deep. But the mother-in-law problem.

59
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:58,200
It’s a big deal for couple life, she told me to break up with you.

60
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
What did you answer?

61
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,800
I told her I won’t do. She was furious with dad and Nan as well

62
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:16,920
but I already planned when I go to Nan I would kiss your father’s ass. See three people, how I’m not gonna win over mom!

63
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,160
Nahh, it’s four, including me. I will tell her to come and say sorry to you.

64
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:34,040
Your mom? You don’t need to. She will think that I tease her. Let me just snitch that with you.

65
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Actually, she bought you dumpling,

66
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:11,040
but I had it all, it was so tasty, but I have known a place that more delicious. I will buy you later.

67
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,560
Stingy like you, I don’t wish.

68
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,600
To fight with mother in law, it needs some invest.

69
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,200
Are you accepted that you are wife?

70
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,280
Fine I’m wife. Are you feeling good enough?

71
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,360
How come I ended up having a crush with a person like you? Nhai

72
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,480
Too late to change your mind!

73
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:47,400
I won’t! I never thought how it’s gonna be if we broke up, I only think how it would be if we both get old together.

74
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,000
Stop it because a handsome person will always last! Wait,

75
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,480
AI

76
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,640
you made a promise with Nan, right? That you will not mess around with mom.

77
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes

78
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,760
You just keep your words. About your mom

79
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:21,120
I will handle it. As far as I know, Nan seems to have the most authority, so I’m on Nan’s side.

80
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,120
You are right.

81
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,360
Because I’m smart. And now you can stop holding me,

82
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,800
I’m thirsty, I was eating dumplings way too much.

83
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
At the condo has some.

84
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,920
I want to buy at auntie’s shop.

85
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:51,360
Hmm, it’s too far. Also, it is hard to find the parking lots.

86
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,320
It’s fine. I will ride the scooter by myself, I’m in the mood for Pipo fermented milk with an energy shake.

87
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,160
Alright I will ride it then. Hold me tight!

88
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,640
So you're gonna have an energy drink because tonight's going to be a difficult pose?

89
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,720
Hell, no! I have to read books for the exam tomorrow.

90
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:30,760
Oh, yes, I forgot, then let’s get two glass of it. I haven’t read any as well.

91
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,360
Give me a key.

92
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,520
You sure you can ride?

93
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,720
Yeah I can. Don’t you trust me?

94
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,520
Ready? Hold me tight, so you aren’t gonna fall off.

95
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
Yes, finally done with the test!!

96
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Why don't you take care of it? It has become black.

97
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,560
Why Ai's keychain look that new?

98
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,120
I will take that, Hubby.

99
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,120
What are you doing?

100
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,880
Can I exchange it with you? Mine is already this black.

101
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,840
Nope, even with you making that cute face.

102
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,000
Even you begging me like a cat and I still won't give you.

103
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,360
This duck always is my friend to talk with when you do not care about me.

104
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,040
It's during test. After the exams are over, I will care about you all day.

105
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
I'll start by taking you on a trip.

106
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,480
When I'm done with the test, I always go out with Ton's Group.

107
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
I think of inviting them to north so I can visit your house at Nan.

108
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,160
Okay, and take them to my house.

109
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:14,480
But for now, could you take your hand off my waist? There are many people. I'm shy.

110
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,760
No, I'm cherished you. I'll show them you're mine.

111
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,080
I don't want anyone to meddle with you.

112
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,600
Everyone in this university know our relationship. You don't have to be like that.

113
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,800
Because of that Jida. Jida knows, the world knows.

114
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I think I will give Jida some snacks.

115
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,480
Just do what you want.

116
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,760
What about everyone? Aren't they finished yet?

117
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,000
In was coming out at the same time with me, but she's going to toilet.

118
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,400
And Nai is still sitting nervously in the room.

119
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,440
For Ton, he's being distracted. His paper is blank.

120
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,280
So to speak, Amp, Ton's girlfriend is heartless.

121
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:17,160
She asking for a breakup with him during tests, I'm worried about him.

122
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Are they really breakup? I saw them repeatedly date and break up for a long time.

123
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,600
Ton is impetuous.

124
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,880
I think Amp is angry and ask him for a breakup.

125
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,160
I think they're breaking up this time, Amp posts a pics with her new boyfriend.

126
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,160
Well, just break up. I'm annoyed that they quarrel.

127
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
How can he endure it for 8 years?

128
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Just tell this in front of Ton.

129
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,800
He will punch my face. Just stop talking about him.

130
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,400
I think I want to go north, and visiting Ai's house at Nan.

131
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,440
Great, Nan has many temples, let's take Ton to remove some bad luck.

132
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,599
When are you guys going?

133
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,160
I'll call my house first.

134
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Tomorrow.

135
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Ai, lend me your ipad,

136
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,640
I will make an action plan first.

137
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
It's in your bag.

138
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,280
I'll tell you something,

139
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
Ai. Your boyfriend really good at this.

140
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,880
Travelling plan, discount, food with promotion.

141
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,360
Discount Hotel, He's know everything.

142
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,480
But don't make him drive.

143
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,280
He will take you far from the destination.

144
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,200
You're just exaggeration.

145
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
I'm not that easily fooled.

146
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,120
Just love traveling so he goes out to find new places.

147
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,240
Don't believe him,

148
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,840
I think he has about a million excuses when he gets lost.

149
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,840
agree

150
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,640
I already sent all the plan in Line group.

151
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,560
Okay, I will take a look later.

152
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,400
Hey, I will tell some Joke and you guys just play along with me.

153
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,560
I want Ton to laugh.

154
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm worried. He's depressed that much.

155
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,520
Well.

156
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,880
Ahem, can you make a spoonerism?

157
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,880
Just come.

158
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,000
Suck.

159
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,480
Then I will start with you, Nai. Chai miang

160
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,960
Chiang mai.

161
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,760
Chai riang

162
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,000
Chiang rai

163
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,520
What's about Chai Noi?

164
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,160
Potjaman.

165
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
It's no jam...

166
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,720
Just enough, I'm fine.

167
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,040
He's heartbroken, and I have to play with you guys like a comedian?

168
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,480
I have a solution

169
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
Are you learning to measure?

170
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,000
You're annoying, In.

171
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,480
You want me to ordain and not leave the monkhood?

172
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,160
I'm worried about him. Anyway, which

173
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,560
You play along with him. Please, Ai.

174
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Please leave me a friend with good sanity.

175
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Well, Everything gonna be fine.

176
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,440
The wound is new. It's hurt like this. You will be fine soon.

177
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,760
It's a deep wound, I think I will take a long time to heal.

178
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,320
Just find someone to heal your heart

179
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,040
No, I still won't forget the old one and I don't want to take anyone new.

180
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,760
I want to be alone for some time.

181
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,800
If I were you, I don't want to be alone, silent will make you distracted.

182
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm sleepy. Let's go pack our bag.

183
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,640
Tomorrow leave at 8 o'clock,

184
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,840
whoever is late will pay for the food

185
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,360
Okay, whoever is late will pay for the food.
Yep!

186
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,440
Anyway guys, can I take my sister with me?

187
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,960
Who?

188
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,720
My neighborhood at Chonburi.

189
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,640
I've been close to her since I was a

190
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,120
You all have a couple, Nhai has Ai.

191
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,320
Nai also has you, I don't want to be alone.

192
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,560
Up to you. You can take her. But you should get better real soon.

193
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,400
ok?

194
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,040
Hi.

195
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,400
Me?

196
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,840
Yeah.

197
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,480
What do you want?

198
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,880
I want to tell you something. Can you spare me some time?

199
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,480
Yep

200
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,160
Well, I can't do well on the last test…

201
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,120
So what?

202
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,800
Well….I heard you're smart and I want you to teach me.

203
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,360
Why me?

204
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,160
Just teach me, okay?

205
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,160
I don't even know you. Just tell me what you want.

206
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,600
I can tell you the truth?

207
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,560
If you don't, I'll leave now.

208
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,400
If I told you the truth, will you teach me?

209
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
Yeah, just tell me.

210
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,560
I like you. Can I flirt with you?

211
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,280
Huh!?

212
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,840
I tell you now, so you will teach me,

213
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,960
Wa….wait. Really?

214
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well. Thanks bro!

215
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,680
I'll go now, see you!

216
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,920
I'll go

217
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,960
back to the room

218
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,360
Ai, I don't want to go back yet.

219
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,200
And what about your sleepy? Where do you think you will go this late?

220
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
At the school rooftop. Please take me there.

221
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,080
Can you go up there at this hour?

222
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,520
You can, just trust me. I always take the fire escape door there.

223
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,720
Please take me there.

224
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
Can I ever offend to you? Even I'm sleepy now.

225
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,560
Just take me there. I want to talk with you there. It's a nice view and a cold breeze.

226
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,520
The balcony of my condo has a good atmosphere.

227
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,880
Ai, I won't beg you anymore, just do your role as a driver.

228
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,240
The destination is school building, driver. Are you understand now?

229
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,160
Hubby argued with you, and it makes me a driver?

230
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,160
If I ever offend to you, what I will be?  A pet?

231
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
I won't raise a pet, I'm lazy to feed

232
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
What are you laughing?

233
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,400
Nothing, just think that you and I are different.

234
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,280
You don't like to take care, but I like it… Especially you.

235
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,480
That's not the reason you like me.

236
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,000
Trust me, you like me because I'm a romantic guy.

237
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,680
Huh?

238
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Romantic that you don't have.

239
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,880
But that's fine. You have a lot of good points, so I like you.

240
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,120
You jump at the chance.

241
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm sorry that I'm not a romantic guy. How is the romance of Nhai?

242
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Can you teach me?

243
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah, I will teach you on the rooftop

244
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,640
What are you looking at? Hmm?

245
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,960
From this position, If you look down, you will see a school building perfectly.

246
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,080
That's where we first met.

247
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,200
Do you remember

248
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,560
can remember

249
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,280
Yes, I saw you since you parked the car.

250
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,880
And think, why your legs are so beaut

251
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,640
On that day, I woke up late,

252
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,560
and curse you in my mind when you pull my shirt.

253
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,000
But when I saw you pick up my duck keychain.

254
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,160
From cursing you, it's change to like you instead.

255
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,920
I asked your name, but you just run away.

256
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,560
I heard it, but I'm hurried. Actually, I've come back to tell you,

257
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,720
but you are not there anymore.

258
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,800
And I was surprised that you are my classmate.

259
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
It's destiny.

260
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,640
Yeah, made me found you,

261
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,600
made me broke up with Khan-liew

262
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,120
Made me drunk, made me kissed you on that day...

263
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,520
Even if it blurred, but I still remember that kiss.

264
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,080
Let's kiss then.

265
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,840
Wait!! I have something for you to recall that kiss.

266
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,320
Because when I saw it, I always remember that night.

267
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,640
Something for me? I have to close my eyes?

268
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,080
Nope, just something normal.

269
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,560
Wasabi's bean, the same brand you ate before the kiss on that day.

270
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,000
Why's not the big pack? You're too stingy.

271
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,920
I can't put the big pack in my pocket

272
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,640
Well, at least I’m happy that you can remember that day, including the taste.

273
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,760
Why do you keep it? I bought it for you to eat. Please unwrap it. I'll eat it too.

274
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,400
Will you steal me?

275
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,440
Huh? Did you say something? I didn't

276
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,920
Nothing, when will we go back? It's about midnight.

277
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,240
How many minute before midnight?

278
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,480
Seven.

279
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,880
Then eat all the beans before going back.

280
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,000
I think you don't like wasabi?

281
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,560
Yse.

282
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,480
I eat it because you like it.

283
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm trying to know what you like.

284
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
What I like ?

285
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,320
I like is you.

286
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,040
No, It's love.

287
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,720
These sweet words, how long will it expired?

288
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,120
It's not expired that easily.

289
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,320
I don't believe you…

290
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,880
You know why am I taking you here?

291
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,240

292
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,600

Standing as a hero in the MV

307
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Nhai

308
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,000
Why did Ai take so long time to come down here?

309
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:07,080
Oh, Nhai. This is the sister I told you. Her name Chonlathee. Chon, this is Nhai.

310
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,400
Hi, Nhai.

311
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,440
What's wrong? Why do you look irritated?

312
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,320
You're fighting?

313
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,480
He's pout me. What should I do? He won't be riding with me.

314
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,280
What's happened?

315
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,000
He's disturbing me all night. I'm sleepy, I'm angry.

316
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,720
What's with that face? I'm even more hotheaded right now.

317
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,400
You said ‘disturbing you all night’, I can't think in a good way.

318
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,080
It’s not like that!

319
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,600
Ai just talked to me all night.

320
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,520
When I'm about to sleep, He's trying to poke me again.

321
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,080
So he's poke… Ai is so dangerous.

322
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
Shut up.

323
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,880
AI

324
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,360
Let's go, Ai. I'm angry at Ton now, I won't go with him.

325
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,440
What? Didn't you say you're mad at Ai and want to go with me?

326
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,000
When you fight with Ton, you go back to Ai.

327
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,920
You're so mercurial and always fight with others.

328
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,239
Just ride a motorcycle, so you don't have to rely on anyone.

329
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:49,360
Don't try to challenge me, we are going to Nan, not Lak Si, I'm not that stupid to ride there.

330
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,200
When you can't fight, you just run away. Ai, please reconcile with him, he angry at me instead of you now.

331
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,040
Ouch! Ton, why didn't you tell me you gonna stop?

332
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah, if it's a car, they might be crashed by now.

333
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,120
Chon, can you speak English?

334
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,960
Well, just play with him.

335
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,280
Yes.

336
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
What's about Yellow?

337
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,000
Yellow!

338
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,880
mango?

339
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,560
Mango!

340
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,000
Knife?

341
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,040
Butcher knife.

342
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,120
Stove?

343
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,880
Brazier!!!!

344
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,880
Ouch! It's hurt!

345
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,080
Well? When will you finish?

346
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,600
You don't enjoy us at all. What…

347
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,200
Let’s go

348
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,280
HI

349
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,720
Hey, I have a stomachache.

350
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,200
You can't do anything when someone is sick?

351
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,200
People will get sick, can it be forbidden?

352
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
Why didn't they just come down yet?

353
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:51,960
Yep

354
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,120
I agree.

355
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,720
Let's go down and find something to eat.

356
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,520
Haven't got out of the car yet?

357
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,200
No, they all got out of the car.

358
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm hungry

359
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,040
Upstairs the house should have prepared a lot of food.

360
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,600
so...

361
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,320
Let's concentrate first

362
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,520
Just choose. Will you walk or let me carry you?

363
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,120
Alright,

364
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm worried.

365
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,400
It's like I'm being forced to play at the football field.

366
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,320
You know that I'm not ready, right?

367
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,960
Hello, Sib, Jaonan, I'm Chen Nhai.

368
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,720
Sib in person is handsome and Jaonan is beautiful than Ai told me.

369
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,400
I'm heard of you too, Nhai.

370
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,880
From a distance, you really look like

371
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,040
I told you. Is he okay?

372
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,480
If you likes or loves him, I won't interfere with you.

373
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,000
Are you hungry now?

374
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,760
I know you like seafood, so I am talking to the chef to prepare it.

375
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:47,400
If you're going to travel early tomorrow, just eat and go to sleep.

376
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,320
yes.

377
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,960
AI

378
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,160
is Jaonan okay with me?

379
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't worry.

380
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Okay.

381
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,640
This seafood,

382
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,240
Jaonan prepared it for you. eat it all you want.

383
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,880
So that the one who prepared it won't be sad.

384
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,400
Okay. I will eat it all Gulf of Thailand and Andaman right now.

385
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,400
Thank for the meals.
