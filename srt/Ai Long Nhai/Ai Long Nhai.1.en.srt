Where are you?

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,360
Is that you Dad?

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Where are you?

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm at home

8
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,880
I'll ask you again, Where are you?

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm at home Dad…

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,040
Let's go back and talk at home, Aiyaret.

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,080
You don't have to hurry, but during that you should think about what kind of mistakes you have done.

12
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,720
Did Jaonan come with you?

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
No, he didn't. Don't expect to depend on him. We have to talk about this matter on our own.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Wait. Dad! Dad!

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
What's this.

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,320
Where are you going?

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,000
Home.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,720
Hey! What's going on?

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,520
How was it, Not fun?

20
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,600
What's Fun?

Last night…

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,640
Hey, look.

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,200
You're the best, but I got to go because my dad just arrived in Toronto

25
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,480
Seriously?

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,280
A little bit.

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Good bye.

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Bye.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,560
Good morning Dad. Are you tired? Would you like anything to drink?

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,240
Silence.

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
Oh Dad.

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,520
You don't have to be serious. Can we just talk?

33
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,800
You went too far this time. You quarreled until being expelled from university.

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,520
He started first.

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,320
I have never taught you to use emotion as a solution.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
What are you going to do?

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,320
I don't know. Why did you bring so many luggage?

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
It's not mine,

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,720
all of these are yours.

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,040
What!! What do you mean dad?

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,040
It means that you have to go back to Thailand with me.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,560
When?

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,400
Now!!

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,040
Right now!!

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,160
You have caused so many problems that I couldn't handle with you already.

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,760
Don't take it serious, Dad. Please Let me stay here!!!

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,960
No, I'm not allowing you to stay here.

49
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,200
Pack your bags now.

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,079
Your behavior is unacceptable.

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,560
And this time, don't expect that JaoNan could help you.

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,920
These are all my belonging and luggage

53
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,600
What do you want me to pack? You are going to force me to go back to Thailand anyway. It's terrible.

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,440
Swearing in any language couldn't make I change my mind.

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Terrible. Such a terrible moment.

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,040
If you go back with me, the car that grandfather bought as a present

57
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,800
will only be confiscated and let you use another car instead. But if you refuse to go back with me,

58
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,800
I'll sell it.

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,240
Please don't do that! It's my gift.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
One more thing, I will cancel all your credit cards.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Choose on your own. Go back with me, or you won't get anything.

62
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Oh, dad, if you planned to punish me like this, hitting me will be less painful.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
if I intense to hit you, it will be no mercy.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,880
JaoNan won't let you hit me.

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Because if you hit me one time, JaoNan will hit you back twice.

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,960
Aiyaret!

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,000
Where are you going?

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,560
I'm going to pack my belonging,

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
If I am stubborn, I can be famish.

70
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:03,280
You know that I can not handle with difficulties. I will go back  with you. Don't be so mean.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Just wonder when I was your age, Do I lose temper like you?

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,200
Maybe Not, because when you were my age,

73
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,440
You're probably writing a diary fantasizing about JaoNan most of the time.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,320
I will reduce your salary. Is that OK?

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,240
Oh, that's not good. Just pretend that I never said that OK? I'll go get my stuff.

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,640
Why is the weather so hot?

77
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,680
Are you done, Dad?

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,760
Wait a minute.

79
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,320
Come and help me to find the gift that I'll bring to Professor Amnat, please.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,520
What does it look like?

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,240
It's a pen box wrapped in white paper.

82
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,200
I remember putting it around here.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,360
Dad, why do you always like a big car like this?

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
And you can't find anything.

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Good luck that this time is just a pen box.

86
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
It's not a car key like last time.

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,920
It's normal to become forgetfulness because I'm old now.

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,280
It's not about getting old, Dad!

89
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
You've been forgetful since I can remember.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,280
Why did you keep complaining all the time?

91
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,040
This is the university where you used to be a teacher, right?

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,960
By the way, where is the faculty that JaoNan used to study?

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,680
I want to see it.

94
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's go and introduce yourself to the professor in the faculty first.

95
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,880
Then I will bring you to observe around the campus.

96
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,480
I'll come to observe on my own later. After this, you can rest. I will drive back to Nan by myself.

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,480
OK, So Can you come and help me find a pen now?

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,000
you're a really forgetful old man.

99
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,120
Aiyaret!

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,159
OK, Dad!!!

101
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,800
It should be here.

102
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,640
Dad, look over there.

103
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,880
Do you want that motorcycle?

104
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
If you live in Bangkok, You better use a car.

105
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
I think is it inconvenient when going travel for a long distance?

106
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm not talking about the car, Dad.

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
Look at the rider,

108
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,360
he look like JaoNan.

109
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,720
There is no one in this world like my JaoNan, No way...

110
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,640
Hmm.

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,880
Look similar.

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,480
Dad,

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
stop looking with those eyes,

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,960
or else I will tell JaoNan.

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
You already have JaoNan

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
This guys is mine.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,640
Not all the man will love the same sex, do you know?

118
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,000
My heart tells me,

119
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
My heart tells me that

120
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,680
he Must be mine.

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,760
Enough.

122
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,680
You used to say  when you first met Nan, you were mesmerized by his sight.

123
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,560
So I fell in love because of those legs too.

124
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,360
I'll be right back.

125
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,200
Hey, where are you going?

126
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,240
Ai, Aiyaret!

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
Yellow duck.

128
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,600
Oh! Mr. Ducky!!

129
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,560
You dropped it over there

130
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you.

131
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
- What is your name?
- Thank you so much.

132
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,320
if I lost Mr.Ducky, it would be a big problem.

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,640
OK.

134
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,880
Let's go Mr. Ducky we are late now.

135
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Wait!

136
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
I didn't know his name yet.

137
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
Do you still want to go back to Nan?

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,400
Or today you want to go to study with him?

139
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,240
Dad,

140
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,520
can you tell me about the first time you met JaoNan?

141
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,920
Then how did you know it was love?

142
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
I can tell you

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,920
But I can't tell you what love is.

144
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,880
You have to learn it by yourself.

145
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,440
Then use the feeling to answer yourself whether it is love or not.

146
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,320
I think this time is right.

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,560
Will he say yes to you?

148
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,880
Do you know who he is? What's his name?

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,160
Umm. Umm...

150
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,880
Even asking the name is also ignored.

151
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
It looked like he had been heartbroken from the start.

152
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Oh, Mr. Sippakorn, why don't you cheer me up?

153
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,560
Here we go. The professor is waiting.

154
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,520
Thank you.

You arrived on time. Always come to class ion the last minutes  from the first year until the second year.

159
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,080

160

Please Learn to iron your shirt, Mr. Chen Nhai.

161
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,680
Hahaha, it's my style.

162
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
Alright, let's go to your seat.

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,280
Hi guys.

164
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,440
We'll start the lesson, everyone.

165
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
You're late again!

166
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,280
It's all your fault.

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
Nobody called me to wake me up.

168
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm in a hurry

169
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,680
and almost lost my Mr. Ducky.

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,840
By the way, someone can pick it up for me.

171
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
So handsome.

172
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,320
Thank you. I have been handsome since I was born.

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,400
Not you,

174
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
I mean that guy who picks up my Mr. Ducky.

175
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Nhai, That's my pen.

176
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,120
Can I Borrow it? I lost my pen yesterday.

177
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,440
Or you can give it to me.

178
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,080
What? If you borrow my pen, which one will I use?

179
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,120
Ummm…

180
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,640
Maybe you can borrow Nine???

181
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,480
No, you have to borrow him yourself.

182
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
- Nine…
- What?

183
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,480
Mr. honors.

184
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,720
Can I borrow your pen?

185
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
You can use my pen,

186
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,680
I'll find another pen for you.

187
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,560
Always borrow others nearly every day.

188
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,520
More is the trouble that other people have to take care of your Mr. Ducky.

189
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,080
There's a rule that I can't lose this duck.

190
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,520
If I lose it, my father will not give me any money.

191
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,440
You guys have to help me take care of my Mr.Ducky. OK?

192
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,960
Why does your Mr. Ducky is related to us?

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,680
You guys know I'm forgetful.

194
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,280
You guys have to help me take care of Mr. Ducky.

195
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,800
So who is the guy that picks up your Mr. Ducky?

196
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,320
I don't know too.

197
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,560
I never see him before.

198
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,080
But so handsome, very handsome,

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,200
handsome as the  main actor from BL series

200
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,960
So why don't you become his boyfriend?

201
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,280
Let him take care of you and your Mr. Ducky.

202
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,920
Shut up.

203
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,480
You know I already have someone in mind.

204
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,720
My goal is to win the heart of Kanliew, the prom queen from the faculty of Business.

205
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,120
Have you ever told your father about flirting with Kanliew?

206
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Yes.

207
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,360
As soon as I told him,

208
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,280
my father gave me Mr. Ducky key chain.

209
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,840
Your father must have told you indirectly.

210
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,720
Before taking care of anyone, take care of the duck first.

211
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,920
Are you saying that Nhai can't take care of himself?

212
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
Oops.

213
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
It's all true.

214
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,840
OMG! Are you all my friends?

215
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,120
Yes, but now I'm going to study.

216
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
And if not silent, Don't even think about copying the Lecture.

217
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
OK, sir!

218
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,400
Quiet!!

219
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,200
You are the one who keeps talking.

220
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,200
Dad, do you think JaoNan will like it?

221
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,200
I miss my childhood,

222
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,080
when I make a mistake

223
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,240
I'll collect this flower and give it to JaoNan.

224
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,080
Jaonan will always smile.

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,400
Flattering.

226
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
Why are you jealous of your son?

227
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,720
It's supposed to.

228
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,680
Even bring flowers to JaoNan. It won't help to reduce.

229
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,000
Very nice smell.

230
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
He must like it.

231
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
JaoNan.

232
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Welcome back

233
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,480
I miss JaoNan very much.

234
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,360
Acts like we haven't seen each other for a long time

235
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,000
even though we just met

236
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
JaoNan,

237
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,720
Dad took my car.

238
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,200
Huh, didn't he tell you that

239
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,480
that is my idea!!

240
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,560
I didn't tell him

241
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
because I waited him to hear from you.

242
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm the one who told your dad to take your car as punishment

243
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,320
and told you to return to Thailand.

244
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,040
What!!!

245
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
We will not talk about the past.

246
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,440
While being punished,

247
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,840
you can't do anything wrong anymore.

248
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm so sorry.

249
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,400
Are you angry at me?

250
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm not angry; I can understand the anger of youth.

251
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,840
I chose to punish you first

252
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,560
because if it's your father, he will punished you more severely.

253
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,120
You should know that.

254
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,320
Be nice, OK?

255
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,120
because we are not that kind.

256
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,760
OK!

257
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
Let's go have lunch, JaoNan.

258
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,000
Dad and Mom must have waited a long time as well.

259
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,720
Ai, It's heavy.

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,520
I love JaoNan more than you, Dad.

261
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,840
OK, Up to you.

262
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,800
Maybe I think I gave you too much money.

263
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,920
Dad! I love you as same as JaoNan.

264
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
You are liar.

265
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,280
As same as you.

266
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,560
Wow!

267
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,840
Cutie pie!

268
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,079
Just woke up or haven't slept yet?

269
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,640
What's the reason that makes you play the fiddle?

270
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,520
and playing in bad rhythm.

271
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,200
I can't sleep.

272
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,680
I played in bad rhythm because I thought of something.

273
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,560
- What are you thinking about?
- Bangkok!!

274
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,040
Huh?

275
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,480
I've never seen you so excited about moving to the new university.

276
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm not excited.

277
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,200
I miss someone there.

278
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,920
Dad hasn't woken up yet?

279
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,000
He is still sleeping! Maybe tired.

280
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,760
Busy for many days.

281
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
You have to stop being so stubborn.

282
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,040
Umm... this time, what the point of arguing is?

283
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,480
My life was too good, so they got upset and tried to harm me.

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,080
Well, I never asked. Do you have any friends there?

285
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,920
No. I like being alone.

286
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,080
It's really good to have friends.

287
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,400
So who do you thinking of?

288
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,240
Mr. Ducky.

289
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,120
Hmm?? Duck or people?

290
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,400
The man with the duck keychain.

291
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,280
The face is slender,

292
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,880
the hair is like this, and the eyes are small. The nose is like this.

293
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,560
Ummm… OK, OK.

294
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,480
Let's go get paper and pencil and draw for me to see, shall we?

295
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,640
Draw in the air like this. How do I know

296
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,320
that the person who can make Ai can't go to sleep? What does he look like?

297
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,080
This is how he looks like,

298
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,040
from a long distance, he looks like you.

299
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,760
But when I look closely, it's not.

300
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
I had a dream about him last night.

301
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,440
When I woke up, he was still in my mind

302
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,400
I can't sleep anymore.

303
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't know what to do.

304
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,360
Are you fallen in love???

305
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,760
I think so.

306
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Then you should approach him.

307
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,640
If he doesn't like me?

308
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Play fiddle for him.

309
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,200
Haha, he could misunderstand and thought that I playing the fiddle for "Buffalo."

310
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,040
Then......just force him to love.

311
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,920
Is that OK?

312
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,640
Just kidding.

313
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't do that.

314
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,800
If you like him, try to approach him and flirt.

315
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,440
But if he doesn't like you, don't bother him.

316
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
OK!! I understand.

317
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,080
I study at the same faculty with him; I still have a lot of time.

318
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
Well, I'm here for you, Ai.

319
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,840
Tomorrow you have to go back to Bangkok, right?

320
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,640
Yes, I have to go back to university.

321
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,160
Professor Amnat is afraid that I won't be able to catch up with my friends.

322
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,360
I just realized that Professor Amnat is teacher.

323
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,400
When he is in Canada, he's like the naughty pilot.

324
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,760
I don't know how I got close to dad.

325
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,480
Your dad is a player too.

326
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm lucky that he loves me with all of his heart.

327
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,240
Oh, if my father came to hear this,

328
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,320
he would surely smile.

329
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,920
I have looked at the results of our studies in Canada.

330
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
Very good.

331
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,120
I doubt your father taught you well.

332
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,080
My father taught me my homework last time when I was eight years old.

333
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,080
After that,

334
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,440
I am completely dependent on myself.

335
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,760
OK! You are intelligent.

336
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
But that doesn't mean you have permission to get into a quarrel,

337
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,680
your dad tells me to keep an eyes on you.

338
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
Of course not!

339
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,800
If no one starts first…

340
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,320
What did you say???

341
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,680
I definitely don't.

342
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,680
It's time to study. Let's go to the classroom.

343
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,800
I just got my nails done. Beautiful?

344
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,920
Very nice.

345
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,880
Very annoying.

346
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,120
Everyone coming?

347
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,840
My class no one can miss!

348
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,240
Chen Nhai hasn't arrived yet, Master.

349
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,120
But wait a minute, he will show up.

350
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,880
Oh Chen Nhai, I like your friend Intha.

351
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
He arrived on time for every class.

352
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,560
Everyone wonders who is the handsome young man next to me.

353
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
His name is Aiyaret

354
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,520
and will be your classmate.

355
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,920
He just returned from Canada. So he joined us in the middle of the semester.

356
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
Chen Nhai is here!

357
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,520
Oh! My Mr. Ducky's picker?

358
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,560
Yellow ducky.

359
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,960
Very punctual, Mr. Chen Nhai,

360
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,640
but I haven't checked yet.

361
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,920
Did I come on time?

362
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Master, don't be kidding.

363
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Be quiet. The class next to us has already started.

364
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,000
Come and sit here. No one sits here.

365
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,000
Can I sit with Chen Nhai?

366
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
As you wish.

367
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,160
What a small world!

368
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,600
What's your name?

369
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
Master already introduce him already.

370
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,520
you're late, so you don't know.

371
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,040
Aiyaret right ?

372
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
I'm Ton.

373
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
he is Nine.

374
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm Intha.

375
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,040
I'm Chen Nhai.

376
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Nice to meet you.

377
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,560
Aiyaret!!

378
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,680
You can call me Just "AI."

379
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
I think it is a little bit too long.

380
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,360
"Called Me Ai Only."

381
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,520
I think it is a little bit too long.

382
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,360
Can we talk not politely? I'm not fluent to speak politely.

383
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,840
I'm OK.

384
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
So why did you come in the middle of the semester?

385
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
when I saw you, I thought that you were in  another faculty.

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,120
I'm just back from Canada.

387
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Yesterday, Nhai told me that you picked up Mr.ducky for him, right?

388
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,680
Huh.

389
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,680
And Nhai said you very handsome.

390
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,320
Nine, Stop!!

391
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,080
See, he's really handsome, like I said.

392
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,880
Look at his face!!

393
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,920
Yes! He is handsome.

394
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,840
Why did you touch his face?

395
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,680
The handsome face will be all dirty.

396
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,760
Ton!!

397
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,000
After classes, let's go get something to eat. Nhai will treat us.

398
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,520
Why have to be me?

399
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,960
To celebrate that Ai is keeping your Mr.ducks for you.

400
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,960
Nhai, if Ai didn't pick your Mr. Ducky that day,

401
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,640
your father will kill you.

402
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,520
Just treat us a little bit. you won't die, right?

403
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,240
So let's pay half of it.

404
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,680
I pay because you pick my Mr. Ducky!

405
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,400
You pay because we're friends.

406
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,600
for the others, just thinks that it is for charity.

407
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,200
OK!

408
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,560
Did you ask him? It's he wants to be your friend or not?

409
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
In!!

410
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,280
We are no longer friend Because I got a new friend.

411
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,600
Right?, Mr.Aiyaret.

412
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,080
What do you want to eat?

413
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,840
Don't answer "anything".

414
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,440
I want to eat fried chicken.

415
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
And I'd like to try sitting on the back of your motorcycle too.

416
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,000
Sure!! Mr. Aiyaret.

417
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,880
Chen Nhai Bike is happy to serve you.

418
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,160
Near or far away. Will it be a price according to the distance?

419
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,560
Or a kilometer? What will you choose?

420
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,400
Choose one or both, I can pay for it all.

421
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
What? You've got a new friend.

422
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,840
What are you studying?

423
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,120
Hey.

424
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,360
What do you want to eat?

425
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
I want to eat fried chicken.

426
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,920
I didn't ask you.

427
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,800
But I want to answer!! Did you have a problem?

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,120
Stop, let's go to the mall behind the university, OK?

429
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
How will you go? Do you have your car?

430
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,200
I'm going to park the car here and go with Nhai.

431
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,120
- Ai, Please don't...
- What your problem, Ton ??

432
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Shut up!!!

433
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,160
You can go with my car.

434
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,040
That's OK.

435
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,800
I want to try sitting on the back of Nhai's motorcycle.

436
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,000
Hey, you see?

437
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,800
My best friend Ai wants to go with me.

438
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,760
You guys just go

439
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
I'm cheering you on.

440
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
You know I'm the most handsome.

441
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,920
Boo, Brother Ton dared to post.

442
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
It must be you.

443
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,040
Let's waiting to see, Ton.

444
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,480
I will focus on studying and able to study at the same University as you do.

445
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,440
I already thought that Nhai would be late.

446
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,960
Is it he?

447
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,240
Finally.

448
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,080
Where did you take Ai around the world?

449
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,200
Oh, what? I brought him to a shortcut.

450
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
Where is my water?

451
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,040
Here she just got it for you because you came so late!!

452
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,480
Your shortcut way? Always lost..

453
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,880
So why did you come so fast?

454
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,760
we come in normal way,

455
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,600
but the guy who rides a motorcycle for you isn't normal.

456
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,160
If not lost, not detour, not Chen Nai.

457
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,360
It's true! There was a trip that we went to Phetchabun.

458
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I'll go with Nine's car.

459
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,560
But  He said he wanted to go by himself.

460
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,680
He appeared at Prachinburi province

461
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
and he missed that trip.

462
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,480
Silence and eat.

463
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
Stop ruining my picture.

464
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,320
Picture?

465
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,920
Are you talking about a personal image?

466
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, Correct!

467
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,240
Congratulations!

468
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,040
You are the first person who understands Nhai's Joke.

469
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,480
Since I was born,

470
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,160
I don't see anyone understanding Nhai's joke

471
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,240
The last person just broke up with Nhai

472
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,920
because of his bad joke.

473
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,200
Alright.

474
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,880
Are all of you bullying me?

475
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
I will get revenge by revealing all of you guys' girls stories!

476
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,280
Do it. Come on!

477
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,000
Let's start with Ton.

478
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,600
Well, Ton

479
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
Urmm, Ton..

480
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,080
Ugh.

481
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,640
Why don't you guys have a "peak" story.

482
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,120
Because our behavior aren't like you.

483
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,400
Well, that's such a pity.

484
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
Don't you have a girlfriend?

485
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,440
Nope.

486
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
Single, so single

487
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,760
single like..I can't believe that a handsome guy like me will be single.

488
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,520
And these guys,

489
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,920
you don't have to care about them.

490
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,280
Ai,

491
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,640
don't you have a girlfriend?

492
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,600
Oh, Intha.

493
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,000
Look at his handsome face, he looks just like a superstar.

494
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,120
If he doesn't have a girlfriend, that is strange.

495
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,480
Um.. I don't have a girlfriend, I am single.

496
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,040
- Really!
- Huh!

497
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,880
Are you serious? I can't believe.

498
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,480
Well, I will find a lover around here.

499
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,760
I have something to ask you guys.

500
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,840
What kind of person do you guys like?

501
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,200
I like a nice person, cute,

502
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,560
and the one who only loves me.

503
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
I like the person who I like.

504
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,920
I have the same mindset as Intha.

505
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,200
How about you?

506
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,680
I already have the person that I like.

507
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
Kanliew.

508
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,800
The freshman prom queen of the Faculty of  Business.

509
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,840
She has a long hair with little arm hair.

510
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,720
You are a psychopath.

511
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,360
You don't understand Nine.

512
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,160
People with arm hair are so attractive.

513
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,560
Right, Ai?

514
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,400
I have no idea.

515
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't have hair on my arm.

516
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
What's wrong with you? Even if you have hair on your arm, I still don't like you.

517
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,760
I feel giggle.

518
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,040
That's hurt.

519
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,120
Hey, just kidding.

520
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,080
I will share the straw with you.

521
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,040
The straw to commit our friendship.

522
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
Nhai!

523
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,160
Your straw is dirty.

524
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
Why are you still offering him?

525
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,960
I ordered all the beverages for everyone.

526
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
Ai.

527
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,080
It's OK. I don't mind.

528
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,120
Listen well, all of you.

529
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,360
From now on, my new best friend is Ai

530
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,920
and you guys are just common friends.

531
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,160
That's fine.

532
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,120
His hands were dirty, still hugging his neck.

533
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,440
My best friend.

534
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,720
Alright.

535
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,440
Ai!

536
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
Why are you daydreaming?

537
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,280
Isn't it delicious?

538
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,480
Nothing.

539
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,120
Let's eat.

540
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,360
This looks tasty.

541
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,640
Well, Kimji at this restaurant is so delicious.

542
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,880
Let's me try.

543
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,280
Yeah, delicious!

544
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,680
Yeah, right.

545
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,400
- Hey, Kimji is so delicious. Let's try.
- Yum.

546
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,600
That's French fries.

547
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,080
Why are you making that face?

548
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,120
You want to ride with Nhai, isn't it?

549
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,760
That's so funny; how was the biker feeling?

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,840
Don't you feel like you went through the war?

551
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,960
If you are not OK with my ride,

552
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
you can go back with these guys.

553
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
I didn't say anything.

554
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,760
Nhai.

555
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,800
I didn't say anything.

556
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,840
See ya.

557
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,400
Let's go.

558
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,920
Let's go back.

559
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,840
What's wrong with those guys?

560
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,600
Where do you park the car?

561
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,320
So, I can send you to the car.

562
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,840
Did you get angry at me?

563
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,640
Nope.

564
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,120
So where is your car?

565
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,880
There.

566
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,080
Wow!

567
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,000
You drive BMW?!

568
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,040
Yes.

569
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,800
My dad wants me to drive this car.

570
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,360
You are so rich.

571
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,640
JaoNan has many cars.

572
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
If you like sports cars, you should visit my home in Nan province.

573
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,640
I have never been to Nan Province before.

574
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,880
We should ask our friends to go.

575
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
Why not? Let's go.

576
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,200
Well, you just talk to me...

577
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,640
Does that me you are OK with me now?

578
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,360
Nope.

579
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,600
I am not mad at you.

580
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,800
Well, on the weekend let's have the party at my place.

581
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,320
Anything that you want to eat, I will take care of you.

582
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,320
Deal?

583
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,640
Deal!

584
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,800
You promise to prepare anything that I want.

585
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,400
Yes, as you wish.

586
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,480
Where do you live?

587
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,880
Nearby the university.

588
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,000
How about you? Stay at the condo or go back home?

589
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
Condo.

590
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,040
My condo just opposite the university.

591
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,280
Take care then.

592
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,320
I will go back now.

593
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,720
Nhai,

594
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,080
how about we download the GPS and share information?

595
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,120
- What's that?
- It's a map.

596
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Well, Intha

597
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,960
told me that you always lose the way.

598
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,040
If you have this application and lost the way, I can pick you up.

599
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,719
Hey.

600
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,639
That's a good idea, let's download it.

601
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,719
But you have to download it for me I am a kind of low-tech person.

602
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,840
Sure,

603
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,400
there you go.

604
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,480
OK, I am leaving. Bye.

605
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,639
Thank you, Chen Nhai

606
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,600
for giving me a ride to my car.

607
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,720
Why are you grooming yourself?

608
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,680
I thought that you had already left.

609
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,480
I am about to go back.

610
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,800
Where are you going?

611
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,800
I'll go to the dormitory.

612
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,760
Dormitory? Why are you going there?

613
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,520
I will go there to flirt with Kanliew.

614
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,800
Kanliew is always at the Dormitory common space with her friends.

615
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,320
I'll go with you.

616
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,960
Do you like Karn Liw as well?

617
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Nah.

618
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I will assist you.

619
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,960
No way. You are way too handsome. She might change her mind  and like you instead.

620
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,640
That's will not going to happen. Besides, I don't like the person who has arm hair.

621
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,200
Come on Chen Nhai.

622
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,560
Handsome Chen Nhai.

623
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,480
Please...

624
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,360
Please let me go with you.

625
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,560
Fine. Let's go.

626
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Thank you.

627
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,800
Hey! Did you guys say you will come and read the book? Why don't you guys pay attention?

628
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,160
Right!! Don't even have book.

629
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,760
Who say they coming for study?

630
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,880
This building is a female dormitory.

631
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,800
But as you can see that it full of men.

632
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,240
They always claim likes comes to buy some food,

633
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,000
but actually flirt with girls.

634
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,280
Same as you right?

635
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
Yes. No!!

636
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,520
I don't claim.

637
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,160
I'm here to flirt 100%

638
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,080
Someone brought a guitar to play.

639
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,720
Next time I will bright the guitar here too.

640
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,680
Hmm, can you play as well?

641
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,800
I can play music before holding a pencil and pen..

642
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,760
Kanliew.

643
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,280
She is coming!!!

644
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,920
Your are overacting.

645
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,600
Ai did she go?? Am I still handsome?

646
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,360
What can I do????

647
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,600
Hi Nhai! Did you come and find something to eat again??

648
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Hi!

649
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,360
Who is this guy??

650
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,960
Kanliew, you don't have to care about him.

651
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,640
Just care about me, OK? Do you want to take a seat?

652
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,760
You can come and sit here.

653
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,560
It's OK!! I can go and sit with my friends.

654
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,000
See you later. Bye!

655
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,520
Oh, just carrying a guitar and you look handsome.

656
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,080
I thought that you were lost.

657
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,200
Did you care about me?

658
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,640
What's wrong with you?

659
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,040
But what song will you play?

660
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,320
Can I have a nice song for Kanliew?

661
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Where is she?

662
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,800
Over there!

663
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,560
Are you having a problem recognizing people face?

664
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
She is so cute!!!

665
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,720
You are cuter.

666
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,960
What did you say??

667
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,160
Nothing!!

668
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,440
OMG!! He is my type….

669
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,840
If a man sings and flirts with me like this, my heart is for him since he starts playing the guitar.

670
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,320
I think the person sitting next to him is much cuter, very cute.

671
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,800
Looks more like he's singing and flirting together.

672
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,640
OMG!!

673
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,240
Shut up.

674
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,040
Shut your mouth.

675
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,640
Even if you flirt with a girl or flirt with themselves, I don't care anyway.

676
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
I like it anyway.

677
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,480
Do you think like me? B1.

678
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,560
Let's go, B2!!

679
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,600
Yes right there.

680
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,280
You came to help me flirt her,

681
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,040
or come flirt for yourself?

682
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,760
Everyone's looking at you now.

683
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
So what? I don't care about them.
