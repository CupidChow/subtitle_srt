00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Senior, what disease does sister-in-law have?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can't you cure it?

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She has a problem from her mother's womb

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I asked my master, he said my prescription was right

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But she is too weak, her health is too weak

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's harder to endure in winter

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sometimes she can sleep for a few days, sometimes she wakes up but can't sleep

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
With you, sister-in-law will be fine

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you for your advice

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why did you buy such a big house?

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sister-in-law is weak

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not good for her to recover

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Look at these rooms

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They are all used to accommodate those poor patients

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It looks calm now

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's because they all went home with illness

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They are not in good health

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No wonder the people respect you so much

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You deserve the word people

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Senior is from a noble family

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He is well-educated and has a good reputation

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He always says that others can't cure him

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's why he is famous

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If it wasn't for his illness

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He would be like me now

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He would travel around to find strange symptoms

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a pity

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I hope you can be touched by this

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let him and his wife be together forever

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't run, stop

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where is that place?

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It seems to be Senior's pharmacy

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Help, someone stole the medicine

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Help

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Little Song

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Brother Sun, someone stole the medicine

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What happened?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The medicine that Master worked hard to plant was all destroyed by the thief

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If Dong Chu knows, he will scold me again

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Where is that thief?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We chased him and he ran away

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Take me to see

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That way

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That way

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He didn't come to pick the medicine

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I saw him standing there

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why didn't he steal the medicine?

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If he wanted to steal the medicine

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He should have taken some medicine

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But the medicine in the pharmacy was all taken by him

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
From the root

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There is no trace of pulling or picking

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When you see him

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He may have jumped over the wall and was standing up

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not squatting

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sister is really good

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No wonder that bad boy in the heart

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Senior

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Good

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you see that person's face clearly?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't see clearly

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When I called him, he didn't turn his head and ran away

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What happened?

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Uncle Dong

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There are many thieves here

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We need to send more people to search

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are thoughtful

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When we enter the east

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We can't avoid the poor people in the mountains

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We just need to be more careful

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are so weird

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What if you are scared of your wife?

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Uncle Dong

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am wrong

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You just give me a bite to eat

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can punish me as you want

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This child

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come on, get up

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I am wrong

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't be afraid

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why don't you give me food?

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't be afraid

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He is also the child of the poor people taken by the young master

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He was afraid before

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's late

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mr. Song

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Please send your wife back

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Aunt Lin will send the dinner to everyone's yard

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you uncle Dong

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are welcome

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Xiaowan, little sister

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Little sister

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why are you back so late?

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Come on, come on

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hurry up

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Come here, come here

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sit down

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I woke up today and saw you were not here

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I just want to go out to find you

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I didn't expect to find you

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I watched a good show

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Where is Xiaowan?

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where did you go this morning?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why can't you find people everywhere?

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe you went to see her brother

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Brother and sister

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's not even dawn yet

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why is it so smelly?

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Look, what is that?

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let me see

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you looking at?

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's wrong?

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you looking at?

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What is this?

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you looking at?

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you looking at?

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My lady

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's the corpse of the wild

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The corpse of the wild

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I thought it was night

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My lady, come here

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why are there so many corpses of the wild?

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you okay?

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why don't you pull me?

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why don't you pull me?

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're laughing at me

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What kind of sister are you?

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What kind of sister are you?

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't want to

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Little white butterfly

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Sorry to disturb you

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm here to accompany you

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sixth sister

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I was almost scared to death

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is the state of the dead

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you okay?

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's okay

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Later

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I deliberately mentioned the Bai family

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a famous family in Yizhou

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Qin Xiang's eyes are looking at the white man

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's about to drop

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Where are the corpses of the wild?

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I want to see

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why are you looking at those things?

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The white man was buried by the servant

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ni er

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You said those corpses were broken by people

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like being cut by a knife

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will never be wrong on the sword

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Niangzi

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm here to deliver snacks

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What kind of snacks?

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's tea

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I also want to have a try

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't want to go back to that room

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm full when I see it

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm rough

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Please don't mind

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This tea is better than ours

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can taste it

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm glad you like it

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The young master ordered

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There will be old women and children in these days

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,760
Young Mistress has ordered me to serve the ladies for a few days.

182
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
They call you Young Mistress.

183
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Are you the housewife of the eldest brother?

184
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Yes. Only Lao Dong and I are here with Young Mistress.

185
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,160
The others were left by themselves after Young Mistress cured them.

186
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
The tea in the tea house is better than the local people's.

187
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
It's really amazing.

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
I didn't know how to do it.

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,920
After Young Mistress cured me of my anxiety,

190
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,240
I suddenly opened the door to the living skills on the stove.

191
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
You can even cure a heart disease?

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes.

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Young Mistress said that I have a bad heart disease.

194
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
It's good to be cured.

195
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Ladies, please enjoy your meal.

196
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
If you want to eat anything, just tell me.

197
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I'll open the door for you.

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Xiaowan,

199
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
your eldest brother's medical skills are better than yours.

200
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
The eldest brother is the best.

201
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Mmm.

202
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
My dear, Young Mistress,

203
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
things are ready.

204
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Good!

205
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Yanx未's health is worse now!

206
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
They killed Song Zi!

207
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Jiao!

208
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Where are you going?

209
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Something unf dessared has happened.

210
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,080
I'll go and have a look

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,160
You can't go

212
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,480
You treat me well

213
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,680
I can't just stand by and watch

214
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,200
the family's business

215
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
This is not Jingzhou

216
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
No one will help you

217
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,880
If your Yan's story is spread out

218
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,920
Do you want your sister's life?

219
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,720
Who dares to say bad words to Xiaowan

220
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,400
Ask me if I agree

221
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,160
Go

222
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
But

223
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,120
Sister Jiu

224
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,320
Brother San, don't worry

225
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,680
Sister Jiu's ability

226
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,280
Even the prince of Yan and the House of Huozhi admire it very much

227
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
It won't ruin the reputation

228
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,200
Really?

229
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,120
Then sister Liu

230
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,360
You can talk slowly

231
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,080
Say more

232
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,280
I'm sorry to trouble you

233
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,800
Don't tell me this first, brother

234
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
Thank you for your concern

235
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Little Songzi is here

236
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Don't go

237
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,640
Fulin, go and bring my box and pen

238
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,160
Yes

239
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
I'll go with you, I have time

240
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,920
Go

241
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,600
Who did this to little Songzi?

242
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
Come here

243
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,520
Send someone to report it

244
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,840
But

245
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,040
About 70 miles from the site

246
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,720
It's taking twice a day to take back what you've got

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,640
I'll report it

248
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,400
Senior, three days after the crime is the best time to investigate

249
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,040
We can't wait for the government to come

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,840
We have to investigate everything

251
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,720
If there is a delay, at least we can keep some early evidence

252
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
Ok

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Who is the first to find out about Little Song?

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,720
It's me

255
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
So early? Why are you here?

256
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,280
I am responsible for daily cleaning

257
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,360
I am going down the mountain when I am fully recovered

258
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I am grateful for your life

259
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,680
I got up early this morning to clean the snow for you

260
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,360
But I saw a wild cat on the way

261
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,600
I chased after it all the way

262
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Then I saw Little Song

263
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,880
You are still weak

264
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Why do you chase after that wild cat?

265
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Yesterday, Mr. Bai told me

266
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,200
to catch the wild cat clean

267
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
So that the ladies won't be scared at night

268
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,280
You can go down first

269
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,440
Don't go anywhere for these two days

270
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,280
The maid will come to you again to ask you questions

271
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
I remember

272
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,120
Little Waner

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,640
Let me do it

274
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,080
Let me do it

275
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
Thank you, senior

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
Little Waner, your third brother seems to be discussing with the butler

277
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,880
He wants to go on the road immediately

278
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,840
No one can go in this situation

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,160
3 actions

280
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,520
Brother, send the letters

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,720
What to write

282
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,080
The usual

283
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,720
You say, I write

284
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,800
Write down everything I say

285
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,240
Ok

286
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,360
Cheatervan

287
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,900
Decade

288
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,120
Miss

289
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,400
Thirteen years old

290
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,120
The birthday girl

291
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:27,200
Bring me a

292
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,280
But the sword is sharp, so the arm is not cut off.

293
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,280
The wound is not cut out of the chest.

294
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
The murder scene did not see the weapon.

295
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Judging from the shape of the wound,

296
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,280
the weapon should be a long-lasting steel that can be cut and stabbed.

297
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
It's rough and like...

298
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
a chisel.

299
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Is the murderer a lunatic who has committed murder?

300
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,280
How could he have such a big evil intention on Little Song Zi?

301
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
We need to investigate further.

302
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Please let us surround this place and keep an eye on it.

303
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,280
After the government checks, we will make a plan.

304
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Don't worry.

305
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Little Song Zi's parents are both dead.

306
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
He is an orphan.

307
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
He is just like me. He is also anxious.

308
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Since he was a child, he was pushed by his relatives.

309
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
He is homeless and has a hard life.

310
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Later, the young master cured him.

311
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
He stayed.

312
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
I wanted to take him as my son.

313
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I took care of him since he was young.

314
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
He raised me.

315
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Who knew he was harmed by others?

316
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,280
God of Ice, has Little Song Zi had a fight with someone recently?

317
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
No.

318
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
He is always obedient and obedient.

319
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,280
He would never offend others.

320
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Infection?

321
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Ni, go to the wall and check if there are any new footprints.

322
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Okay.

323
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,280
The wall is covered by snow.

324
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Little Song Zi, what are the new footprints?

325
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Why did it snow last night?

326
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
No matter if the footprints are new or old,

327
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
let's see if there are footprints on the snow.

328
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
No.

329
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Little Song Zi!

330
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Little Song Zi,

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
you suspect that it is a group of thieves?

332
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
You suspect that it is a group of thieves?

333
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
God of Ice said that Little Song Zi never had a fight with others.

334
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
But the thieves were found by Little Song Zi yesterday.

335
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
We have to be careful.

336
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Little Song Zi ruined the good deeds of the thieves yesterday.

337
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
That's why he was so cruel to Little Song Zi.

338
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,280
The case is the most difficult to investigate.

339
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,280
The evidence is not enough to make any conclusions.

340
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
If it is really that thief,

341
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,280
he should have come in at least a few hours ago.

342
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
The footprints are covered by snow.

343
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
What should we do now?

344
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Find the weapon.

345
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Did you find the weapon?

346
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,280
But the greenhouse did lose a knife.

347
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
If the criminal takes the weapon,

348
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
it is very likely that he will commit the crime again.

349
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,280
But the snowy road is difficult to walk.

350
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
The people in the government office will arrive tomorrow night.

351
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
We can only rely on ourselves now.

352
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
We don't have many guards.

353
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
If we all live separately, we may not be able to take care of it.

354
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Tell Big Brother.

355
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,280
If Madam can move, it is better to live with us.

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Okay. I will go tell Young Master.

357
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Little Sister, what about me? What should I do?

358
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Such a big snow will hide a lot of traces.

359
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
There is no guard in the house.

360
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Outsiders have the opportunity to sneak in.

361
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
It is not without their own people.

362
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
We will ask the missing people.

363
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,280
They said that the people who entered and left the house are suspicious.

364
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Good.

365
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I learned this from Young Master Yan.

366
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
Little Sister, don't say that.

367
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
At this moment, I really miss him.

368
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Ning'er, why are you here?

369
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
I am here to guard the door.

370
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
I am better at guarding the door than Fulin.

371
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
What about you? Have you found anything?

372
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
There are places to go and places to enter.

373
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
All the words are correct.

374
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
There is nothing suspicious.

375
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Young Master Sun, Madam Qin.

376
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
My young master said that Madam Yan is not convenient to move.

377
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
I am afraid that she will be very angry.

378
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Madam Qin, my young master said that Madam Yan is not convenient to move.

379
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
He will protect Madam Yan.

380
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I will go and tell Big Brother.

381
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
What's wrong with you?

382
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I miss Brother Qi.

383
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
What about you?

384
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
He...

385
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Does he have something to do with him?

386
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,280
I used to think that I was very powerful.

387
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,280
But I can't even tell the difference between my feet and my heart.

388
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Am I particularly useless?

389
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
You mean this?

390
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Then what do you think I said?

391
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Nothing.

392
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,280
When I first gave people a doctor's appointment, I also felt that I was very powerful.

393
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
But even a small cold was treated wrong.

394
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
The doctor made mistakes first.

395
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
No one in this world will make mistakes.

396
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,280
It's just that the more you treat, the fewer mistakes you make.

397
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
You are the same. We are all talented.

398
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
I like to hear that.

399
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,280
When I mentioned Brother Qi, why are you blushing?

400
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
No.

401
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I am just moving.

402
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,280
If you say no, then no.

403
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Anyway, I really miss him.

404
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I miss him too.

405
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Bai Cao Yuan!

406
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Chu San!

407
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Chu San! Are you okay?

408
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm fine.

409
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Let me stay here for a while.

410
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Wan Er, I'm here.

411
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Wan Er!

412
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Hurry up!

413
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Hurry up!

414
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Okay, leave it to me.

415
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'll go.

416
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Fortunately, we found it in time.

417
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
The cold is not serious.

418
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm giving them a bath.

419
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
It's dangerous.

420
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
The Crown Prince and his men have been on the edge for many years.

421
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
They are on the road to the snowy land.

422
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
How can their bodies be damaged?

423
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Who knows?

424
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
If it wasn't for his human nature...

425
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Be careful.

426
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm fine.

427
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm afraid they will freeze to death at the gate.

428
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,280
His Highness is too tired and has damaged his vitality.

429
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
I'll go and get him some food.

430
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Fourth Prince soup.

431
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Senior Brother, His Highness has always been healthy and has a lot of blood.

432
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
It's not suitable to use the medicine for the body.

433
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Yes, it's because of human nature.

434
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
No wonder Master said I was dead.

435
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Master.

436
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
They are on the road and can't eat well.

437
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
They are cold and have a cold.

438
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
You can give them some warm cream.

439
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
The outer layer is cold and cold.

440
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
It will only hurt a little.

441
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Yes, I think so too.

442
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
I'll go and give him some cream.

443
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
In this aspect, you are not as good as me.

444
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
My wife, the medicine is ready.

445
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Please go and get me some sugar water.

446
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Don't need to be too thick.

447
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Just boil some rice oil and prepare it.

448
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Okay.

449
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Senior Brother, you go to General Bai's side.

450
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
What?

451
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
You want to give him the medicine yourself?

452
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Yes.

453
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
He is now in a deep slumber.

454
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
He will not marry anyone in the future.

455
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
How can a doctor distinguish between a man and a woman?

456
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Since there is no difference,

457
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
then you go to General Bai's side.

458
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
I'll do it.

459
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Why?

460
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
He...

461
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Last time I saw this boy,

462
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
he looked at you with a clear conscience.

463
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
What if he gets you involved?

464
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
He is a prince and he is involved in my affairs.

465
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Moreover, I have talked to him about taking off his clothes before.

466
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
He has been involved for a long time.

467
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
No, he...

468
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
He is now completely off.

469
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
If you are really worried,

470
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
I'll go to General Bai's side.

471
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
No, no, no.

472
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
He is also off.

473
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Since you have talked to him about it,

474
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
then let's do it like this.

475
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
I will definitely kill him.

476
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,280
I will definitely kill him.

477
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I will definitely kill him.

478
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,280
I will definitely kill him.

479
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I will definitely kill him.

480
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I will definitely kill him.

481
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,780
Here, look.

482
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,580
finding better than his way,

483
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,220
increase hisstop doing all those male and female works.

484
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,060
General Bai is all recover now.

485
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,880
Prince will be down to his health.

486
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,420
My lady!

487
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,780
Where are my clothes?

488
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,920
Take it off.

489
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,320
You're almost frozen.

490
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,000
Dafür кр Spiritual

491
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,480
Who took off that?

492
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,640
Myoloak.

493
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,960
OK, I got it.

494
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,200
I'm sorry.

495
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,800
Thank you.

496
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,520
Don't worry.

497
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,360
Just apply some more medicine.

498
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
Thank you, my lady.

499
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,520
I'm almost recovered.

500
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,200
You can take me to the harem after I change my clothes.

501
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,560
I'll decide whether it's good or not.

502
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,960
Lie down.

503
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,000
I'll apply the medicine.

504
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
Don't bother, my lady.

505
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,480
I'm fully recovered.

506
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,400
I'm fully recovered.

507
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,400
Lie down.

508
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,200
No need.

509
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,800
Shuzi.

510
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,720
Shuzi.

511
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,520
My lady.

512
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
Let me see your wound.

513
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,880
Don't wear pants.

514
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,880
I'm a playboy.

515
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,520
How can I ask you to punish me?

516
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,840
It's not the time to lose.

517
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,400
Get up.

518
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,960
If you don't punish me, I won't get up.

519
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,520
Who allowed you to get off the bed?

520
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,200
Go back.

521
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
We'll talk about it after you recover.

522
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,520
My lady.

523
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,480
My lady is more badly injured than me.

524
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,200
In order to improve your journey,

525
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,600
she stayed up all night to guard the harem.

526
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,520
She didn't even have a hot meal.

527
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,040
Shut up.

528
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,160
Shut up.

529
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,120
Say it.

530
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,200
Later, we found out that her wife was in the prairie.

531
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,600
She didn't even have a sip of water.

532
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,680
She was in a hurry to go up the mountain.

533
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,440
She had a rest at the gate of the house.

534
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,080
After that,

535
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,560
I fell asleep.

536
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,280
That's why she was in danger.

537
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,840
Your Highness.

538
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,920
It's all my fault.

539
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,640
I didn't think

540
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,000
the Central Plains was so cold.

541
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,560
What is your situation now?

542
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,400
I need some help.

543
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,800
Help you to go out and take one.

544
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,320
Master, let me take a look please.

545
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,320
You have a mouth?

546
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,400
ному婚 strawberry Most各osto a nut有點 because dù nếu,

547
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,280
we don't see anything and it's very difficult.

548
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,800
Your drunkard must be suffering for nothing.

549
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I'll go find my brother.

550
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,160
General Bai should take his medicine.

551
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
I'll go save him.

552
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
My lady.

553
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,000
The crown prince ran here so desperately.

554
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
What should we do in the future?

555
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,800
Fuling,

556
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,000
how should I accept this favor?

557
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,800
Is it in the past or in the future?

558
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
If my father's grievance can't be cleared,

559
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
how should I face him?

560
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,800
I'm afraid that I can't face him.

561
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I'm afraid that I can't face him.

562
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I'm afraid that I can't face him.

563
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
My lady.

564
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Fuling, stop talking.

565
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm so confused now.

566
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
My lady, the officials are here.

567
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Uncle Dong is taking them to see Song.

568
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Let's go.

569
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Steward Dong,

570
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
the medical skills of your doctor Sun

571
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
are known to revive.

572
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
What?

573
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
You didn't save him?

574
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Officer Song, you're joking.

575
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
When we came,

576
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
he was already dead.

577
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
He was already dead.

578
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
He was already dead.

579
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
He was already dead.

580
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
He was already dead.

581
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
After that,

582
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
he was already dead.

583
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
So,

584
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
look,

585
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
no matter how great a doctor is,

586
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
he always begs us.

587
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
It's a pity that

588
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
in the eyes of the doctor Sun,

589
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
there are no small interests like us.

590
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Look at what you said.

591
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Enough, enough.

592
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Let's check it.

593
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
It's almost done.

594
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
The people of the grassland

595
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
can't get ahead of the village.

596
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Most of them are their own people.

597
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Officer Song,

598
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
I've checked it.

599
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
The grassland

600
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
has no one to take revenge on the child.

601
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Madam Jiu,

602
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
don't go there yet.

603
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
The officer is checking the body.

604
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Okay.

605
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Tao, we've finished checking.

606
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
The victim

607
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
was stabbed to death by a man's chest.

608
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
Judging from the clothes on his body,

609
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
it's quite complete.

610
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
It's quite complete.

611
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
It's clear that he wasn't tortured that much.

612
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
The murderer

613
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
should be someone he knew.

614
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Look,

615
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
I've said it.

616
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
The case of acquaintance.

617
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Bring everyone in the yard

618
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
back to the yard to be interrogated.

619
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
After you're on the case,

620
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
you'll be punished.

621
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
As a constable,

622
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
you're investigating the case like this.

623
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Who are you?

624
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
The girl is not embroidering flowers in the house.

625
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Why are you here?

626
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
The case of the yard is being handled.

627
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Go, go, go.

628
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
You have no right to speak.

629
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Judging by the clothes on the body,

630
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
whether it's a mess,

631
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
it's a case of acquaintance.

632
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
How can a rough watchman

633
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
be a constable?

634
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
You insult a constable?

635
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I...

636
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
You dare?

637
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I dare.

638
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,800
This is the wife of the Marquis of Zhongyong.

639
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Marquis of Zhongyong?

640
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
I knew it.

641
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
No wonder the wife is so powerful.

642
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
But she's a lady of high rank.

643
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
She must know nothing about the case.

644
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
If the wife of the Marquis of Zhongyong doesn't know anything,

645
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I'm afraid that no one in this world

646
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
would dare to say a word about knowing.

647
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Who is it?

648
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
I gave you the token.

649
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Why don't you use it?

650
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
I didn't think about it for a moment.

651
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Take it out and try it.

652
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
The order of the Prince of Rui?

653
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
I have a problem.

654
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Please forgive me.

655
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
What kind of officer?

656
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
This is the Prince of Rui.

657
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
He's blind.

658
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
I don't think he's blind.

659
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Yes.

660
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
The wife of the Marquis of Qin is very good at making names.

661
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I especially hired her.

662
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,800
I'm glad to have her advice today.

663
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Get up.

664
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
It's my fault that I'm blind.

665
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Please forgive me.

666
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,800
The wife of the Marquis of Qin is loyal to the people.

667
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
She doesn't care about the criticism and helps me to find the good news.

668
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,800
You should respect her for the rest of your life.

669
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Mr. Jiu.

670
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Yes.

671
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,800
We pay our respects to Mr. Jiu.

672
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
You don't have to stand on ceremony.

673
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Fulin, the box.

674
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

675
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Brother, you send the Prince and General Bai to rest first.

676
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
No need.

677
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Bai Feng and I will go to the crime scene.

678
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
If there is anything wrong, we will inform you.

679
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
But your wound...

680
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
I'll give him some medicine.

681
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
As long as the medicine is taken, he should not die.

682
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
The murderer is not found.

683
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
The murderer may be killed again.

684
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,800
The reason for the autopsy is that the victim appeared in the yard at night.

685
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Yes, yes, yes.

686
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Did you get the murderer?

687
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Mr. Jiu, it's done.

688
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Okay.

689
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Go downstairs after you're done.

690
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Remember.

691
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Hurry, get the murderer.

692
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Yes.

693
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
There are scratches on the left cheek.

694
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
There are scratches on the right shoulder.

695
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
There are bruises and bruises on the chest.

696
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Knees and legs.

697
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
There are bruises and scratches on both hands.

698
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
There are scratches on both hands.

699
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
There is a blood stain on the right wrist.

700
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Where is the victim's clothes?

701
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Here, here, here.

702
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Dongshuo.

703
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,800
In the white grass garden, do the servants' winter clothes have this texture?

704
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I don't know.

705
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
I don't know.

706
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I don't know.

707
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
I don't know.

708
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
I don't know.

709
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't know.

710
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
I don't know.

711
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I don't know.

712
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
I don't know.

713
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I don't know.

714
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
I don't know.

715
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
I don't know.

716
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I don't know.

717
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
I don't know.

718
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I don't know.

719
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I don't know.

720
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
I don't know.

721
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
I don't know.

722
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I don't know.

723
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I don't know.

724
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
No, the hero always treats his servants well.

725
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
He never uses these thick cotton cloth as a dress.

726
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Where is the victim's shoe?

727
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Shoe.

728
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Mr. Jiu,

729
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
The victim's shoe is completely soaked with blood.

730
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
This is the room of the master.

731
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Master.

732
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Is there any clue on the left?

733
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Not far from here.

734
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
It's the clue for the servants.

735
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Let's go.

736
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Let's find the place where the dead met the criminals.

737
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Come on, master.

738
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Master.

739
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Where is the tour guide?

740
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
There's no sign on the map of Dongshu.

741
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
I'll go and have a look.

742
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Slow down.

743
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
It's not that far.

744
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Don't worry, master.

745
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Your Highness, the ninth lady has been dead.

746
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I brought the dead body to the prince.

747
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
Your Highness.

748
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Mr. Jiu asked me to bring the dead body.

749
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
It's not that far.

750
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Is there anyone protecting Mr. Jiu?

751
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Yes, I have arranged everything.

752
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,800
As long as I'm here, I won't let Mr. Jiu break a little oil.

753
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
The blood is dry.

754
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Master.

755
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Master.

756
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
The tour guide is a pharmacy.

757
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Although the door is locked, there are many medicines.

758
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
If we go any further, there are only a few crossroads.

759
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
That's a pharmacy.

760
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
If we go any further, it's the master's will.

761
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,800
The blood is dry.

762
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
It means the tour guide is the place where the dead met the criminals.

763
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
The map.

764
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
It's cold at night.

765
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:59,300
The dead may have to get up at night and go to the

766
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
KhongRE play60.

767
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:09,860
Chad

768
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,380
The trail people areENA's

769
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,300
I just lifestyle the conspiracy.

770
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
You are late.

771
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
That was the place where the victims met Dื.

772
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,020
We've been walking all the way here.

773
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,860
Besides the corridor, it's the path to the corpse.

774
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,100
The path is covered with smoke and smoke.

775
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,860
It's a good place to block the wind and snow.

776
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,340
That's why the dead man's blood is dry.

777
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,580
As for the famous weapon of Mr. Jiu,

778
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,420
it should be a weapon similar to a chisel.

779
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,980
Your Highness, this is the Wulong.

780
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,460
We never lock it.

781
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,260
After the chisel is done,

782
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,260
the little pinecone will put the chisel at the door.

783
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,140
That's the same.

784
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,420
The murderer entered the Wulong in the first step.

785
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,500
He took the chisel and waited for the dead man to follow him.

786
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,140
But if the murderer killed the dead man in the first step,

787
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,940
why would he be so cruel?

788
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,260
Maybe the murderer didn't kill in the first step.

789
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,460
But the person he wanted to kill

790
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,460
might not be the dead man.

791
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,380
Your Highness, you mean

792
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,020
the murderer's target is the Heart of Man.

793
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,700
He wanted to kill our young master.

794
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,580
I'm just guessing.

795
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,020
The accident of the dead man

796
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,620
disturbed the murderer's plan.

797
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,740
That's why he was killed.

798
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,740
Impossible.

799
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,580
Our young master tried to save people.

800
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,540
He gave the people medicine and a pillow.

801
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,980
No one would care about him.

802
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,780
Before he met the murderer,

803
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,460
he should have considered about everything.

804
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,060
But he's just a young man.

805
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,020
He's been acting strange since midnight.

806
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,460
How could he go to the front alone?

807
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,540
The little pinecone is kind-hearted.

808
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,220
He's the father of the young master.

809
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,380
If he found out the murderer's target is the Heart of Man,

810
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,700
he would follow him no matter how scared he is.

811
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,580
If it's really as I thought,

812
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,340
the priority is to protect young master Sun.

813
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,420
My Black Armor Guard will arrive in a few hours.

814
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,940
Chief Song,

815
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,740
you'll take care of the safety of the Heart of Man.

816
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,740
As you wish.

817
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Go, the Heart of Man.

818
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,780
Heart of Man

819
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,380
The snow is freezing

820
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,380
So cold, so warm

821
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:12,380
If a dust falls into the shadow

822
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:19,380
The snow falls, and my body is white

823
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:26,380
If a deep love is like a heartache

824
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,380
The pain will also be the same

825
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,380
Open your heart, love doesn't matter the deep sea

826
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:46,380
Please give me courage, let fate be open

827
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,380
Don't be afraid of the starlight being covered by the night sky

828
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:03,380
The stars will shine beyond the sky

829
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:13,380
The sky is like a dust, but it's the color of the starlight

830
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:43,380
The sky is like a dust, but it's the color of the starlight
