00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is the medicine for the bone marrow

8
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's hard to get it, only sold in Beijing

9
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You know the medicine only sold in Beijing?

10
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm a doctor, I like to know the medical information

11
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
According to the case, the thief is not only injured

12
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
His family is also very rich

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is the medicine strong?

14
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He has nothing to do with me

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He doesn't know the test result

18
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So he used the test to look for a long time

19
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He left the smell of the ointment

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can smell it

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't see anything

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't see anything

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I didn't see anything

24
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Stand still and talk

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
News from Beijing

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The son of the Wei family's eldest son Wei Qi Zhi is not injured by the horse

27
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But was broken by Duke Songguo's right leg and softened in the family

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is why his brother Wei Yan Zhi is the second person to leave the Song family

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wei Qi Zhi escaped from the Song family on the second day

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The person who pushed the tower and hurt me that day

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The leg is not changed

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Duke Songguo will do such a serious harm to the son of the Wei family?

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Unless Wei Qi Zhi made a big mistake

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If he is Song Rou's lover

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Song Rou's price is high

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He loves life and death

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,640
The

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But who is the person who played the ghost and scared me?

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Wei Qi Zhi's leg is not so flexible

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
His leg injury may not be the leg injury

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Only by finding him can you know the truth

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can rest assured to check again

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will let Bai Feng protect you

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I will go to meet Wei Yan Zhi now

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
See what he has to say

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Duke Songguo

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Not only is the daughter of the Zhao family not strict

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But also her own son

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The daughter of the Zhao family

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The daughter of the Zhao family

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The daughter of the Zhao family

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The daughter of the Zhao family

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
For a daughter that does not speak

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,720
And also sent his son

55
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Killing his mother

56
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Disbelieve the emperor

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,400
In such a situation

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I Akira of telegram

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Speak of how to insert the power

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We will decode the emperor

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Decode the national law

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you angry Duke Songguo?

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,480
My son was just Skilled and the son left and left

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,400
Wisdom

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
But only managed to smoke in violation of the Day of Killing

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,480
Not to cause trouble to하면

67
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
and become the laughing stock of the capital.

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,720
I am willing to take all the blame

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,320
and only ask to let go of all the people who sent the dowry.

70
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,000
It was me who made the decision to send the goods and the graves without permission.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
It has nothing to do with Wei Fuwei.

72
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,200
Wei Cheng.

73
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Song Rou's death is closely related to the person who sent the dowry.

74
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,240
You are so eager to destroy the city.

75
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,320
Is it to cover up the family's troubles

76
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,960
or to protect the person who sent the dowry?

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,440
I just...

78
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,920
You can't protect the eldest son anymore.

79
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Your Highness, Marquis,

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the person who secretly contacted my wife

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
is the eldest son, Wei Qi Zhi.

82
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,880
Do you have any evidence?

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
The eldest son admitted it himself.

84
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Madam found out that my wife was pregnant.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,480
She insisted on breaking off the private relationship with the eldest son.

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,120
That's why the Duke of Guo

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,480
broke the eldest son's leg.

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
No matter what the reason is,

89
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,600
it's a crime to set fire to the house.

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,640
Go to the government office and take a walk.

91
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,160
Take him away.

92
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,840
Go.

93
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Wei Fuwei,

94
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,040
did Wei Cheng say anything strange?

95
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,680
My brother and Rou have been very close since childhood.

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
So I didn't think much

97
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,040
until Duke of Song ordered me to send the dowry on behalf of my brother.

98
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,800
Then I found out that he and Rou

99
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,280
had made a big mistake.

100
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,440
You and Wei Qi Zhi are not a family.

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,760
But why do you have no idea about his background?

102
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Two years ago,

103
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,040
I went to the Xuanfang Camp with Duke of Song's grace.

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,360
After my brother and I had a big fight,

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
he refused to talk to me.

106
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,400
I really didn't know.

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,040
Why did you have a big fight?

108
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Because

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,560
my stepmother wanted my brother and Rou to marry each other.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,200
But Wei's family is poor.

111
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,040
They didn't get a chance to marry Duke of Song.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
My brother is very strong.

113
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,200
So he is distant from Duke of Song.

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,720
He doesn't want me to take advantage of it.

115
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,200
Wei Qi Zhi only uses his left hand.

116
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,440
Yes.

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,520
Because I heard that the left hand is not good for him.

118
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,960
So I forced my brother to use his right hand.

119
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,280
It's very human.

120
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,480
In order to protect my brother,

121
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,400
I lied to the Crown Prince.

122
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
I really shouldn't have done that.

123
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,240
You almost made a big mistake.

124
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm sorry for you.

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
After all,

126
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,000
Lady Song is from the capital of Jingzhou.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
Before the real murderer is caught,

128
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Wei Fuwei should be sent to the Eastern Courtyard.

129
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,360
Yep, I'm coming.

130
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,400
At last, they exposed the truth.

131
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
They say meat is food only,

132
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,880
and if it's completely rotten then it's considered slipping there.

133
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,900
Do you know how troublesome it is to get some meat here?

134
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,980
fish?

135
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,260
If the meat is impact or damaged only one,

136
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,240
you will definitely get pain.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,180
What are you talking about?

for the first time in my whole life!

151
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Meet吴indung if you hear only this.

152
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,240
How important is the content of the paper?

153
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,840
It's not necessarily important.

154
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,520
The members of the army sometimes destroy the unimportant information

155
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,680
in order to protect the source of the news.

156
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,640
The source of the news?

157
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,000
Different paper can reflect the habit of the writer.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,280
The handwriting on it is drawn by Wei Ye.

159
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,600
But the paper is extremely sharp.

160
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
It's not something ordinary people can buy.

161
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
My lady, is that shiny thing gold powder?

162
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
It's not as shiny as gold powder.

163
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It's gold dust.

164
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Gold dust is commonly used to make gold paint.

165
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
The gold paint is added to the wood and made into paper.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
It's the gold paint made from the gold powder.

167
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I know. I know the gold paint.

168
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,400
The paper has a faint smell of the paint.

169
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
It's even more fragrant than the gold powder.

170
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Ordinary nobles don't need gold powder.

171
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
They use the gold powder to write.

172
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,000
According to the news from the capital,

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Wei family is a poor family.

174
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Although the family is poor,

175
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
Wei's character is quite stubborn.

176
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,800
He likes to paint, so he has to learn how to paint.

177
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
He likes to ride a horse, so he has to tame a horse.

178
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
He likes porcelain, so all the porcelain is used by his family.

179
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
So, Ye Jinjian is quite suitable for his temperament.

180
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,400
The paper is only related to the criminal.

181
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,600
The brothers of the Wei family grew up together.

182
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
I want to see Wei Yanzhi to confirm.

183
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,400
It's said that Wei Yanzhi has a high fever and fell ill after returning.

184
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,200
It's hard for the Marquis to confirm.

185
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
It's hard for the Marquis to confirm.

186
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
If you want to see him,

187
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
you have to work hard to cure him.

188
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
Boss, two buns.

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Okay.

190
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Catch the thief!

191
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't run!

192
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Catch the thief!

193
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Catch the thief!

194
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,600
Where did he go?

195
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
Catch the thief!

196
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Catch the thief!

197
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll leave it to you.

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Okay.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thief!

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
You want to steal the Yan's Manor?

201
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Thanks to the Marquis' trick,

202
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,200
you can get rid of the fish.

203
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,800
You want us to do it ourselves?

204
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,000
Or you want to be punished?

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
Young Master, I...

206
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,000
Do I have a third choice?

207
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Please come in.

208
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,800
You have a high fever.

209
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,200
You don't have to be so polite.

210
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

211
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,800
Wei's father is seriously ill.

212
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Why are you still opening the window?

213
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,000
I just want to take a break.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
You're getting more and more serious.

215
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Is it because of the drug?

216
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you have a prescription?

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
It's on the table.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't worry, Wei's father.

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Jiu Niangzi is the doctor who saved the First Princess.

220
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
She came to treat you.

221
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,400
How dare she bother Jiu Niangzi?

222
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't worry, Wei's father.

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's a doctor's duty to cure and save people.

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Wei's father, please.

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
Did you take a cold shower today?

226
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,800
I came back too late that night.

227
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I couldn't wait to get hot water.

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,200
So I used a well.

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I couldn't wait to get hot water.

232
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
So I used a well.

233
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
The prescription is correct.

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,200
But you're tired and worried.

235
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,000
It's hard to sleep and sleep.

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
After all,

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm sorry for the Marquis.

238
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,400
I'm sorry for the little girl.

239
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Is this sword a famous sword?

241
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
You have a good eye.

242
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
Can you take off your clothes?

243
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
Wait.

244
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,800
This sword is a gift from Duke Song.

245
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm a man of my life.

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I never dare to write it.

247
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Please forgive me.

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
You love sword.

249
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Why do you want to forgive me?

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,400
You're so generous.

251
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm flattered.

252
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Wei,

253
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
you can change the room to a charcoal basin.

254
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
The high temperature is too hot.

255
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,400
It's not good for your health.

256
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,400
I'm cold at night.

257
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,400
I'll burn less in the daytime.

258
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Okay.

259
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
You don't need to change the prescription.

260
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,600
You can rest for a few days.

261
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Thank you.

262
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Thank you.

263
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
You should rest.

264
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Don't bother.

265
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
I'll change the room.

266
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,200
Good night.

267
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
The room is a bit hot but has a window.

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
And a strongravel expert.

269
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,200
There must be something wrong.

270
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
But properly devast light is a landmine.

271
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Why Duke Song is so nicer to Auf enca créd局?

272
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,880
Shakespeare Harry Potter

273
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,980
Xiaowan

274
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,720
What are you finding at the song Yellen'sタレ場.

275
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
A dirty dear returned that maid shamed to find it.

276
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,740
I said they do not know

277
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,280
All these to be checked?

278
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,120
Mistress

279
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,680
Wei Journal has been caught into prison.

280
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,600
Did he confess?

281
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Shang Wei, go to the House of Huo to punish him.

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,600
Ni, keep an eye on this meeting. No one is allowed to move.

283
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay.

284
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Let's go to the house.

285
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,400
Let's go.

286
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
Your Highness, Madam Jing.

287
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Wei Qi Zhi said that he sent Chang Sui and Wu Shu to steal the swallow.

288
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
The others refused to admit anything.

289
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,400
Their mouths are really tough.

290
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I refused to punish them.

291
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Without evidence, how could Master Huo punish them?

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Moreover, I haven't checked his leg.

293
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Where is he?

294
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Your Highness, the prison is so dirty.

295
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Please...

296
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
I'll punish you later.

297
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,600
The way the House of Huo punishes them is really impressive.

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Is Master Huo going to beat him?

299
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
He said he hurt his leg.

300
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,000
He wants to hit a snake with 7 inches.

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
That's why I gave him another chance.

302
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
But he still refused to confess.

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
His leg is broken.

304
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We don't know if he hurt his leg or not.

305
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Moreover, his leg is badly injured.

306
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
If he has a disability,

307
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
it will prove that he is innocent.

308
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,600
How are you going to explain it?

309
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
If he didn't mean to beat them,

310
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
why did he follow Song Rou to Jinzhou?

311
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
He was in the room on the day of the banquet.

312
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
If he stays there for one more day,

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,400
he must have killed them.

314
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,000
My Lord, you wronged me!

315
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
My Lord!

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Let him speak.

317
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,800
My Lord, my son is worried that

318
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
he can't hide the truth about Mrs. Song.

319
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
He is afraid that he will be punished by the House of Huo.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
That's why he dragged his leg.

321
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
When he arrived in Jinzhou,

322
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
he heard that Mrs. Song was dying.

323
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
That's why he ordered me to steal the banquet.

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
He just wanted to know how Mrs. Song died.

325
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
My son and Mrs. Song have no private relationship.

326
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
It's impossible to kill him.

327
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
My lords, you wronged me!

328
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
Don't talk nonsense.

329
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400
Wei Qi Zhi admitted it himself.

330
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,200
He has a private relationship with Song Rou.

331
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,800
My son loves Mrs. Song like his own sister.

332
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
How could he have a private relationship with her?

333
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,600
It's impossible to kill him.

334
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Wei Qi Zhi wrote with his left hand.

335
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
So what?

336
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
There are many people who can write with their left hand.

337
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
My son can do it too.

338
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Why did Wei Yanzhi write with his left hand?

339
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,600
My son was a senior in the junior high school.

340
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
My mother was worried that his left hand was not sharp.

341
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,600
So she forced my son to write with his right hand.

342
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,200
But my son is stubborn and unwilling to change his handwriting.

343
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,400
My mother was worried that my father was biased towards the number.

344
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,200
So she forced my son to write with his left hand to destroy his handwriting.

345
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
But my son was reluctant to do so because he was implicated.

346
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
So he changed his handwriting.

347
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
After he grew up,

348
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
his left hand is better than my son's.

349
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Why did Wei Qi Zhi only use porcelain?

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
My son doesn't only like porcelain.

351
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
He doesn't like the smell of porcelain.

352
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,200
He uses porcelain for many other materials.

353
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
That's why he used porcelain to write with his left hand.

354
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
I swear by my life,

355
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,000
my son was really wronged!

356
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,600
Sir Hua, please go and find a doctor for Wei Qi Zhi.

357
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm going now.

358
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
I didn't kill him.

359
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
It wasn't me.

360
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
I didn't kill him.

361
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
I didn't.

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't look for him.

363
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I can bring him here and interrogate him.

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
When we bring him to the Golden Leaves,

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
I don't believe he won't reveal his identity.

366
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
But there are still many evidences to prove his crime.

367
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
The testimony can only be used as evidence.

368
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
We can't prove that he is the murderer.

369
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
But if we investigate like this,

370
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
if the real murderer escaped,

371
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,800
wouldn't we lose all our money?

372
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,000
It's easy for the Crown Prince to commit a crime.

373
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,600
But it's also easy to destroy a person's life.

374
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
If you do something wrong, you will ruin a person's life.

375
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,200
You can't just ignore the law and be so strict.

376
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,200
This is also what Shen Yi, Shen Si Qing, said in Chongqing?

377
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Yes.

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,200
I'm done.

379
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Then please continue to organize the evidence.

380
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I will take care of the rest.

381
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

382
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
I have one more request.

383
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,400
Wei Qi Zhi,

384
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
considering your leg injury,

385
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,600
I will allow you to sit down and talk.

386
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Thank you for your consideration.

387
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,000
I will just stand here.

388
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Thank you.

389
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Wei Qi Zhi, I want to ask you.

390
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
How did your leg get injured?

391
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,200
It was broken by Duke Song two months ago in the capital.

392
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Then yesterday, you...

393
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Enough, enough.

394
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,600
I'm asking you, Duke Song,

395
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,800
why did he hit you so hard?

396
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,400
Because I admit that I have a private relationship with...

397
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,800
with Lady Song.

398
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,400
Then do you have a private relationship with Lady Song?

399
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,600
No.

400
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,200
Then why did you admit it?

401
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,800
Speak!

402
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,000
Rou's reputation is more important than my life.

403
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,800
If she says it's me, then it's me.

404
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
Wei Qi Zhi,

405
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Song Rou might have been killed by her lover.

406
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Are you willing to let the murderer go?

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,200
That day, Rou came to me crying.

408
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
She said she had a private relationship with someone else.

409
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
After Duke Song sent a message,

410
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
she said my name in a sudden.

411
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,800
Rou, say it!

412
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,000
I asked who she was.

413
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
She just cried and didn't say it.

414
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,000
At last, she forced me to admit it.

415
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Who is she?

416
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
I can't say it.

417
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,800
If someone else knows, she will ruin my future.

418
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,200
I really love her.

419
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,400
But in the next few days, Duke Song brought someone to find me.

420
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,600
He broke my engagement.

421
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
I had a problem with Duke Song.

422
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,800
I wanted to admit Rou's identity,

423
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
so I admitted it.

424
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I was at home getting a surgery.

425
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,600
I heard from my second brother that Duke Song didn't commit suicide.

426
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,800
So I asked him to explain.

427
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Until he left the capital,

428
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,800
the person he protected didn't show up.

429
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
What a coward!

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,800
How is it?

431
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,400
Young Master,

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
was Lady Song killed?

433
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Even her head was cut off?

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,200
I was afraid that person would kill her.

435
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
If I didn't find her,

436
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,200
she would be dead.

437
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
So I followed her to see if she was okay.

438
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,800
I heard this sound.

439
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
What are you doing?

440
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
Guards!

441
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Hold him!

442
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm sorry.

443
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
You are very kind.

444
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,960
I like the feeling of the form he used.

445
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,480
Your Majesty.

446
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,800
When Evidence of Spirit synthesis happen,

447
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,560
boy bandages liked so much

448
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,640
will arouse too much suits.

449
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,900
When bad,

450
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,640
cannibal blood able to hamper the disp landlord.

451
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,980
So,

452
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,740
it's said only white year of Mah- notable for this kind of fak sol diabetes.

453
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,380
You think that

454
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,980
who has gold ring.

455
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,780
Yes.

456
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,940
So the one who would rather swallow the gold ring

457
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,820
than her is definitely not her.

458
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,540
So,

459
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,580
the one who colluded with Miss Song

460
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,940
is someone else?

461
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,900
Yes.

462
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,700
I have a firm idea about the real murderer.

463
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,220
I guess the same goes for the ninth wife.

464
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,380
If you do it,

465
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,940
I will use the evidence

466
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
to prove that the murderer is innocent.

467
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,940
Wei,

468
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,340
where are you going in such a hurry?

469
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,780
Take him out!

470
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,980
Get the things out!

471
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,660
Yes.

472
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,420
Your eldest brother has been arrested.

473
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,060
You are innocent.

474
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,580
Why do you still want to escape?

475
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,780
I don't want to escape.

476
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,820
I just want to go back to the capital

477
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,620
and report this to my elders.

478
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,820
What?

479
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,460
I will be locked up in the Anyang Mansion forever?

480
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,460
You still won't let me touch it?

481
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,300
You can kill me or not.

482
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,420
The shadow is very important to me.

483
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,060
I can't touch anyone.

484
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,660
Did you hear that, Huo Zhi Fu?

485
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,220
Wei Fuwei admitted it himself.

486
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
Even I

487
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,900
can't touch his shadow sword.

488
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,620
I heard it very clearly.

489
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
That's good.

490
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
Bring it here.

491
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,220
Wei Yuan Zhi,

492
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,900
do you know what this is?

493
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,980
This is the gel that was left after burning the glue.

494
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,340
Although you broke your skull,

495
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
lit the incense,

496
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,780
and opened the window to change the air,

497
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,580
you forgot to clean the iron money.

498
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,780
Silver and double carbon

499
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,580
will not leave such a stain.

500
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,980
Take the evidence down.

501
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,780
Yes.

502
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,580
Your Highness, I found it.

503
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,780
Give it to the Ninth Madam.

504
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,740
It's true that he killed Song Liangzi.

505
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,580
That's where the trace of his skull comes from.

506
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,820
The corpse...

507
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,320
must have been stolen.

508
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:40,360
I don't know he killed Song Finally the Pleiade

509
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,060
He killed maidservant Song

510
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,340
According to charts

511
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,860
He stabbed只是 by his bones

512
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,860
If you want to escape, do you have anything to say?

513
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,860
The people of Xiong Xiong took the dead body

514
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,860
and disguised the wedding dress as a crime scene.

515
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Then they put the body of the dead person in the wedding dress

516
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,860
and put it in the wedding dress.

517
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,860
To stop the death of the nine-haired woman,

518
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
you pretended to be a woman and threatened her.

519
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,860
And you tried to use the ink on the wedding dress

520
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,860
to frame your own enemy, Wei Qizhi.

521
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
To make Wei Qizhi's crime,

522
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
you eliminated me, the one who is a liar.

523
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,860
You made your loyal guard Wei Cheng disguise as Wei Qizhi

524
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,860
and assassinate me in the lantern meeting.

525
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
When you found out that the assassination failed,

526
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
there was no way to steal the body and examine it.

527
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,860
You called Wei Cheng to burn the clothes overnight

528
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
and tried to destroy the body again.

529
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,860
You even made a big fire to burn the dead person's head.

530
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Now, the evidence is all here.

531
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,860
The perpetrator who killed the dead person is Wei Yanzhi.

532
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
You are just a crazy man.

533
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,860
The evidence is solid. What else do you have to say?

534
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
I am a crazy man.

535
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,860
It's that woman who is crazy.

536
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,860
She has such a good marriage with Marquis Anyang.

537
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
Why does she want to get involved with me

538
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,860
and force me to elope with her?

539
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
My brother is the legitimate son.

540
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
He broke up with her so easily.

541
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
If it were me,

542
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
I would have killed him.

543
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
I would have killed him.

544
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
But I'm afraid that I can't protect him.

545
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Do you know what will happen to the Duke?

546
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
My brother.

547
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
You finally come to take me away.

548
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Why did you come out in a wedding dress?

549
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
If someone sees you,

550
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
we will be dead.

551
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
I'm just in a hurry to see you.

552
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Don't worry. I have already sent Momo away.

553
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
She won't find out.

554
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Did you take the surgery I gave you?

555
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm afraid that Momo saw it and took it secretly.

556
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
You...

557
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Why?

558
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,860
It's uncomfortable to take it secretly.

559
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
For you,

560
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

561
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Erlang, take me away tonight.

562
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,860
I'd rather die than let another man touch me.

563
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Except you,

564
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I won't marry anyone in this life.

565
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,860
I want to be with you forever.

566
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
Don't think like that.

567
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
I will be heartbroken.

568
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
Let's go tonight.

569
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,860
Go far away.

570
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Wherever you want to go, we will go.

571
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
As long as you are willing,

572
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
I will love you forever.

573
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
Love you,

574
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
and be with you.

575
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
We will be together forever.

576
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,960
I love you,

577
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,860
I love you forever.

578
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Love you forever.

579
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,860
I'm willing to be your wife for the rest of my life.

580
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,860
I'm willing to be your wife for the rest of my life.

581
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
My dear husband.

582
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
But...

583
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
I don't want to.

584
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm willing to be your wife for the rest of my life.

585
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
She abandoned Rong Hua and Fu Gui for you.

586
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
But you killed her for your own selfish reason.

587
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
Why should I?

588
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,860
This stupid bitch wants to ruin my life with love.

589
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
She's innocent.

590
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm innocent.

591
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
The woman you're talking about is Song Rong.

592
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
She's the biggest idiot in this life.

593
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,860
She used all her intelligence to protect you.

594
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,860
If she didn't swallow you to kill her,

595
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
you would have been punished.

596
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
You're the only one who's really innocent

597
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
for killing the woman who loves you.

598
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
So what?

599
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,860
As long as I don't love her,

600
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
even if she dies for me,

601
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
it's all wrong.

602
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
It's all wrong!

603
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Song Rong!

604
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,860
If Song Rong knew that

605
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
someone else cares about her so much,

606
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
it's not a good thing.

607
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Without you,

608
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
no one can save her.

609
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
Xue He.

610
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,860
The case has been solved.

611
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,860
Now we can repair Song Rong's body.

612
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
My lady, I don't understand.

613
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
The case has been solved.

614
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Why do we need to repair her body?

615
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
We can return her body to her family.

616
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,860
If no one cares, we can bury her body in the mountain.

617
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
It's a great loss.

618
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
The death is a miserable thing.

619
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
The dead used their body

620
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
to expose the truth for us.

621
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,860
We should pay back the dignity of her ex-fiance.

622
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
My lady.

623
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Why didn't you care about the dead

624
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
and call her your lady?

625
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
Because from now on,

626
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
I don't need to see her as a evidence.

627
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I can do nothing

628
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
to see her off.

629
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
The wind blows in the sky

630
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
The sky is clear

631
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
The wind blows in the sky

632
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
The sky is clear

633
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
The sky is clear

634
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
The sky is clear

635
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
The sky is clear

636
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,860
The sky is clear

637
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,860
The sky is clear

638
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,860
The sky is clear

639
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,860
The sky is clear

640
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
The sky is clear

641
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
The sky is clear

642
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,860
The sky is clear

643
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,860
The sky is clear

644
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
The sky is clear

645
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
The sky is clear

646
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
The sky is clear

647
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,860
My lady.

648
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,860
If my body

649
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Queen goosebumps

650
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
You厲害

651
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
You horrible

652
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,860
You horrible

653
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,860
You horrible

654
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,860
You horrible

655
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,860
The wind and rain are like ashes

656
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,860
The memory is like a memory

657
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,860
The sword and the sword

658
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,860
The heart is like a heart

659
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:13,860
The wind and rain are like ashes

660
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:20,860
How can I?

661
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:28,860
The wind and rain are like ashes

662
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:35,860
How can I?

663
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,860
Thank you

664
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,860
The wind and rain are like ashes

665
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
This is the kungfu of a incense

666
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Don't forget

667
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
I understand

668
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
What are you doing here?

669
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
To laugh at me for your mother

670
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Yan Zhi

671
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I just want to ask you

672
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Rou'er has a deep love for you

673
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
She is pregnant with your child

674
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
I am not pregnant

675
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
I am not pregnant

676
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
I am not pregnant

677
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
I am not pregnant

678
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I am not pregnant

679
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I am not pregnant

680
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
I am not pregnant

681
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,860
Do you still love your child?

682
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
You want to punish me for her?

683
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Have you no sense of patriotism till now?

684
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Why do you punish me?

685
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Because I am your brother

686
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
I am not your brother

687
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,860
You are the son of the Wei family

688
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,640
I knew everything aboutp obviously

689
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:06,140
In the past, youquila became a

690
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,300
I realized that

691
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,160
As long as family union comes to robbed

692
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,240
I would not become the excessive

693
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,000
Me?

694
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,360
Your mother only let you learn

695
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,240
If not, how could I secretly learn from Xiaorou?

696
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,600
How could I fall into this world?

697
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,760
So you hate me so much

698
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,040
I'm sorry

699
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,720
Don't pretend to be sad

700
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,720
I've been with you for so many years

701
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
I've had enough

702
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
You go

703
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
No matter what you think

704
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I have no regrets about you

705
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Today is over

706
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,720
I hope you can also

707
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Recover in the next life

708
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm sorry

709
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Miss Song is so pitiful

710
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
If not for the chief princess and Mr. Wei

711
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
No one would care about the future

712
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Mr. Wei insisted to bury her in Jinzhou

713
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,720
It seems that he is completely disappointed with the Song family

714
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Maybe it's because he knows too much

715
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,720
So he chose to do this

716
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
With the character of the Song family

717
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Even if Miss Song goes back

718
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I guess she can't get into the family

719
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
It's better to bury her here

720
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
Clear mountains and water

721
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Recover in the next life

722
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
I feel so scared when I think about this

723
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
A woman is too infatuated

724
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
She is in danger of killing herself

725
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Her father

726
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
For the sake of the family's reputation

727
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
She doesn't even care about the family's future

728
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
She can't even go back to the roots

729
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
What do these men do?

730
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
It has nothing to do with men and women

731
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
Whether it's Duke Song or Wei Yanzhi

732
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,720
They are all selfish people

733
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
It seems that as women

734
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
It's better to be heartless and safe

735
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Master, the case is settled

736
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,720
