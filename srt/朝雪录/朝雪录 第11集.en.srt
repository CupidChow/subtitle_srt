00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,229
Sorry, Wan.

4
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,259
You're too clever for your own good.

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,560
Chen, don't make another mistake.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
I've never made any mistake.

7
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,550
Stop!

8
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,150
Spare his life.

9
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,550
Wanxing?

10
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm Yingqi
under the Young Marshal's command.

11
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,460
Sorry I'm late.

12
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,350
Please punish me, Miss Qin.

13
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,670
Fire!

14
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,350
The ancestral hall is on fire!

15
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,240
The ancestral hall?

16
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,320
Madam Qin is still inside!

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh, no.

Put out the fire. Over there!

Sir,

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,920
there's tung oil all
over the ancestral hall.

35

Water won't help!

36
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,440
What's the point of saying that?

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,230
Think of something!

38
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes.

39
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Caihe!

Why aren't you saving people?

43
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,950
The fire's too big now.

44
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,550
We can't get in.

45

Qin An, a monster,

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,410
tortured my little sister,

47
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,190
humiliated my mother,

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,280
burned my father alive,

49
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,500
and made me homeless.

and aided the fiends!

55
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,400

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,730
has a vicious heart behind a kind face.

57
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,280
I, Yang Caihe, have served
this family for five years.

58

Only today do I finally get to
avenge this blood feud!

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,670
I want Qin An to watch his bloodline end

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,870
with his own eyes.

61

Caihe tricked her into coming.

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,110
Please save her!

70
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,970
She's carrying your child!

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,040
Untie me!

74
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,710
Xinlan is still in there.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,670
She's about to give birth.

76
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,000
My unborn grandson!

77
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,790
My grandson!

78
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,400
What do we do now?

79
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,080
Xinlan!

80
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,040
Chen! Chen!

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,880
Go help Chen!

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,450
Someone help!

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
Is anyone there?

84
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,350
Qin Wan.

85
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,840
Put out the fire!

86
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,920
Chen!

87
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,280
Qin Chen did that to you?

88
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,310
I'm fine. Don't worry.

89
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,190
Put the fire out first!

90
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,040
Xinlan is still in there.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,080
She's pregnant.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,400
If she doesn't get out soon,

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,990
I'm afraid...

94
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,850
Little Wan'er!

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,870
Little Wan'er, are you alright?

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm fine.

97
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,750
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,990
We heard the Qin Mansion caught fire.

99
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,110
Grandma was worried sick.

100
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,570
She sent me to check on her.

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,840
Xinlan!

102
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,890

103

H-Hurry.

I'll untie you now.

107
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,160
Save Xinlan and the baby.

108
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,520
Xinlan! Xinlan!

109
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,920
Xinlan, how are you?

110
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,400
My belly...

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,010
I'm afraid we'll lose the baby.

112
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,659
S-Save the baby.

113
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,520
Grandma, wait for me.

114
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,680
Xinlan,

115

Young Madam gave birth!

198
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,610
Boy or girl?

199
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,470
It's a girl.

200
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,160
Really?

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,770
Let's go take a look!

202
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,410
Let's go.

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,280
Shuang,

204
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,240
let's head back.

205
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,450
We're not in the best state today.

We'll properly entertain
Your Ladyship another day.

207
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,990
Mother,

208
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,900
aren't you going to see the baby?

209
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,090
She's all that Chen left behind.

210
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,710
What's there to see?

211
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,100
Just a girl.

212
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,790
Let's go, Mother.

213
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,810
What's wrong with a girl?

214
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,410
She's still a Qin.

215
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,650
What's wrong with the Qin family?

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Xinlan,

217
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,860
you heard it all.

218
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,960
If you take your own life,

219
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,670
the baby

220
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,090
will be left alone
to face this cold family.

221
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,280
There's no telling
if she'll even grow up safely.

222
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,990
Can you really bear
to leave her to such a fate?

223
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,660
I'll go back to my parents' house
with my daughter

224
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,850
and never set foot
in this filthy place again.

225
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,190
Qin Chen seemed

226
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,650
like a refined gentleman.

227
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,470
Who would've thought
he'd do something like that?

228
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,060
He killed three people.

229
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,150
I thought he'd already lost all humanity,

230
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,980
but in the end, he chose

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,660
to save his wife and kid first.

232
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,820
People are complicated.

233
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,070
Caihe was a victim at first,

234
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
yet in the end,
she became a cruel murderer.

235
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,640
Qin Chen killed
his own father for his lover,

236
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,800
yet still cared for his wife and child.

237
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,420
Now that they've both
perished in the flames,

238
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,430
it's even harder
to sort out all the feelings

239
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,760
they had for each other.

240
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,610
What happened
with the Qin family was just nuts.

241
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,990
No wonder neither of you had time for me.

242
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,520
But with both the ringleader
and the accomplice dead,

243
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,550
this case can finally be closed.

244
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,830
So Little Wan'er, do you have time

245
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,090
to hang out with me now?

246
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,310
The Qin family's future is grim,

247
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,790
which will inevitably affect her.

248
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,190
She's not in the mood for that.

249
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,790
What's there to worry about?

250
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,160
Why don't you move in with me?

251
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,880
I could even help you solve cases.

252
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,340
Thank you, Your Ladyship,

253
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,400
but with the Qin family's
reputation in ruins,

254
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,040
I can't drag you down
and let people gossip about you.

255
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,070
I'm not afraid.

256
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,950
If anyone dares gossip about you,

257
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,410
I'll...

258
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,140
I'll whip them myself.

259
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,950
Miss Qin,

260
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,700
if the Qin family falls from grace,

261
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
have you thought about
what you'll do next?

262
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,000
I haven't given it much thought yet.

263
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,510
After I join the Ministry of Justice,

264
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,100
will you come
to the capital to help me?

265
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,530
With postmortems?

266
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,070
Can I participate
in all kinds of cases, big and small?

267
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,790
As long as it's within my reach,

268
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,790
I'll let you join.

269
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,970
I'd love that.

270
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,400
Awesome! I'm going too!

271
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,760
Come with me.

272
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,470
Chi.

273
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,550
All you ever do is eat

274
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,170
and play around.

275
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,710
You do know you're a nuisance, don't you?

276
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,540
Why are you gripping me so hard?

277
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,910
[Grace and Purity]

278
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,110
My Lady,

279
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,370
you shouldn't have readily agreed

280
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,830
to go to the capital
with His Highness today.

281
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,670
Why not?

282
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,890
He's going to work
at the Ministry of Justice.

283
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,910
With his help,

284
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,550
not only can I examine bodies

285
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,960
openly and legitimately,

286
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,280
but I can also visit
the Ministry of Justice

287
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,360
and look for a chance
to clear my father's name.

288
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,520
How could I miss

289
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,780
such a good opportunity?

290
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,060
But you're unmarried.

291
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,280
You agreed so fast to go to the capital
with an unrelated man.

292
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,210
Aren't you afraid
His Highness will get suspicious?

293
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,710
The other day, you mentioned

294
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,170
Minister Shen Yi's "Vindication Records."

295
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,330
I found a copy of it and read it.

296
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,140
Turns out Minister Shen

297
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,120
could see the truth
from the smallest clues.

298
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,300
He was a great official of his time.

299
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,710
How did you know the girl
wearing the xiezhi mask was me?

300
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,270
The xiezhi can tell right from wrong.

301
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,079
In this world,

302
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,560
what other woman would wear

303
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,160
such a fierce-looking mask?

304
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,260
He must have noticed something.

305
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,119
Then why did you…

306
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,880
I've seen the scars on his body.

307
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,119
He got some of them after he left Shuoxi.

308
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,579
Apart from foreign enemies,

309
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,079
he must have plenty of foes in Zhou

310
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,270
who want him dead too.

311
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,270
He gave up his powerful position
as the Young Marshal of Shuoxi,

312
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,270
insisted on joining
the Ministry of Justice,

313
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,930
and kept trying to win me over.

314
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,920
He must have his plans.

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,800
Regardless of his intentions,

316
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,120
since he dares to work with me,

317
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,270
and it benefits me,

318
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,640
why should I hold back?

319
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,090
I never expected that
someone as noble as the Heir of Prince Rui

320
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,030
would also have worries
he can't talk about.

321
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,290
When Father was alive,

322
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,330
he helped hundreds of friends
and subordinates.

323
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,140
Yet when he was falsely accused,

324
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,380
only His Highness

325
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,900
still praised him,

326
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,130
calling him a great official.

327
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,130
Whether he meant to test me or not,

328
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,100
the fact that he said it

329
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,200
is enough of a gesture of goodwill.

330
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,990
His Highness is a good man.

331
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,980
My Lady,

332
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,940
why don't we just
tell His Highness the truth

333
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,890
about Master's case?

334
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,480
No.

335
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,310
Lord Yan is Prince Jin's cousin,

336
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,170
and Father's case

337
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,600
is closely related to Prince Jin's death.

338
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,710
For now,

339
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,450
Lord Yan and I
can still serve each other's interests,

340
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,150
but when the truth comes to light,

341
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,990
whether we'll end up
as friends or foes is yet to be seen.

342
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,290
So whether he suspects my identity or not,

343
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,090
as long as he has no proof,

344
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,730
we cannot admit anything.

345
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,910
Qin An

346
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,710
violated human ethics

347
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,440
and defied the moral order.

348
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,320
Qin Chen and the maid Caihe
committed adultery

349
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,720
and took innocent lives.

350
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,280
By law, all assets must be confiscated.

351
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,260
Anyone found hiding property

352
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,320
shall be punished as a thief!

353
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,560
Yes!

[Qin Mansion]

355
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,300
Your Highness.

356
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,380
Wan.

357
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,800
Wan.

358
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,330
Could you please beg His Highness

359
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,400
to at least leave us some money
to survive on?

360
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,600
Otherwise,

361
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,750
with all three of you unmarried,

362
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,010
how are we supposed to go on living?

363
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,710
Mother, why are you asking her for help?

364
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,840
She's the reason we ended up like this.

365
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,820
If you hadn't meddled,

366
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,700
how could Grandma and Chen
have died so tragically?

367
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,510
Aunt,

368
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,190
when those women begged for their lives,

369
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,490
did anyone from the Qin family show mercy?

370
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,250
Now,

371
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,380
what right do we have to beg for money?

372
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,290
Your Highness,

373
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,710
I thank you on behalf of the families

374
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,830
of the victims.

375
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,210
It's thanks to you

376
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,420
that their grievances have been redressed.

377
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,820
You're the last person
who should thank me.

378
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,130
I have one more request.

379
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,710
Go ahead.

380
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,340
Xinlan is weak after childbirth.

381
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,500
She and the baby
can't handle any more stress.

382
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,400
Could you please…

383
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Rest assured.

384
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,470
We'll leave the Linfeng House alone

385
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,600
until she moves out.

386
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,780
As for the others…

387
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,890
no matter who pleads for them,

388
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,920
they won't escape punishment!

389
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,710
Mother, let's go.

390
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,080
Thank you for your consideration.

391
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,160
Don't smile.

392
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,610
They might see you.

393
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,930
Sorry.

394
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,710
So adorable.

395
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,030
My Lady, the carriage is ready.

396
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,220
Ma'am.

397
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,640
This is for treating postpartum weakness.

398
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,370
Make sure Xinlan takes it on the road.

399
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,840
There are also several prescriptions
for regulating the organs.

400
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,470
Just follow my instructions
to prepare the decoction.

401
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,270
Miss Qin, thanks to your help,

402
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,720
Ms. Yao can now set her mind at ease

403
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,170
and return to her parents' house
with the baby.

404
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,410
Miss Qin, I thank you
on behalf of her parents.

405
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,200
Xinlan is still weak.

406
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,450
Please don't do this.

407
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,380
Let's go.

408
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,930
Move.

409
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,370
Today is the deadline.

410
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,220
That third aunt of yours

411
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
refused to leave,

412
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,640
begging me tearfully
to speak to Chi on her behalf.

413
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
I'm not helping her.

414
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,270
Third Madam is so cruel.

415
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Even if she resents you for leaving,

416
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,700
the baby is still her granddaughter.

417
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,780
She didn't even ask
a single word about her.

418
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,900
That's better.

419
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,190
From this day forward,

420
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,230
my daughter will have nothing more to do

421
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,560
with this filthy place.

422
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,430
You're so magnanimous, Xinlan.

423
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,290
Things will turn out well for you.

424
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,490
After we part today,

425
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,930
we may never meet again.

426
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,080
Wan, you're talented and virtuous,

427
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,080
deserving to be cherished
by the best man in the world.

428
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,780
All I wish for you

429
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,120
is to find a good match

430
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,710
to live a happy life with him.

431
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,770
Thank you, Xinlan.

432
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,130
But I wish

433
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,980
all women in the world
could cherish themselves

434
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,600
without needing a man's love
to feel worthy.

435
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,320
That's so true, Little Wan'er.

436
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,180
That's exactly what I think too.

437
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,640
Wan, you're so free-spirited.

438
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,710
I'm not even close.

439
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,950
What parents should give their children

440
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,360
isn't just blood ties,

441
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,210
but love

442
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,310
and education.

443
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,430
If Madam Qin had raised Qin An better,

444
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,930
and if Qin An had loved Qin Chen properly,

445
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,470
the third branch of the Qin family
wouldn't have ended up like this.

446
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,530
If I had been Caihe,

447
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,590
I would've killed Qin An and Liu Chun—

448
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,270
quick and satisfying.

449
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,260
I wouldn't have hurt
so many innocent people.

450
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,410
If I had been her,

451
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,510
I would've done everything
to find evidence of their crimes

452
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,120
and bring them to justice

453
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,380
as a warning to others.

454
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,750
I'd have made their crimes known to all

455
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,950
so they'd be despised for generations.

456
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,800
Little Wan'er, you're even more ruthless.

457
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Alright.

458
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,920
Let's not talk about
the depressing stuff.

459
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,580
Grandma misses you terribly.

460
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,780
Why don't you just move in with us?

461
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,950
After everything that's happened,

462
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,550
your aunt will surely
make things hard for you.

463
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,580
I sought refuge with the third branch.

464
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,710
If I move into the Marquis Mansion now,

465
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,770
wouldn't that make me an ingrate?

466
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,380
Don't worry. Once all this is over,

467
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,910
I'll definitely visit the Grand Princess.

468
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,450
Then come as soon as you can.

469
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,640
You may not have noticed it,

470
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,750
but in my family, it's not just my grandma

471
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,750
who misses you.

Master.

475
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,600
Those from the pawnshop are tight-lipped.

476
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,030
We tried everything,
but they still wouldn't talk.

477
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,680
By the way,

478
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,730
it seems they exchanged letters
with someone in the capital.

479
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,710
But the letters were burned
during the arrest.

480
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,040
Whoever's backing them
must be powerful.

Let the bookkeeper go.

482
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,800

483
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,330
to lure out the mastermind?

484
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,120

Uncle, calm down.

488
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,820
If your father hadn't

489
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,270
sent me a secret letter
to tell me about the attack,

490
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,730
how long were you planning
to keep it from me?

491
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,810
Father and I have long
been thorns in someone's side.

492
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,580
Why should we drag you into this mess?

493
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,360
Besides, the mastermind is still unknown,

494
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,830
and Father wasn't seriously injured,

495
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,320
so it's best not to make a fuss.

496
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,030
Nonsense!

497
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,950
Your father and I had fought

499
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,950
Since when do I need your protection?

500
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,430
Yes.

501
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,860
Uncle, you've always been cautious.

502
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,820
You and my father
once risked your lives side by side.

503
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,580
Of course you're not afraid
of those scoundrels.

504
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,660

can you bear to put Great Aunt

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,230
in danger as well?

507
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,160
You've probably figured it out by now—

508
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,890
those behind the attacks
on my father and me

509
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,260
are from the capital.

510
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm returning to the capital

511
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,950
precisely to settle this matter.

512
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,750
If I need help,

513
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,350
I'll definitely come to you.

514
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,180
But please,

515
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,710
talk to my father

516
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,020
when you can.

517
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,650
Tell him to play it safe

518
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,560
and prevent internal unrest.

519
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,040
The year's almost over.

520
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,030
When are you going back to the capital?

521
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,560
As soon as the Qingyuan Pawnshop case
is wrapped up.

522
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,490
His Majesty

523
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,010
ordered me to inspect the criminal cases
in different prefectures.

524
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,540
I have to do my job properly.

525
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,100
I really don't understand.

526
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,330
With your military achievements,

527
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,930
joining the Ministry of War
would be a natural progression.

528
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,560
Why do you have to
get involved in Prince Jin's case?

529
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,080
His death was suspicious.

530
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,190
I can't just look the other way.

531
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,960
I know you and Prince Jin
were as close as brothers,

532
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,870
but his case involves palace secrets.

533
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,190
No one at court dares speak up.

534
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
As the Heir of Prince Rui,
you're supposed

535
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,230
to guard the border,
not to jump into this mess.

536
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,230
Don't you realize

537
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,640
one wrong step

538
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,770
could ruin everything?

539
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,720
Uncle,

540
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,610
several months ago,

541
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,430
I secretly entered the capital

542
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,360
to investigate Prince Jin's case.

543
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,160
While passing through Jingzhou,

544
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,560
I was attacked, and so was my father
who was far away at Shuoxi.

545
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,920
Your father

546
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,640
never told me about this.

547
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,640
He doesn't know yet.

548
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
But with thousands of miles between us,

549
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,390
who could've orchestrated such attacks

550
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,450
to kill both of us?

551
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,480
Weren't they afraid
it'd unsettle the troops

552
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
and destabilize the border?

553
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,360
Are you suspecting

554
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,010
that Prince Jin's case

555
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,190
is connected
to the one behind the attacks?

556
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,120
It's hard to say.

557
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,840
But among those coveting the Shuoxi Army,

558
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,770
many are aware of my bond

559
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,380
with Prince Jin.

560
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,500
But Prince Jin's death
has been ruled as suicide out of guilt.

561
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,670
Even a high-ranking official like Shen Yi

562
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,670
was executed along with his entire family.

563
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,330
You're new to criminal cases.

564
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,240
What can you possibly do
in the Ministry of Justice?

565
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,570
As "The Art of War" says,

566
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,860
if you only know yourself
but not your enemy,

567
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,420
you'll win some and lose some.

568
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,950
With the support I have now,

569
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,270
my chances are at least even.

570
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,600
My Lady,

571
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,810
we're running low
on the herbs for His Highness.

572
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,600
Since we're moving to

573
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,320
the estate that came with
Third Madam's dowry,

574
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,920
we can buy some along the way.

575
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,610
His Highness isn't returning to Shuoxi,

576
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,950
so I don't think he'll need

577
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,890
so much medicine.

578
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,160
My Lady,

579
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
your savings are almost depleted.

580
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,640
If you take the job, you see it done.

581
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,020
Money can be earned again,

582
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,880
but one must not break their word.

583
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,290
What herbs do you need?

584
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,380
Your Highness, I didn't hear you coming.

585
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,250
The government runners said
you two haven't left yet.

586
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,580
Miss Qin,
I'd like to speak with you alone.

587
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Your Highness, is it about Wanxing?

588
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,260
I mean, Yingqi.

589
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,680
Yingqi is a secret guard
from the Dove Unit.

590
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,880
She's an elite bodyguard and spy.

591
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,270
I was worried someone
in the Qin family might harm you.

592
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,190
I didn't send her here

593
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,460
to keep tabs on you.

594
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,270
You don't need to explain, Your Highness.

595
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,060
You sent Yingqi to me,

596
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,330
but she followed my orders
and left when I told her to.

597
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,990
That means you told her
to treat me as her master.

598
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,230
So of course I believe
you meant to protect me.

599
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,960
You really are sharp, Miss Qin.

600
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,110
There's something

601
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,950
I'd like to ask you about.

602
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,880
Go ahead.

603
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,080
Do you know why

604
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,600
Minister Shen Yi

605
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,870
was executed
along with his whole family?

606
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Why did you bring him up so suddenly,

607
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,640
Your Highness?

608
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,400
Miss Qin, do you know

609
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,180
what crime Prince Jin was accused of?

610
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,130
I lived in the valley for so long

611
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,860
and know nothing of
what happened in the capital.

612
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,010
Prince Jin was His Majesty's eldest son,

613
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,320
noble in character, pure as gold and jade.

614
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,880
Though his mother's rank wasn't high,

615
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,800
he was deeply loved by His Majesty.

616
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,710
Rumor had it

617
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,800
that at a palace banquet,

618
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,400
Prince Jin got drunk,
barged into the inner palace,

619
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,860
tried to rape Consort Jin,

620
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,840
His Majesty's favorite woman,

621
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,500
and killed her when it failed.

622
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,230
The palace is heavily guarded.

623
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,600
How could he have possibly broken in

624
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,190
and done something so horrible?

625
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,990
It was precisely why Minister Shen Yi

626
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,920
insisted Prince Jin was innocent.

627
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,340
For that, he was convicted
of misconduct,

628
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
and his entire family was executed.

629
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,320
After that, Prince Jin supposedly
killed himself in prison out of guilt.

630
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,230
Could it be that

631
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,050
Father knew
Prince Jin's case would end badly

632
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,650
and sent me away to escape it?

633
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,800
Minister Shen was a righteous official.

634
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,190
He wouldn't have
defended Prince Jin without cause.

635
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,190
And I know Prince Jin too well—

636
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,910
he appeared easy-going but had principles.

637
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,840
There's no way
he'd have forced himself on anyone,

638
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
let alone kill himself out of guilt.

639
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,090
Your Highness,

640
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
why are you telling me
all these imperial secrets?

641
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,760
Prince Jin was like
a brother and a father to me.

642
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,410
And you respected
Minister Shen as a mentor.

643
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,720
After we arrive in the capital,

644
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,060
please help me

645
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
clear Prince Jin's name

646
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,300
and vindicate Minister Shen Yi.

647
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,340
You want to vindicate Minister Shen too?

648
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,510
A man as upright as Minister Shen

649
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,310
shouldn't have died
because of false charges.

650
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,890
But you know how dangerous this path is.

651
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,620
If we work together,

652
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,010
no matter how tough it gets,

653
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
there's nothing to fear.

654
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,670
Okay.

655
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,160
You have my word.

656
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,350
Master, did Miss Qin agree?

657
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,670
Of course she did.

658
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,930
Now that Yingqi's gone,

659
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,710
you'll be on night duty from now on.

660
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,230
Okay.

661
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,690
But

662
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,910
who will follow you during the day?

663
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,700
You will.

664
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,780
Wait, Master.

665
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,800
I'll die from overwork like this.

666
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,410
[Baozhi Pharmacy]

667
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,510
Miss, don't worry.

668
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,080
All the herbs in my shop are top quality.

669
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,880
Who's it?

670
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,570
Sorry, sorry.

671
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,560
What trouble were you causing last night
when you should've been sleeping?

672
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,760
Me? Causing trouble?

673
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,510
Someone else caused trouble

674
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,640
and took it out on me.

675
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,750
Sir,

676
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,860
please prepare ten doses
of this prescription for me.

677
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,270
Where do you live?

678
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,389
I'll have them delivered right away.

679
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,030
No need.

680
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,139
He'll do the delivery.

681
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,030
Me?

682
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,739
Yes.

683
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,110
Physician,

684
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,320
save my son!

685
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,969
Please save my son!

686
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,000
Physician! Physician!

687
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,719
Don't hold the kid like that.
Put him down!

688
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,469
Please save my son!

689
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,210
If you keep holding him like this,
he'll die!

690
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,960
Put him down!

691
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,420
Trust me. I'm a physician.

692
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,639
Go bring over a cow!

693
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,770
Do you have a cow here?

694
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,290
No.

695
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,719
Does anyone have a cow?

696
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,590
Go bring one!

697
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,320
I need to get a cow.

698
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,980
Wait for me!

699
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,130
Physician!

700
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,590
Please save my son.

701
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,020
He was underwater for too long.

702
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,870
It's too late.

703
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,560
Sir.

704
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,510
It's too late.

705
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,670
His chest is still warm.

706
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,730
Bring me a bench,

707
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,760
a pillow, and a quilt.

708
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,590
What for?

709
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,550
Just go get them!

710
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,120
Fuling,

711
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,040
pound up some soapberries

712
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,030
and bring them to me in cotton cloth.

713
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,560
Alright.

714
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,430
Miss, can you save my son?

715
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,880
I'll do my best.

716
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,500
There's still a slim chance.

717
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,420
Thank you!

718
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,600
Thank you!

719
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,650
-Thank you!
-It's alright.

720
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,480
It's alright.

721
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,950
Sir,

722
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,950
put the soapberry paste at his anus.

723
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,590
Okay.

724
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,920
Put the bench here.

725
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,340
Miss Qin, here's the stone you asked for.

726
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,280
Put it here.

727
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,130
Lay the kid facedown on the pillow,

728
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,730
with his belly resting here.

729
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,160
Bai Feng, shake the bench like I'm doing.

730
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,050
Got it.

731
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,870
My Lady.

732
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,580
Why can't I find a cow?

733
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,070
He's alive! He's alive!

734
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,490
Incredible!

735
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,580
That's a great method.

736
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,320
Are you okay?

737
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,050
It works just like a cow's back!

738
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,750
Thank you, thank you!

739
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,300
Sir,

740
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,660
prescribe something
that nourishes Qi and blood for him.

741
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,410
Okay. Okay.

742
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Break it up!

743
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,800
Miss, you're a genius.

744
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,860
A genius!

745
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,110
Are you…

746
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,990
Junior?

747
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,460
Senior?

748
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,700
Junior,

749
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,370
it really is you!

750
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,240
Shen…

751
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,330
Who's that guy?

752
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,950
Him?

753
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,830
He's Miss Song's senior brother

754
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
from the Medicine King Valley.

755
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,430
He doesn't get out much

756
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,920
and focuses on treating people.

757
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,230
He says weird things sometimes.

758
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,020
Don't mind him, Your Highness.

759
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,990
Senior?

760
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,220
Okay. You may go.

761
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,610
What are you doing?

762
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,590
Don't move.

763
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,390
What's wrong?

764
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,890
Fellow disciples?

765
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,610
They're pretty close for fellow disciples.

766
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,130
You've got four hours.

767
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,100
I want everything
you can find on that guy.

768
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,320
Yes.

769
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,800
You used to wear
men's clothes in the valley,

770
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
so I didn't recognize you right away.

771
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,940
I almost said the wrong thing.

772
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,220
That would've been disastrous.

773
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,460
[Sun Muqing, from Medicine King Valley]

774
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,440
So,

775
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,610
I should call you

776
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,430
Qin Wan now?

777
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,420
Just to be safe,

778
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,610
you'd better
keep calling me Junior.

779
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,230
This is life and death for me.

780
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,560
Please keep it a secret.

781
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,600
I hadn't left the valley in a long time.

782
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,860
I didn't know
so much had happened to you.

783
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,240
Why don't you go back
to the Medicine King Valley?

784
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,420
Your seniors will all protect you.

785
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,880
Why work as a coroner here?

786
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,240
You should become a great physician,

787
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,820
or your talent will be wasted.

788
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,980
To me,

789
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
medical skills and forensic skills

790
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,450
are both ways to help people.

791
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,120
As both a physician and a coroner,

792
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,240
I can still

793
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,730
make something of myself.

794
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,430
I can never out-argue you.

795
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,290
Just don't regret it one day.

796
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,200
So,

797
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,180
you're Miss Qin's senior disciple?

798
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,330
I'm Sun Muqing,

799
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,590
and you are?

800
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,300
I'm the Heir of Prince Rui,

801
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,180
Yan Chi.

802
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,580
So you're the one who made
my junior sister work as a coroner.

803
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,940
-It's my pleasure…
-Nice to meet you.

804
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,660
Junior,

805
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,640
from what I can tell,

806
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,390
this man has a good presence,

807
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,430
decent features,

808
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,830
and a solid temperament.

809
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,830
It may be worth it to help him.

810
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,250
Senior, you make a good point.

811
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,640
Oh, by the way,

812
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,590
I heard there's an amazing healer
in Jingzhou

813
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,920
with incredible medical skills.

814
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,250
Do you know this person?

815
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,330
Mr. Sun, it looks like

816
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,810
you don't know Miss Qin

817
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,150
is that amazing healer.

818
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm off.

819
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,430
Where are you going?

820
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,820
I left the valley this time

821
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,370
to visit all the famous physicians
out there.

822
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,160
Junior,

823
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,510
I watched how you saved

824
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,120
that kid who nearly drowned today.

825
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,880
Not bad. You've made progress.

826
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,970
You do deserve to be called
an amazing healer.

827
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,960
Next time we meet,

828
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,430
let's see whose skills have gotten better.

829
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,960
One more thing.

830
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,090
You should wear
women's clothes more often.

831
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,620
You look great in them.

832
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,870
I gotta go.

833
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
I've never seen you so happy before.

834
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,440
Senior Sun is obsessed with medicine.

835
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,080
We've always gotten along well.

836
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,720
He's free-spirited and unrestrained.

837
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,870
If he came off rude,

838
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,430
please don't take offense.

839
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,040
Free-spirited and unrestrained?

840
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,630
So you like someone like him?

841
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,020
Of course I like him.

842
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,370
Then why didn't you ask him to stay?

843
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,560
I thought you weren't the coy type.

844
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,410
Why would I ask him to stay?

845
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,150
I don't like him in that way.

846
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,720
When I was studying
in the Medicine King Valley,

847
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,670
he was the only one

848
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,760
who never looked down on me
for being a woman

849
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,200
and never envied or excluded me

850
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,400
because of my talent.

851
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,780
I see him as a friend
who challenges me and has my back.

852
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,980
Why would you assume…

853
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,600
Can't men and women
have a genuine friendship?

854
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,530
I was being narrow-minded.

855
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,230
Please forgive me, Miss Qin.

856
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,090
So you came to apologize?

857
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,720
I sincerely apologize.

858
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,400
Then why are you grinning?

859
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,060
You mentioned a genuine friendship,
and I really admire it.

860
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,340
Having a friend you can be

861
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,710
completely honest and open with

862
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,770
is truly enviable.

863
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,670
The higher your status,

864
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,380
the harder it is
to find a friend like that.

865
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,040
No wonder you misunderstood.

866
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,670
Then I hope someday

867
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,340
you can be

868
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,360
just as open and at ease with me.

869
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,190
Then, Your Highness,

870
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,680
please don't barge into my carriage again.

871
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,590
That depends on my mood.

872
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,900
Your Highness.

873
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,270
Everything's been taken care of.

874
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,540
Okay.

875
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,530
Stop.

876
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,360
What's wrong?

877
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,080
The Marquis of Zhongyong's men
have arrived from the capital.

878
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,310
-Second Young Master, these boxes…
-Move them in.

879
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,440
You'd better stay out of sight for now.

880
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,130
You be careful too.

881
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,750
Come, this way.

882
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,510
Careful.

883
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,360
Yes.

884
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,630
I never imagined

885
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,500
I'd see you again, Yan.

886
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,590
[Qin Yan, the eldest son
of the Marquis of Zhongyong]

887
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,920
We're so grateful to your mother

888
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,650
for still caring for us.

889
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,390
At least we have a way forward now.

890
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,700
With everything the third branch
has been through,

891
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,550
your cousin has to depend on your father
to get married.

892
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,620
Don't worry, Aunt.

893
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,510
I'll take good care of my cousins.

894
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,320
Cousins?

895
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,840
Do you mean

896
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,700
Shuang can also go to the capital?

897
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,590
Greetings, Aunt, cousins.

898
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,310
You

899
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,030
must be Wan, right?

900
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,730
We were just kids when we parted.

901
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,530
You've grown into a big girl now.

902
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,680
What are you standing there for?

903
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,210
Greet Cousin Yan properly.

904
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,800
Greetings, Cousin Yan.

905
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,010
I was in a rush for this trip.

906
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,580
This jade is a small gift for you.

907
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,280
Once we're back in the capital,

908
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,280
I'll give you a proper welcome gift.

909
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,240
The capital?

910
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:27,770
Yes.

911
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,670
I came this time

912
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,490
to personally bring my three cousins back.
