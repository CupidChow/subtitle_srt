[Episode 18]

3
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,310
Help!

4
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,820
Miss Qin, it's me.

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Help me!

6
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,140
I was so scared.

7
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,200
I was terrified.

8
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,780
Thank you, Miss Qin. Thank you.

9
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,480
You deserve it.

10
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,670
You deserve it. You deserve it.

11
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,910
-Let go of me!
-You bastard!

12
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,040
-Let go of me!
-How dare you laugh at me?

13
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,360
I'll beat you to death!

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,380
Eldest Young Master,

15
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,640
please don't hurt him.

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,010
He's your own brother!

17
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,550
You called me a bastard!

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,940
I'm going to tell Father!

19
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,660
How dare you throw stones at me?

20
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,990
Today, I'll beat

21
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,910
both of you!

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,620
Stop!

23
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,380
Hurting a woman and a child?

24
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,820
What kind of man does that?

25
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm the eldest young master
of the Pang family.

26
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,220
One of them is a servant,

27
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,570
and the other is just a bastard.

28
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,700
Why can't I hit them?

29
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,590
Bah!

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,210
My Lady, let's ignore him.

31
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,500
For Miss Qin's sake,

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,700
I'll spare you today!

33
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,160
Thank you, Miss Qin.

34
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,540
You know me?

35
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,380
I've seen you from afar.

36
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,310
My name is Qing.

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,370
I serve the madam of the house.

38
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,990
The madam?

39
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,500
She's...

40
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,690
the second wife of the master.

41
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,850
The Eldest Young Master
is the son of his first wife.

42
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,210
I was being presumptuous.

43
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,220
Please don't take it to heart, Miss Qin.

44
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,780
Madam doesn't mind such things.

45
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,500
Qing,

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm going to play in the cave.

47
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,910
It's bedtime.

48
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,240
Just for a little while.

49
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,540
All right.

50
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,990
Don't go too far.

51
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,910
I've been here two days

52
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,910
and haven't formally met the madam yet.

53
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,910
She's not in good health

54
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,540
and rarely sees visitors.

55
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,910
I'm quite skilled in medicine.

56
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,520
If needed, you can come to me.

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,960
Then I'll thank you on her behalf.

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,940
Wait until I've cured her,

59
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,140
then you can thank me.

60
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,380
Do you know who was

61
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,910
performing Mulian Rescues His Mother
just now?

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,310
Probably someone from Shuangqing Troupe.

63
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,470
Are they all detained
at the prefect's office waiting for trial?

64
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,709
That I'm not sure of,

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,470
but if you want to know,

66
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,120
I'll keep an ear out for you.

67
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,030
My Lady,

68
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,330
it's getting late.

69
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,830
Then we'll head back now.

70
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:33,900
Thank you.

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,159
It was nothing.

72
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,950
Young Master.

73
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,510
Let's go.

74
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,659
Madam Qin,

75
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,720
the hot water is ready. I'm coming in.

76
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,960
So Liu Renli and Pang Fuliang
are both from Dingzhou.

77
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,980
For over a decade, not only have they
never returned to Dingzhou,

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,100
they've also been deliberately
concealing their origins.

79
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,780
They won't even acknowledge
their ancestors.

80
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,310
They must have committed
something serious.

81
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,190
Go find out

82
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,180
what major crimes or scandals happened

83
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,070
in Dingzhou around the time they left.

84
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,610
Master,

85
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,150
shall I make a trip to Dingzhou myself?

86
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,630
No need.

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,300
Clowns like them aren't worth your effort.

88
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,700
Leave it to the Dove Unit.

89
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,270
You just

90
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,270
focus on keeping Fuling company.

91
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,600
Take her out more often.

92
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,710
Yes.

93
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,370
Let's go to Qinghui Manor!

94
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,720
The Crown Prince always values talent.

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,540
Whether someone rose through
the imperial exams or bought an official title,

96
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,340
as long as they are able
to get things done,

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,670
he treats them the same.

98
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,300
Commissioner Liu,
there's no need to worry.

99
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,180
I see.

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,310
As for transferring to a capital post,

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,860
now isn't the right time.

102
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,790
You'd be better off
trying to keep your current position.

103
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,180
As long as you keep control of
the salt permits in the Southeast region,

104
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,270
there's no need to worry about
not gaining the Crown Prince's favor.

105
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,540
That would help the Crown Prince

106
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,740
far more than taking some

107
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,870
idle fourth-rank post in the capital,

108
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,030
wouldn't you say?

109
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,740
But...

110
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,030
Young Master Yan,

111
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,930
you're absolutely right.

112
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,910
Everyone else is trying
to climb the ranks.

113
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,560
Who would think we only seek to remain
in our current positions?

114
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,030
Commissioner Liu has built solid ties
in the Ministry of Personnel over the years.

115
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,290
I'm sure handling this

116
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,460
is nothing for him.

117
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,580
Mr. Pang, you flatter me.

118
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,120
I simply enjoy making friends,

119
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,940
nothing that could be called "solid ties."

120
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,659
Young Master Yan,
when will you return to the capital?

121
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,720
When I go there to give my work report,

122
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,340
I must go to your residence
to visit the Marquis of Zhongyong.

123
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,030
For this trip to the capital,

124
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,100
your work report should be
your top priority.

125
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,760
You'll have plenty of chances

126
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,640
to meet my father in the future.

127
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,430
Young Master Qin, you're right.

128
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,830
Master!

129
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,780
What is it?

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,330
Something happened to Madam Qin.

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,180
The maid Juan said

132
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,030
the deceased was Madam Qin,

133
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,220
a friend of Pang Fuliang.

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,030
Madam?

135
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,300
Does she have an official title?

136
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,740
This courtyard changes servants
every year.

137
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,909
Pang Fuliang only instructed the servants

138
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,220
to call her Madam Qin.

139
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
No one knows her name or background.

140
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,270
A madam of unknown identity?

141
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,360
Her background is likely questionable.

142
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,180
There are no signs
of dragging or struggle.

143
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,230
It looks like a suicide by hanging.

144
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,520
Otherwise, the murderer covered
their tracks a little too perfectly.

145
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,530
Top-grade Yunwu Peak Tea.

146
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,650
Not a single sip taken.

147
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,630
I have this tea in my room too.

148
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,810
It's reserved for honored guests
at Qinghui Manor.

149
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,340
Maybe after dinner,

150
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,030
she asked the tea house to send some over.

151
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,059
It would make sense if she wanted one last

152
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,580
cup of good tea before ending her life.

153
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,179
But she didn't take a single sip

154
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,909
before she rushed to her death.

155
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,909
That doesn't make sense.

156
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,510
There are some abrasion marks here,

157
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,710
like a rope being pulled back and forth.

158
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,390
Strange indeed.

159
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,390
Arrange for me to examine
the body as soon as possible.

160
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,290
I'll take you there directly.

161
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,060
This is a crime scene. No entry allowed.

162
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,270
Commissioner Liu,
please restrain yourself.

163
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,540
I need to see how she is.

164
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,870
Move! I'm going in!

165
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,820
Please restrain yourself!

166
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,460
Bai Feng.

167
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,950
Let Commissioner Liu enter.

168
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,150
She...

169
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,940
She...

170
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,940
When we arrived, it was too late,

171
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,740
and she had been dead for a while.

172
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,770
Your Highness,

173
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,950
how could she…

174
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,980
just leave like this?

175
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,230
May I ask what your relationship
with the deceased is?

176
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,820
She...

177
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
was an old acquaintance of mine.

178
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,480
Was she really just an acquaintance?

179
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,420
She was the former leader
of Shuangqing Troupe,

180
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,870
Qing Li's master,

181
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,110
Qing Yun.

182
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,230
The deceased...

183
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,430
Madam Qin was the master
of the late Leader Qing Li?

184
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,280
So, Mr. Pang and Commissioner Liu,

185
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,280
you both knew the deceased?

186
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,580
Commissioner Liu and I loved watching

187
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
Shuangqing Troupe's performances
when we were young.

188
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,110
At that time, Madam Qin happened
to be the troupe leader.

189
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,710
We got acquainted over time.

190
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,910
I suppose

191
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,230
we became friends through art.

192
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,110
I see.

193
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,870
Qing Yun,

194
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,170
why did you take this path?

195
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,140
Actually,

196
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
it's still too early to say Madam Qin

197
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,820
died by suicide.

198
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,350
You mean

199
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,370
Qing Yun was murdered?

200
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,990
Governor Wang will arrange to send
the body to the prefect's office.

201
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,050
Only after the autopsy can we be sure.

202
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,980
Since you have informed Governor Wang,

203
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,110
I

204
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,860
will entrust Madam Qin to you.

205
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,700
Bai Feng.

206
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,700
Check whether Shuangqing Troupe
originated in Dingzhou.

207
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,180
Yes.

208
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,000
What's the matter?

209
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,870
Is there something wrong with Dingzhou?

210
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,870
It's these three who have problems.

211
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,570
Liu Renli holds real power

212
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,270
and is a major ally of Pang Fuliang's
collusion with officials.

213
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,150
Pang Fuliang provides Liu Renli with money

214
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,420
for bribery and buying official titles.

215
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,480
And they come from the same hometown.

216
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm not surprised Liu Renli
is a distinguished guest

217
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
at Qinghui Manor.

218
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,050
But Qing Yun

219
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,820
was just an actress
who rose from lowly status.

220
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Given Pang Fuliang's profit-driven nature,

221
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,990
how could he let her stay long
at Qinghui Manor?

222
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,250
And the servants here change every year,

223
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,550
likely to conceal Qing Yun's identity.

224
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,700
Just now, Liu Renli's expression

225
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,310
suggested he has some affection
for Qing Yun.

226
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,180
But Pang Fuliang

227
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,350
seemed eager to distance himself from her.

228
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,150
Could it be that

229
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,100
Qing Yun held leverage over them,

230
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,700
which left Pang Fuliang no choice
but to tolerate her presence?

231
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,030
There must be something

232
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,850
among the three of them
that can't stand the light of day.

233
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,180
Was it you who killed Qing Yun?

234
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,590
Answer me!

235
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,010
It wasn't me.

236
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,510
She had just mentioned Shifang Inn to you,

237
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,270
and now she's dead. How do you explain it?

238
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,660
As long as I didn't agree,

239
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,630
she couldn't do anything.

240
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,750
Why would I dirty my own hands?

241
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,190
Think about it.

242
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,660
Qing Li is dead,

243
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,180
and now Qing Yun too.

244
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,990
Only we few know about this matter.

245
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,230
How can I trust you?

246
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,770
What if word got out about

247
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,420
what happened back then?

248
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,270
Yan Chi already has his eye on you.

249
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,420
If the truth about
that incident resurfaces,

250
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,870
neither of us

251
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,530
will make it out alive.

252
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,980
This...

253
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,500
This...

254
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,870
This is Atractylodes water.

255
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,940
It removes the stench of decay

256
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,540
and prevents corpse poison.

257
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,910
Governor Wang, you've never been
inside a morgue, have you?

258
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,750
Then let this be your first lesson

259
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,230
in the saying

260
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,420
"The beginning of the investigation
lies in the autopsy."

261
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,880
I appreciate your guidance, Your Highness.

262
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,150
The deceased was approximately
45 to 55 years old.

263
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Her makeup was intact
at the time of death,

264
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,390
clothing undamaged,

265
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,720
no obvious signs of dragging.

266
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,620
There's an oil stain on her left sleeve,

267
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,750
scented with ambergris—

268
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,870
likely an expensive fragrance oil.

269
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,700
There's an abrasion on her upper back,

270
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,960
about 0.4 inches long,

271
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,460
with jagged edges.

272
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,070
Green sawdust was found in the fibers,

273
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,220
possibly from rubbing against
a pillar or pavilion.

274
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,820
Bai Feng,

275
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,540
investigate this yourself.

276
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,030
Yes.

277
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,030
The deceased's neck vessels
were constricted,

278
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,490
causing a pale complexion

279
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,120
and tiny hemorrhages on the eyelids.

280
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,940
The ligature mark
is above the Adam's apple,

281
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,880
bluish-purple

282
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,300
with dark red congestion
on the upper edge.

283
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,660
The mark is deep in the front of the neck,

284
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,860
shallow on the sides,

285
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,630
and does not extend to the back.

286
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,180
The ligature mark is wide and neat,

287
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,710
matching the fold
of the deceased's armband.

288
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,970
The tongue tip pressed against
the teeth but did not protrude,

289
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,300
with slight injury and bleeding
on the hyoid bone.

290
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,630
There's the smell of alcohol in her mouth.

291
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,600
She likely drank before death.

292
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,990
Purple-red livor mortis appeared

293
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,140
on her ankles and the tops of her feet,

294
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,270
in blotches and lines.

295
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
The cause of death

296
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,180
is likely strangulation.

297
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
So it was indeed suicide by hanging.

298
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,490
Strangulation

299
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,660
doesn't always mean suicide by hanging.

300
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,460
When someone hangs themselves,
they inevitably struggle,

301
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,720
which leaves irregular ligature marks.

302
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,780
The deceased was nearly 50

303
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,440
but took great care with her makeup

304
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
and clothing,

305
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,070
showing she cherished her appearance.

306
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,150
Such a person likely

307
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,390
wouldn't use her own clothes
to hang herself,

308
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,250
which would ruin her appearance.

309
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,690
The ligature rope she used
was Huzhou Blue Silk,

310
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,510
a fabric prone to wrinkling.

311
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,150
When suffocating,

312
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,390
people instinctively grab
at the ligature rope.

313
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,700
But there are

314
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,160
no grip marks on this rope.

315
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,420
The deceased must have lost consciousness

316
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,740
before the ligature rope was placed.

317
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,349
So, whether it was suicide by hanging

318
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,880
still requires an autopsy.

319
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,260
An autopsy?

320
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,349
But the coroners at the prefect's office
are all out on cases.

321
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,410
Master Wan is here.

322
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,760
You don't need to worry about that.

323
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,580
[Morgue]

324
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,360
Do you have a headache?

325
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,040
I'm used to it.

326
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,260
My head hurts so much.

327
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,700
Why is a hangover so awful?

328
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,100
I'll never drink again.

329
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,530
Then don't beg me next time.

330
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,690
Governor Wang?

331
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,150
Are you hungover too?

332
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,420
This isn't a hangover.

333
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,220
He's obviously been frightened
by Little Wan'er.

334
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,070
I've seen it before.

335
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,880
It's just sewing up a belly
with a big needle.

336
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,720
Look at you acting tough.

337
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,960
That's nothing.

338
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,480
I've even seen Little Wan'er

339
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,440
cut open a dead person's belly.

340
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,700
Did you throw up?

341
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,520
I'll give it a try.

342
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,870
If I hold out,

343
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,270
you owe me the next drink.

344
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Deal.

345
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,740
I won again.

346
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,510
Make him some sugar water.

347
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,790
Right away.

348
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,790
This is because of
the wine from yesterday.

349
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,590
Just drink it.

350
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,610
Datura?

351
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,700
The common knockout powders
and anesthetics

352
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,310
on the market are white powders.

353
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,550
This black powder

354
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,520
is actually ground Datura seeds,

355
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,940
which are more toxic.

356
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,660
Within 15 minutes of ingestion,

357
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,390
it causes dizziness, sleepiness,

358
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,450
and limb numbness.

359
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,370
After half an hour, it leads to coma.

360
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,070
Mixed with alcohol,
the toxicity is stronger.

361
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,410
But I didn't see any drinking vessels
during the examination.

362
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,570
Either the victim drank outside,

363
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,160
or the murderer, fearing exposure,

364
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,700
disposed of the wine bottle

365
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,790
containing the Datura seed powder.

366
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,990
But if there were

367
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,150
Datura seed powder in the bottle,

368
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,750
the wine would taste bitter.

369
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,000
How could the victim have drunk it?

370
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,660
If the murderer drank with the victim,

371
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,310
and when she was already quite drunk,

372
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,790
swapped her wine with the poisoned one,

373
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,330
she wouldn't notice at the moment.

374
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:27,920
Master.

375
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,110
Miss Qin.

376
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,550
Miss Qin, please look at this.

377
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,210
Is this fabric the same
as the victim's clothes?

378
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,260
Where did you find it?

379
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,590
On the pillar of the pavilion
outside Pang Fuliang's study.

380
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,150
Pang Fuliang?

381
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,090
It's exactly the same.

382
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,480
[Qinghui Manor]

383
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,170
This contains some ambergris
from Weizhou Island,

384
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,390
with a subtle, lingering fragrance

385
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,980
that lasts for a very long time.

386
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,660
Your Highness, if you like it,

387
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,120
I'll have someone
deliver it to you shortly.

388
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,920
Okay.

389
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,310
Just send it to Miss Qin.

390
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,380
Miss Qin is refined and intelligent;

391
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,590
this scent suits her perfectly.

392
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,150
Mr. Pang, did you specially

393
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,310
invite Madam Qin to stay this time?

394
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,500
Madam Qin usually traveled
with Shuangqing Troupe.

395
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,910
I've never invited her alone.

396
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,220
You seem quite displeased with Madam Qin.

397
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,070
I...

398
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
didn't want to speak ill of the dead,

399
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,680
but at this point,

400
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,450
I have to.

401
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,630
After Madam Qin stepped down
as the troupe leader,

402
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,130
I took pity on her

403
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,940
and offered her some help
from time to time,

404
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,000
but unexpectedly,

405
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,070
it only made her more greedy.

406
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,590
Yesterday she actually demanded
30% shares of my Shifang Inn

407
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,790
in exchange for Shuangqing Troupe.

408
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,910
I was so angry that I drove her away.

409
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,470
So you discussed this matter

410
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,550
with Madam Qin here?

411
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,720
This is where I meet important guests.

412
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,750
I met her in the outer courtyard pavilion.

413
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,680
Did she stay for dinner?

414
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,150
She liked drinking;

415
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,590
we only had some wine and dishes.

416
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,040
Okay.

417
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,720
Sorry to bother you.

418
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,020
I'll take my leave.

419
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,170
Let me see you out.

420
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,730
No need.

421
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,700
Servants.

422
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,820
Master,

423
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,080
any instructions?

424
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,630
Go fetch the Madam.

425
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,640
Master,

426
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,470
Madam has been feeling unwell lately.

427
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,420
I'm telling you to go get her.

428
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,350
Yes, yes.

429
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,410
I'll go right away.

430
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,420
The oil stain on the deceased's sleeve

431
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,390
matches the lamp oil
from Pang Fuliang's study.

432
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,020
They not only met there

433
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,080
but also shared food and wine.

434
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,430
Please.

435
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,650
But Pang Fuliang lied,

436
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,460
claiming they met
in the outer courtyard pavilion.

437
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,500
I deliberately had him
send you the lamp oil.

438
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,900
Now we have the evidence.

439
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,930
Datura seeds have a strong taste,

440
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,830
but if mixed into heavily seasoned dishes,

441
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,020
it's hard to notice.

442
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,870
Pang Fuliang has
powerful connections here.

443
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,110
If he wants to kill someone,

444
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,310
he'd have plenty of ways
to cover his tracks.

445
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,310
For now, we need to find
his motive for killing Qing Yun.

446
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,310
But I'm afraid it's not that simple.

447
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,180
With Prince Yu's influence
among the royals,

448
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,870
Pang Fuliang wouldn't dare make a move

449
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,420
during his birthday banquet.

450
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,590
Besides,
His Majesty's intention to investigate

451
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,150
the salt transport corruption
has already spread.

452
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,940
Liu Renli is relying on the Crown Prince
to get out of trouble.

453
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,150
If Pang Fuliang wants to protect him,

454
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,850
he'd be even less likely to act rashly.

455
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,500
Qing Li and Qing Yun
died in succession in Yuzhou.

456
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,160
This cannot be a coincidence.

457
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,740
None of the witness statements
or physical evidence

458
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,910
match up in these two cases.

459
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,770
Everything about this feels off.

460
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,850
This is the first time
I've seen you stumped.

461
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,350
I'm not afraid of that.

462
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,410
I just hate the feeling of being lost.

463
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,390
Don't worry.

464
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,110
Let's be patient

465
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,350
and look into Qing Yun's past first.

466
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,950
Maybe we'll find something.

467
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,390
You're tired today.

468
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,220
Get some rest.

469
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,870
If Bai Feng finds anything,

470
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,270
let me know immediately.

471
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,600
Don't worry.

472
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,110
I won't miss any chance to see you.

473
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,140
I'll go now.

474
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,830
Or Fuling will try to stop me again
if she sees me.

475
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,530
Miss Qin.

476
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,260
Young Master Pang, why are you here?

477
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,980
My father

478
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,770
sent me to deliver some lamp oil to you.

479
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,440
Thank you.

480
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,790
Who dared to kick me?

481
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,390
How dare you get handsy
with Little Wan'er?

482
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,350
Do you want to die?

483
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:50,910
Stop hitting him.

484
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,240
Why are you drunk again?

485
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,000
Yue Ning!

486
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,910
Yue Ning!

487
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,590
Look.

488
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,130
Wan,

489
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,700
let me tell you,

490
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
we are

491
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,560
a couple, not brothers.

492
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
No, that's wrong.

493
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,940
We're brothers,

494
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,700
not a couple.

495
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,350
If you are my brother,

496
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,630
don't stop me!

497
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,390
I'm gonna beat you up!

498
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,980
Stop it!

499
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,220
You'd better run now.

500
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,670
When the Princess gets angry,
I can't hold her back.

501
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,530
Miss Qin, I'm leaving right away.

502
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,060
If you have time tomorrow,

503
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,940
would you like to go boating with me?

504
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Boating?

505
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,590
Who do you think you are,

506
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,110
dreaming of take my sister-in-law boating?

507
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,870
I...

508
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,980
He's a...

509
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,550
toad.

510
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,590
Why didn't you say so earlier?

511
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,260
A toad.

512
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,810
I won't stoop to arguing with drunkards!

513
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,390
Loser.

514
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,870
-Bah!
-Bah!

515
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,150
Here.

516
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,530
Let me do it.

517
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,150
Fuling,

518
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,700
give the Princess some hangover soup

519
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,830
when she wakes up.

520
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,140
My Lady,

521
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,220
Lord Yan Li takes the Princess out

522
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,460
drinking and fooling around.

523
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,590
If this keeps up, she'll be led astray.

524
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,220
I'm afraid before she's led astray,

525
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,630
she'll drink herself sick first.

526
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,600
When she wakes up, I'll talk to her.

527
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,700
Cheers.

528
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,260
I can drink more.

529
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,390
Stop drinking. Haven't you had enough?

530
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,760
Wipe your hands.

531
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

532
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,310
My Lady, you smile more often than before.

533
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,160
Well...

534
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,070
really?

535
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,630
I didn't notice.

536
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,790
Since His Highness

537
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,150
has made you so happy,

538
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,550
I'll forgive him for

539
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,680
dragging you around to work every day.

540
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,310
But I actually like it

541
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,300
when he drags me along to work.

542
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,430
What should I do?

543
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,160
My Lady,

544
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,150
when others like someone deeply,

545
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,900
they keep it to themselves,

546
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
unlike you,

547
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,310
who always wear your heart on your sleeve.

548
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,070
You

549
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,400
are becoming more and more like my mother.

550
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,340
My Lady, are you saying I nag too much?

551
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,830
Take good care of the Princess.

552
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,360
I'm going to write my notes.

553
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,810
Neither of these two ever gives me peace.

554
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,980
It hurts so much!

555
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,630
It really hurts!

556
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,390
It hurts like hell!

557
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,750
I didn't go that hard on him.

558
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,410
It hurts so bad!

559
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,870
Chi,

560
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,350
I swear I didn't tell them
to go that hard on him.

561
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,700
I just couldn't stand the way
he kept eyeing Wan,

562
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,660
so I…

563
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,700
Who's the young lady looking for me?

564
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,070
Where is she?

565
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,590
Are you the girl who likes me?

566
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,280
Young Master Pang,

567
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,830
I've been waiting for you.

568
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,790
What a lovely beauty.

569
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,530
I like what I see.

570
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,080
Let me give you a hug!

571
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,390
I'll teach you a lesson!

572
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,490
Not only do I have a lovely figure,

573
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm also quite strong!

574
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,350
-Trying to seduce me, huh?
-Who's hitting me?

575
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,260
Keep doing it and you'll see!

576
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,870
My father won't let you off for this!

577
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,670
Keep doing it!

578
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,110
I really didn't expect

579
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,790
that little creep
would get Wan to treat his injuries.

580
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,700
If I'd known earlier that
she could perform autopsies

581
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,630
and had such great medical skills,

582
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,030
I'd never have done this.

583
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,150
Wan,

584
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,520
will this work?

585
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,810
Cousin Yan,

586
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,740
since you specifically asked me
to treat Young Master Pang,

587
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,140
I must take it seriously.

588
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,220
After this acupuncture,

589
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,960
he'll be able to walk right away.

590
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,890
If I don't do it,
he'll be stuck in bed for half a month.

591
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,390
It hurts!

592
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,590
I'll take the half-month in bed.

593
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,470
Ning, help me hold his leg down.

594
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,220
Okay.

595
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,480
What are you doing?

596
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,830
Young Master Pang,

597
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,910
if your meridians were clear,

598
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,040
this wouldn't hurt.

599
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,500
To avoid future problems,

600
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,100
you'd better just endure it.

601
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,940
My sister-in-law is ruthless
when treating patients.

602
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,770
I suddenly have something to do.
Gotta go now.

603
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,370
Come back.

604
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Handle this well,

605
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,070
and it'll count as
making up for your mistakes.

606
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,070
Don't worry, Chi.

607
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,160
Let me tell you guys.

608
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,220
I can't take it anymore.

609
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,790
I'm literally dying of laughter.

610
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,110
You didn't see it just now,

611
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,870
but Little Wan'er was incredible.

612
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,940
She stuck such a thick needle

613
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,550
right into his toenail base.

614
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,530
I wonder which hero did it.

615
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,150
Truly satisfying.

616
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,420
Keep your voice down.

617
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,720
Don't let Wan hear you.

618
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,980
It wasn't you, was it?

619
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,260
You really can't
judge a book by its cover.

620
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,190
The dream lover of many young girls
has become a hero.

621
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:18,740
I...

622
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,390
Come with me to
handle something important.

623
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:22,920
Let's go.

624
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,980
What is it?

625
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,280
[Yunshao Theater]

626
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,420
Didn't Chi tell us to investigate
Shuangqing Troupe?

627
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,080
Why are we at Yunshao Theater?

628
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,980
Silly.

629
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,390
If you want to find out about someone,

630
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,920
don't ask their associates

631
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,870
but their sworn enemy.

632
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,870
The person who hates you most
knows you best.

633
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,460
Yunshao Theater used to be
Yuzhou's biggest opera house.

634
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,660
Ever since Shifang Inn teamed up
with Shuangqing Troupe,

635
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,100
it almost went bankrupt.

636
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,460
Everyone here hates Pang Fuliang

637
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,790
and Shuangqing Troupe.

638
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,310
If you want to find out about them,

639
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,170
is there a better place than this?

640
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,420
I didn't expect

641
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,180
your scheming mind to actually
come in handy.

642
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,710
Let's go.

643
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,700
Come with me to be a spy.

644
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,870
Alright!

645
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,110
Sir, ma'am,

646
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,170
please come inside to watch the show.

647
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,870
Minister Li,

648
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,350
the files and accounts of salt transport

649
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,310
in the southeast region are all here.

650
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,660
I'm returning to the capital today.

651
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,880
Have everything loaded onto
the carriages immediately.

652
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,440
Yes.

653
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,150
In this vast world,

654
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,420
there's no place for me.

655
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,610
Why are you here again?

656
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,110
I'm here to give you this.

657
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,720
This is my father's notebook.

658
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,180
Where did you get it?

659
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,530
I heard Lord Shen served as

660
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,500
an official in Yuzhou for three years,

661
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,620
so I thought there might be some

662
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,500
of his handwritten notes
among the case files.

663
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,230
Sure enough, the clerk found this notebook

664
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,420
in the archive.

665
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,190
These are all written
by my father himself,

666
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
full of his case-solving insights.

667
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,290
Thank you.

Qing?

677
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,910
Greetings, Miss Qin.

678
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,100
Do you know who's singing?

679
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,920
I don't know.

680
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,390
Then who are you looking for?

681
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,400
The Madam.

682
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,940
She has a daughter?

683
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,870
An adopted daughter.

684
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,650
She was an orphan
she found alone in the wild

685
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
and took pity on, so she adopted her.

686
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,940
Madam!

687
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,160
Thank goodness.

688
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,770
You scared me.

689
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,310
Qing,

690
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,620
you found me.

691
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,650
Qing, that man can dive.

692
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,950
I want to dive too.

693
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,400
[Qinghui Manor]

694
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,430
This is Commissioner Liu's
official uniform?

695
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,830
Indeed it is.

696
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,710
Did he ever tell you

697
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,620
he intended to resign?

698
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,670
Your Highness,

699
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,100
His Majesty is launching an investigation

700
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,870
into the embezzlement
of southeast salt transport taxes.

701
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,620
Why are you

702
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,790
asking further?

703
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,190
So you think

704
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,850
Commissioner Liu committed suicide

705
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,020
out of guilt?

706
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,880
If he wasn't desperate,

707
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,620
why would he give up

708
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,710
this official seal?

709
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,680
Is there anything unusual about the body?

710
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,750
There's white powder

711
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,140
around his mouth and nose,

712
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,540
as well as in his trachea,

713
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,140
which also contains some silt.

714
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,990
Both lungs are swollen,

715
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,800
moist, and have spots.

716
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,420
The stomach contains fluid

717
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,620
but no leftover food.

718
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,520
There are no signs of poisoning
or knockout drugs.

719
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,140
It's confirmed to be drowning.

720
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,630
The deceased's wrists and neck

721
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,190
have fresh strangulation marks.

722
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:44,940
The heels

723
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,830
and calves

724
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,090
have minor abrasions,

725
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,910
likely caused by struggling

726
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,870
on rough ground while alive.

727
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,910
But when we found him,

728
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,540
his hands and feet weren't bound.

729
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,390
We searched along the river

730
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,540
and found no ropes

731
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,000
capable of tying an adult.

732
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,360
Unless...

733
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,160
he was strangled unconscious
and then pushed into the lake.

734
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,800
That's the strange part.

735
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,020
Look.

736
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,810
There's an oval scar
on the side of the deceased's body.

737
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,030
This is a spear wound.

738
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,350
It was likely caused by a spear

739
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,480
or similar weapon.

740
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,600
His right palm

741
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,020
and the web between his thumb
and index finger

742
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,790
are covered with thick calluses.

743
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,620
Though he was
a civil official for 10 years,

744
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,990
these calluses show

745
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,870
he never stopped practicing martial arts.

746
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,820
His physical strength must be impressive.

747
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,870
It would be difficult
for an ordinary person

748
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,230
to strangle him barehanded.

749
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,710
And when we arrived,

750
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,060
he had just died.

751
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,230
The killer probably didn't have time
to take the rope away

752
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,430
to cover up the scene.

753
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,470
But if there was no rope,

754
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,780
where did these strangulation marks
come from?

755
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,090
It must have been rope.

756
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,270
The key is the rope's material.

757
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,420
Let me.

758
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:08,910
Look.

759
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,020
The strangulation marks on the body

760
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,540
are lighter than those from normal rope,

761
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,070
and there are no abrasions,

762
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,800
indicating the rope was soft.

763
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,460
The killer likely didn't
apply constant force.

764
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,580
Looks like he untied the rope

765
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,180
after the victim passed out.

766
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,050
Could it be that

767
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,420
the killer strangled Liu Renli

768
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,390
just to drown him?

769
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,810
Take a look at this.

770
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,580
These are the silver bills
Liu Renli embezzled,

771
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,980
recovered from the lake.

772
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,620
Including those that were soaked,

773
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,880
the total amounts to over 100,000 taels.

774
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,390
Soaked?

775
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,820
Have you heard of underwater escape magic?

776
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,710
I grew up in the military camp.

777
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,640
How would I know about such things?

778
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,860
It's an old trick from theater troupes.

779
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,640
They make ropes from hemp paper

780
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,820
to tie a person's hands and feet.

781
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,940
When soaked in water,

782
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,230
the ropes dissolve,

783
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,630
allowing the person to escape underwater.

784
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,690
Do ordinary people know this trick?

785
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,940
Of course not.

786
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,980
Otherwise, how would
theater troupes make a living?

787
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,320
I learned this from my father's notebook.

788
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Theater troupes?

789
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,230
Looks like we still need
to investigate Shuangqing Troupe.

790
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,020
Judging by the killer's ruthlessness

791
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,590
in throwing over 10,000 taels
of silver bills into the water,

792
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,120
he must have a deadly grudge

793
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,390
against Liu Renli.
