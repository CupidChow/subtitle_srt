Sun Mu Xing really came for the little fairy

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He went to the capital and asked the little fairy everywhere

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Never mentioned the nine-sister

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But the news of the medicine valley is really not enough

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Master, give me some more time

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let him go, this matter does not need to be checked

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The son of the Marquis Zhongyong Qin Yan has arrived in Qingzhou

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So fast

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Correct

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
A letter from the capital

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The person chosen by the crown princess has already set the daughter of the Marquis Zhongyong, Qin Zhao Yu

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Qin Yan is here to pick up the three ladies to go back to the capital for the New Year

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just three ladies

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If it is for the New Year reunion

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How can you only pick up the three ladies who have not said their wives

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But left Lin and Qin Li alone in Qingzhou

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Marquis Zhongyong will not want to pick a prince and a prince in the three ladies, right?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The prince has just been promoted

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Marquis Zhongyong is in a hurry to use the daughter of the Qin family to attract people's hearts

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If they want to go back to the capital for the New Year, they have to leave the city as soon as possible

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The more north you go, the colder it gets

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you meet the snow, it will be harder to go

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Your Highness, I want to see you

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Your Highness is really wise

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No wonder you let go of the account book of Qingyuan Pawn Shop

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He really hid a book of accounts

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
After getting the account book, he chased after it overnight

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He found that there were two households in Jinzhou who colluded with them

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I immediately ordered the chief of the department to take the people

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you really think my house is a pawnshop?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The account book and the two households are all handed over to Bai Feng

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The House of Huo has made a great contribution this time

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will report to His Majesty as truthfully as possible

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It was the crown prince who made the contribution

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am just running

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's all thanks to his high position

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and the help of the ninth lady

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
House of Huo, how long does it take to organize the files?

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
About half a month

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's just that the draft of the case has also been sent

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Seven days must be done

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If the House of Huo can finish it in seven days

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
These two cases are all your contribution

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no, no, no, no

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It must be completed in seven days

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll leave

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Master, there are still several months left to the end of the year

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why must it be completed in seven days?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's a great credit to him

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do you say?

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Master wants to go back to the capital with the ninth lady

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Keep an eye on the Marquis of Zhongyong

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The matter is not detailed

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Report

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Marquis of Zhongyong is in the capital

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The Marquis of Zhongyong is in the capital

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Report

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're leaving in four days?

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's wrong with the Marquis of Zhongyong?

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why are you getting more and more confused?

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You say, how many people can last a long time with a family that is spoiled by marriage?

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In order to have a child

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It makes everyone feel uncomfortable during the New Year

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mother, don't say that

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Waner is a clear person

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And everyone is their own person

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What can't be said?

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Princess Royal

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You know

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
With my temperament

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can live freely anywhere

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I came today to say goodbye to you

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't worry

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't worry about me

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The capital is far away

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And the people are complicated

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There is no one who really loves you

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How can I not worry?

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When you get better

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can go to the capital to see me

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Fulin

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is the prescription I wrote for you

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You just take the medicine on time every day

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Make sure you are in a good mood

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Walk around

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your body will definitely get better

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are so considerate

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mother, don't worry

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will go and prepare some things

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
When you get to the capital

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You don't have to look at others

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
With your ability and heart

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And the current situation in Qin's mansion

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
When you get back to the capital

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your future will definitely be better

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Which one of the men that Marquis Zhong Yong likes is more attractive?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which one of the men that I like has a better future?

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Jiu, remember

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If your uncle makes a mess for you

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You must fight

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't care if you are filial or not

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you really encounter difficulties

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Remember to ask someone to send a letter

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
At least in front of the emperor and the empress dowager

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I still have a little face

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you, Princess

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why does Xiao Waner have to go?

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I only have one friend like her

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What if she leaves?

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ming, be careful

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That is the head of the Qin family

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Her uncle

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We are innocent and can't speak

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Grandmother, father, mother

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I have something to say

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to marry

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If the mother wants to protect Jiu

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not simple, I have a way

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What way?

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Grandmother and uncle and aunt

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's like Jiu Niangzi's own child

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why don't you let your uncle and aunt recognize Jiu Niangzi as their adopted daughter?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This way, not only does the aunt have a granddaughter

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Marquis Zhong Yong can't interfere in Jiu Niangzi's marriage

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not easy

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then Xiao Waner will be my sister

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I say, Marquis

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Madam, what do you think?

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The seven wolves have already mentioned this to me

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I am naturally happy

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
How about the lady?

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And Xie agreed

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Good

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Princess Dazhang, listen to me all today

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going to marry you

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to marry you

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to marry you

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Listen to me all today

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We don't have to be bold

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Just invite the House of Huo to be our witness

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Tomorrow, the marquis and the lady will have one more daughter

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
From now on

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have one more granddaughter

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ning and Qing have one more sister

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
From now on, the Huo family will be one of our marquis

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you, Princess Dazhang

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Xiao Waner, that's great

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are my sister from now on

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Come here

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Be careful

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Come here

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Xiao Waner

164
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Because she has no

165
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:56,800
The

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,400
Should be called Sister Si

167
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Yes, Sister Si

168
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,960
Thank you sister

169
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,360
You kid

170
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Brothers gave you all the cultural relics such as Yantai and medical books

171
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
You are a sister

172
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,920
But you give me such a gift

173
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,320
So what?

174
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
My sister Si is a person who wants to do great things

175
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
You should have such a defensive weapon

176
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
You are thoughtful

177
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,840
After all, Waner is a fairy

178
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,840
You need to learn to protect yourself

179
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Ninger, please, mother

180
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Let me go back with Sister Si

181
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Don't mess around, get up

182
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I didn't mess around

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Grandma, I ask for this

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Because Sister Si doesn't have a bodyguard

185
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
If I meet a common thief

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
With my skills

187
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I can completely protect Sister Si

188
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Second

189
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I haven't been back to Beijing for ten years

190
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I want to go back and see before I get married

191
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
You are a girl

192
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
What do you mean by getting married?

193
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Mother

194
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
You have already secretly looked at me

195
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
What can't be said

196
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Anyway

197
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
If you don't agree

198
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I won't get married

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Waner goes back to Beijing

200
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Mother will arrange her own bodyguard to protect her

201
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
If you want

202
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
You can go back to Beijing after you get married

203
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Mother, stop coaxing me

204
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Grandmother was also a woman who was good at horse riding

205
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Why didn't she go back to Beijing after she married her grandfather?

206
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Is it because grandmother is not willing to?

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Did I spoil you?

208
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
You can change the elders' life

209
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Let her go

210
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Mother, this child

211
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
I understand Ning'er's mind

212
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Let her go with Waner

213
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
After all

214
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
After getting married

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
There will be no free days

216
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Thank you grandmother

217
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
grandmother

218
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Grandmother is the best

219
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Waner

220
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
We can go to Beijing

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Great

222
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Thank you grandmother

223
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Great, Waner

224
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Come

225
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Princess Royal

226
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
This is too expensive

227
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I can't accept

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Call grandmother

229
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Grandmother

230
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,920
These are for the bodyguard

231
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Remember

232
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
For the Qin family

233
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Don't mention a word

234
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Be careful outside

235
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Understand?

236
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Thank you grandmother

237
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
How did you come in?

238
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Learned from your second brother

239
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Close the eyes and ears

240
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Your Highness

241
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I am in the house of the prince

242
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
There is a law

243
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Who is the cause of the accident?

244
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Today I found out

245
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Qingyuan pawn shop

246
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
With Jinzhou's main force

247
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
There is a connection between the two branches

248
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I just drove from the base

249
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Did you catch anyone?

250
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
No

251
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
No

252
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I didn't

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,160
No.

254
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,920
He heard some noise and ran away.

255
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,640
But Bai Feng went to investigate.

256
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Why did you come back?

257
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,080
I wanted to leave with you.

258
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,320
But now it seems that I have to wait for a few more days.

259
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,760
So I don't know if you're going with Qin Yan

260
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,400
or wait for me.

261
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,520
I'm the daughter of Qin family.

262
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,440
I should go with Qin Yan.

263
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
In case I make a mistake

264
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
and it's hard to explain to Zhou Yonghou.

265
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
You're right.

266
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,160
Since Qin Yan came here,

267
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,480
I can't keep you in the name of the palace.

268
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,080
This is the token of King of Rui's mansion.

269
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
Keep it for your safety.

270
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,920
I can't keep this kind of precious token.

271
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,920
Qin Yan has a personal guard.

272
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,920
Princess also followed me back to the capital.

273
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,880
Nothing will happen.

274
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,360
If you meet the bandits,

275
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,560
they can handle it.

276
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,880
But if it's the official bandits,

277
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,040
they won't have my token.

278
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,440
There are refugees in the north and the east.

279
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,120
And there are some guards who guard the city.

280
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,920
You can keep this token

281
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
as a talisman.

282
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,480
Then you...

283
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,640
How long will you stay in Jinzhou?

284
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,360
When I catch the traitor in the army,

285
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,560
I'll come after you.

286
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,200
Don't worry.

287
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,760
You're wise and wise.

288
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,560
I have nothing to worry about.

289
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
I...

290
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,160
I'll borrow your blanket.

291
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,680
You can't rest here.

292
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,840
I have to go back to the capital before dawn.

293
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
I have no strength to go back to the mansion.

294
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
The

295
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
capital is painted in my mind

296
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,560
and is about to mystery side.

297
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,200
If I don't have enough strength to go back to the capital,

298
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,560
I can't go back.

299
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,360
That's it.

300
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,440
Ning Er.

301
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,200
Look at you!

302
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,240
So reckless!

303
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,840
And you dress like this!

304
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,360
How do you find yourself in such a perfect dress?

305
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
You must be careful

306
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Mother, brother

307
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Don't worry about me

308
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
I will take care of myself

309
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm leaving

310
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Take care

311
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Take care

312
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
You must protect yourself

313
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Xiang, you must listen to your third brother

314
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Don't be willful

315
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Shuang, remember

316
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
After you enter the mansion

317
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
You must keep your duty

318
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Don't be as reckless as before

319
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
and make trouble

320
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Okay

321
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Your uncle

322
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
is the most important rule

323
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
After you enter the mansion

324
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
You must be careful

325
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Don't let anyone pick your faults

326
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Don't worry

327
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I'm going to the capital

328
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
I'm the real wife of the Marquis

329
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
No one dares to pick my faults

330
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Xiang

331
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Xiang

332
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
You must not be so reckless

333
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Your eighth sister

334
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
is your uncle's favorite

335
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
After you enter the mansion

336
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
You must keep your own temper

337
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
and keep your head down

338
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
As long as you keep your uncle's good

339
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
your uncle's mother

340
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
will be fine

341
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
I know

342
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Aunt

343
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
We have almost packed up

344
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
We can go now

345
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Thank you, Yan

346
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Don't worry

347
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I will take care of your safety

348
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Okay

349
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
I will go with you

350
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I will see you off

351
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Brother

352
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I'm leaving

353
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Ninth sister

354
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
Ninth sister

355
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
I'm sorry

356
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
I've been saving so much

357
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Don't mind it

358
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Brother, what do you mean?

359
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
My mother is protecting Qin Xiang

360
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Even if Qin Shuang is not as good

361
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
she won't be too stingy

362
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Only you

363
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
are not reliable in the capital

364
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I will keep the money for you

365
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Here

366
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
That's enough

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
It's all the money you gave me

368
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Ninth sister

369
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Brother, now the third room is up to you

370
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Whether you are the son or the son

371
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
In my heart

372
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
You are always my second brother

373
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Ninth sister

374
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I will not lose face for you

375
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm leaving

376
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Father

377
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Mother

378
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
I can finally go to the capital

379
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
No matter how high or heavy

380
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
the people who hurt you

381
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
are

382
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
I will never forget

383
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
that I was a child

384
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
I will always be a child

385
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
I will always be a child

386
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
I will always be a child

387
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
I will always be a child

388
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
I will always be a child

389
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
I will always be a child

390
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
No matter how high or heavy

391
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
I will do my best

392
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
to make you a child

393
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Princess, drink

394
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
You two, come with me

395
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
It's not the winter yet

396
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Why is it so cold

397
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
I have to leave the waterway

398
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
I can't even get a car

399
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Can I still get to Yizhan?

400
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Let's just bear with it

401
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
The more you go north, the colder it gets

402
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
In a few days, the flood will be in the cave

403
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
I can't go through the waterway

404
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
You are so wise

405
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
It's so cold

406
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
How long will I stand there and watch

407
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
My wife

408
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
It's easy to catch a cold in the wind

409
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Let's go in

410
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
This tea is our specialty

411
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Don't mind it

412
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Have some tea

413
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Xiaowan, this is delicious, try it

414
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Yunrong Mountain is famous for its tea

415
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
The tea here is really delicious

416
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Princess, sisters

417
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
We finally found the carriage

418
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
But it's getting dark

419
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm afraid we have to find a place to complain tonight

420
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Manager

421
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Is there a hotel nearby where we can stay?

422
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
There is one in front

423
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
The guests have been walking along the road

424
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
They will be there after passing the village

425
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
It's just

426
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
What's wrong?

427
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
It's just that the village has been not peaceful for a few months

428
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
It's not peaceful in this village

429
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
If you go there, you'd better leave early

430
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
It's too dangerous when it gets dark

431
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Manager, how can this village not be peaceful?

432
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
I heard that this village is haunted

433
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
It will eat people when it gets dark

434
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
There is no ghost in the world

435
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Yes, I'm here

436
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
I'm not afraid of any ghosts

437
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Don't be so suspicious

438
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
You don't have to believe these rumors

439
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
The carriage has stopped at the intersection

440
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Let's get on the carriage

441
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Be careful

442
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Let's go

443
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Let's go

444
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Don't look

445
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Let's go

446
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Let's go

447
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Don't go

448
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Don't

449
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Sister Jiu

450
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Let's go

451
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
What's the matter with you?

452
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Yes

453
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Besides, I'm here

454
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Xiaowan, let's go

455
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Bai

456
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Let's go

457
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
You are here

458
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Come inside

459
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
It's going to snow

460
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
I'm the best place

461
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
The room is clean

462
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
You can rest assured

463
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Come inside

464
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Let's drink tea

465
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Please

466
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Manager, arrange it quickly

467
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
I'm starving

468
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Xiaowan

469
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Manager

470
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,340
Why is there garlic and

471
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
We heard that there was a ghost nearby

472
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Since you know

473
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
I won't hide it

474
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
There was a tea garden in the back mountain

475
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
The business was very good

476
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
But half a year ago

477
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
There were many people dead in the garden

478
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
The young workers

479
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
Suddenly disappeared

480
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
When they found the body

481
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
All the weapons were taken away

482
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
The garden was emptied

483
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
It's a miserable death

484
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
Could it be

485
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
The beast-hunting businessmen in the mountains

486
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
The hunters almost turned over the mountain

487
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
I didn't see the shadow of the beast

488
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
After such a big thing

489
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Has the government never asked?

490
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
The government has been investigating for several months

491
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Nothing was found

492
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
This is the way to find out the monster

493
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
But you can rest assured

494
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
Since the tea garden was closed

495
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,340
The people have been dead for more than a month

496
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
But we are not monsters

497
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Why are the villagers so ignorant about us?

498
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
Villagers are ignorant

499
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,340
It's because there are too many outsiders

500
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Too much

501
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Brought dirty things into the village

502
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,340
So these troubles came

503
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,340
So this Sanyuan Village

504
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
It's like this now

505
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Thief

506
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Thief

507
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Thief

508
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,340
Thief

509
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,340
My Thief

510
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
Slow down

511
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Thief

512
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,340
How can you let your grandmother live?

513
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,340
My Thief

514
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,340
Little sister

515
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Hurry up, follow her

516
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Thief

517
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Why did you become like this?

518
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,340
My Thief

519
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Thief

520
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Slow down

521
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
The old Feng family has become a dead man

522
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,340
What do you mean?

523
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,340
I am the old Feng in the east

524
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
My son and daughter were killed by the monster

525
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,340
I only live with my granddaughter

526
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
Look at this

527
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,340
God bless

528
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,340
My inn must not be in trouble

529
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Little sister

530
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
This place cannot be left for a long time

531
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
Let those outsiders get out

532
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Get out

533
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Let those outsiders get out

534
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Get out

535
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Don't be so bold

536
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Get out

537
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,340
What are you doing?

538
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Get these outsiders out

539
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Our Sanyuan Village has been in a bad situation for a few days

540
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
When these outsiders come

541
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,340
The village is in a crisis

542
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
If these outsiders stay

543
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,340
Who is the next one to die?

544
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
Let these outsiders get out of the Sanyuan Village

545
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Get out

546
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Get out

547
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Listen to me

548
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
The bad women

549
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Take these people out

550
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
What are you doing?

551
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I won't let you go

552
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,340
I said I won't let you go

553
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Get out

554
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
Get out

555
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,340
Get out

556
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
Get out

557
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Get out

558
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
Brother, it's windy and cold here

559
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,340
If we really hit the village, we will be hurt

560
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Don't be afraid, sister

561
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,800
Maybe the

562
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Go

563
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Don't go

564
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
It's dangerous

565
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Stop

566
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Master Sun

567
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Master Sun

568
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Master Sun

569
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Master Sun

570
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Master Sun

571
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Master Sun

572
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Master Sun

573
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Master Sun

574
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Why are you so nervous?

575
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm looking at the old lady

576
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I heard you were in a hurry

577
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
It's snowing

578
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
At this time

579
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Isn't it pushing people to death?

580
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
No

581
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Brother

582
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Brother Sun

583
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
Go back

584
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Sister

585
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Why are you here?

586
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Let me introduce to you

587
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
This is our legendary

588
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Sun Hao Yue

589
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,260
Nice to meet you

590
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
This is our junior

591
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Qin Wan

592
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Since you started to study

593
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
She is our master's favorite

594
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Hello sister

595
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
You two

596
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Are the senior of sister Jiu

597
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I'm Waner's third brother

598
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Today I am lucky to meet two

599
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
The two magicians of the Medicine Valley

600
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
It's an honor

601
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Mr. Qin

602
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Let's go

603
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Where to go?

604
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Let's go to the senior's prairie

605
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
I won't let you live here

606
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Where else can I go?

607
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
Master

608
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
You are back

609
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Uncle Dong

610
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
How is your wife?

611
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
She is fine

612
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
These are my friends

613
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Please arrange the bamboo

614
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I'll go see my wife

615
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Ok

616
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
The doctor is so rude

617
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
My wife has a serious illness

618
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
The young master always takes care of her personally

619
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Never be too hard on her

620
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Not only is there a doctor

621
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,180
Please forgive me

622
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
I'm sorry

623
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm sorry

624
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,180
The house is big

625
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,180
Feel free

626
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Like your own home

627
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,180
Thank you

628
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Please

629
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,180
This way

630
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Senior

631
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Where is Yan?

632
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
How dare he let you go into the well alone?

633
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
You are talking nonsense

634
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Yan is not my bodyguard

635
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
He always follows me

636
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Let me tell you

637
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Thanks to Haoyue this time

638
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Otherwise you would be homeless

639
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Where is Yan?

640
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Senior

641
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Why are you here?

642
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
I'm here to see you

643
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
I'm here to see you

644
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Senior is here

645
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Let me tell you

646
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
After I left Jingzhou

647
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
I heard there is a kind person in Yunwu

648
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
I came here

649
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
And I met

650
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
You are Haoyue

651
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
You are Haoyue

652
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Since he was born

653
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
We haven't seen each other for many years

654
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
This meeting is our destiny

655
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
We three

656
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
We should have a good chat

657
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Ok

658
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Xiaowan, hurry up

659
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Hurry up

660
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
I'm freezing

661
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
The treatment is to release the white fruit

662
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Thank you, Senior

663
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Such a big house

664
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Just like on the boat

665
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
I'm going to scold you

666
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Although it's a little cold here

667
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
But the atmosphere is good

668
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
I heard Senior's wife is not very good

669
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
This is a good place for her

670
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Your senior is a doctor

671
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
Why can't you treat your wife?

672
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
I'm not a doctor

673
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
I can't cure myself

674
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
My lady

675
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,020
I'll send the white fruit

676
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
I'll go and help you

677
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
Fulin, give me mine

678
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
Come

679
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
No

680
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
My lady, let me help you

681
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
No need, you can help Xiaowan

682
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Let's go to the garden

683
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
No, I won't

684
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
It's too early

685
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
I need to sleep

686
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
There are no monsters in this world

687
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
But Feng's granddaughter's arm

688
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
The bones are not blood

689
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
There is no blood on the floor

690
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
It's all blood

691
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Especially human power

692
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
How long will you stay in Jingzhou?

693
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
When I catch the traitor

694
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
I'll come to chase you

695
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Don't worry

696
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
If the crown prince helps

697
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I can make the monster come to life

698
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
But

699
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
When will he come?

700
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Master, do you want to rest for a while?

701
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Fu Xing, it's snowing again

702
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
If the snow horse doesn't run fast

703
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,940
It's harder to catch them

704
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
They must have been riding all day

705
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Don't be so anxious

706
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,940
Let's go

707
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Come

708
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Come

709
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Lady Qin, I didn't scare you

710
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
This is the young master's patient

711
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Why did you lock the patient here?

712
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
If the patient has a strange disease

713
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,860
It often hurts

714
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,860
What's wrong with him?

715
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
He will be like this when he gets sick

716
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
So the young master left him to be treated

717
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
In case he hurts

718
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
Lady Qin, you go to other places

719
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
I want to serve him to take medicine

720
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Thank you

721
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Miss Shi, you okay?

722
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
I'm fine

723
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Are you going to pay your respects to the sister-in-law?

724
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,780
I haven't been there yet

725
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,780
I'll take you with me

726
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Okay

727
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,780
Are you okay?

728
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I am fine

729
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
How about you?

730
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,460
Your melted eyes.

731
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,900
Ş segregation.

732
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,660
Sing it up.

733
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,740
Sixth Senior Brother Apparently,

734
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,780
Senior Brother is his his disciple.

735
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,180
Sixth Senior Brother,

736
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,940
and then you.

737
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,940
This is my brother, Bai Fei Jue.

738
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Thank you, Senior Brother.

739
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Greetings, Mr. Bai.

740
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,940
Thank you for your help.

741
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,940
We're going to a place where we can rest in peace.

742
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
We're very grateful.

743
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
You don't have to be so formal.

744
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,940
We don't have to be formal.

745
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,940
Although the grassland is simple,

746
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,940
it's still wide and open.

747
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,940
You can take a look around.

748
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,940
It's more interesting than the Demon King Valley.

749
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,940
I heard that you're not feeling well.

750
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,940
After I greet you,

751
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,940
I'll definitely enjoy it.

752
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,940
You're right.

753
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,940
I should have let Fei Yan, the head of the family,

754
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,940
take care of you.

755
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
But she's not feeling well.

756
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,940
She's not in good health.

757
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,940
You said you didn't have to be so formal.

758
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,940
But you're the most formal.

759
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,940
Alright. Let's go see Fei Yan.

760
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,940
It's rare for you to care about Fei Yan.

761
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,940
Then, follow me.

762
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,940
This way, please.

763
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,940
This way, please.

764
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,940
