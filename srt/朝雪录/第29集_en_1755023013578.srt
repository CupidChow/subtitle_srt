00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,820
Our intelligence says

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,430
that Wang Xin has been spotted
in the southeast of the city.

5
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,360
Starting today,

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,990
all the mills in this area

7
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,650
must be thoroughly searched.

8
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,400
The Patrol Battalion will be stationed

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
at all major roads in the southeast.

10
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,680
Prefect Zheng will command
from the prefect's office.

Princess Yongci and Princess Yongning

12
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,120
will assist Prefect Zheng
with coordination.

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,250
Yes, Your Highness.

take the rest of the men

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,110
and go undercover as civilians
for an investigation.

21
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,070
Be it a winery, oil mill,

22
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,880
or grain mill,

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,540
keep watch on them all.

[Guangshun Mill]

26
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,120
Understood!

27
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Oh, he's fine-looking.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,070
Judging from the calluses
on the victim's fingers,

29
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,340
he must have been a craftsman
skilled in fine carving.

30
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,250
Prefect Zheng,

31
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,720
please invite Ning Buyi over
to draw a portrait of the deceased.

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
Half of his face is gone.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,320
Can he really draw it?

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,390
Portrait artists must first
master facial contours.

35
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,050
Mr. Ning has done this before.

36
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,510
Given his artistic skills,

37
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,970
it shouldn't be a problem.

38
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,350
Based on the rigor mortis

39
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,080
and the dried blood condition,

40
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,020
this person had been killed

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,640
before we searched the mill.

42
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,570
The killer set a trap here in advance.

43
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,040
This millstone is kind of far
from the door,

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,350
and there are no signs of fight

45
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,610
or resistance around.

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,920
This suggests

47
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,560
the victim willingly walked to this spot,

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,779
neither resisting

49
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,570
nor attempting to escape.

50
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,790
It indicates that the victim

51
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,120
not only knew the killer

52
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,850
but also trusted him or her very much.

53
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,550
The crime likely occurred late at night.

54
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,170
The killer hung the millstone in advance,

55
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,000
drew the pattern,

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,460
and waited for the victim.

57
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,750
When the victim walked
from the courtyard into the warehouse,

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,310
it'd be hard to soon spot
the pattern on the ground

59
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,790
and the hanging millstone.

60
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,870
Meanwhile, the killer distracted

61
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,230
the victim's attention on purpose.

62
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,840
The victim had no idea

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,700
that he was walking to his demise.

64
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,880
Judging from the marks on the beam,

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,910
the person who cut the rope

66
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,570
was likely hiding on the beam.

67
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,010
Given the cut on this rope,

68
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,970
it should have been sliced twice.

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,110
The killer probably
cut halfway through the rope

70
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,570
in advance in case he or she

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
couldn't sever it in one stroke.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
But this smooth end of the cut

73
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,750
was severed in one clean stroke.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,610
It looks like it was cut with a saw,

75
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,770
but the saw marks

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,440
are much thinner
than those of an ordinary saw.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,280
I got it.

78
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,190
It was done with a toothless saw
used by jade carvers,

79
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,920
which can precisely control
the depth of the cut.

80
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,409
Are you suggesting

81
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,280
that the killer is still Wang Xin?

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,470
We need the facial portrait

83
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,930
for a final confirmation.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,430
Mr. Ning.

85
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,230
Sorry, guys.

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,670
The...

87
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,710
The victim's face

88
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,790
is truly

89
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,560
too horrific to look at.

90
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,470
I understand.

91
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,250
Thank you for your effort.

92
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,600
Please draw a portrait of the victim.

93
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,030
Mr. Ning,

94
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,750
with your artistic skills,

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,640
it shouldn't be a problem
to draw the victim's full face

96
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,790
based on his remaining facial features,

97
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,790
I suppose.

98
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,360
I will

99
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,920
do my best.

100
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,840
You drew it perfectly

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,520
from just half a damaged face!

102
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,520
It's such a waste
that you work for merchants,

103
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,790
Mr. Ning.

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,010
I'm flattered, Prefect Zheng.

105
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,790
Since I have

106
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,040
fortunately pulled it off,

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,800
I will

108
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,230
take my leave now.

109
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,110
Please.

110
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,480
Just now,
when Ning Buyi was "throwing up,

111
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
I saw in the water's reflection
that he didn't actually

112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,640
vomit anything,
only making retching sounds.

113
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,820
I also noticed

114
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,790
that when Ning Buyi drew
Wu Qian's portrait for the first time,

115
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,390
he also retched with nausea.

116
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,570
He had one hand on the coffin

117
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,790
and one hand on his leg,

118
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,310
with his body bent forward.

119
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,790
But someone who suddenly feels nauseous

120
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,550
would typically hold
their chest and stomach

121
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,880
to ease the discomfort.

122
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,720
After vomiting,

123
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,230
a person's face or eyes would

124
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,820
usually turn red
from holding their breath

125
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,950
with watering eyes.

126
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,460
But that day,

127
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,190
his complexion remained normal,

128
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,520
and his eyes were clear.

129
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,240
He clearly wasn't afraid,

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,409
yet he pretended to be frightened.

131
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,840
Ning Buyi

132
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,200
is suspicious.

133
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,770
Judging from this,

134
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,830
Ning Buyi is very likely

135
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,760
the real culprit behind this case.

136
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,240
How can you judge
from a suspect's portrait

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,310
that Ning Buyi

138
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,190
is the real murderer?

139
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,070
Because the victim of this murder

140
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,310
is actually the carver who fled days ago,

141
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,070
Wang Xin.

142
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I made

143
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,000
this clay sculpture
using the victim's head

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,790
as a model.

145
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,400
It matches Ning Buyi's first portrait

146
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,640
of Wang Xin.

147
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,920
At that time,

148
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,050
he wanted us to track down Wang Xin,

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
so he didn't falsify the portrait.

150
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,920
The thick calluses
on the victim's right fingers

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,400
and the scratches on his left hand

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,830
prove that he was engaged
in detailed carving work.

153
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,230
This perfectly matches Wang Xin's traits.

154
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,880
With Ning Buyi's drawing skills,

155
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,120
it's impossible that he couldn't
get the victim's true face.

156
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,500
He deliberately
drew Wang Xin as someone else.

157
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,430
He must have had ulterior motives.

158
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
So Ning Buyi

159
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,490
destroyed Wang Xin's head on purpose

160
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,990
and cut the rope
with a jade carver's toothless saw

161
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,500
just to make us believe

162
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,070
that Wang Xin was the murderer.

163
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,880
To cover up his crime, Ning Buyi

164
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,790
deliberately altered the victim's portrait

165
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,240
to look different from Wang Xin.

166
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,300
Comparing it with my clay sculpture,

167
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,360
it further proves

168
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,090
that he already knew
the victim's true identity.

169
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,120
Only someone very familiar with Wang Xin

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
would know

171
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,280
how to make subtle adjustments

172
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,880
to achieve similar facial contours

173
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,280
but a different face.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
If he weren't the murderer,

175
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,600
how would he know the victim was Wang Xin

176
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,430
and go to such lengths to conceal it?

177
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,430
But what if Ning Buyi

178
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,760
keeps denying
he drew it wrong on purpose?

179
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,080
So we still need evidence.

Lord Yan that I've been

183

missing day and night?

184
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,790
And who are you, miss?

for a few days,

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,940
Let's have a drink another day.

190
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,980
Yan Li,

191
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,830
how dare you cheat on me

192
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,050
and betray my sincere feelings?

193
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,180
I'll go smash the gates
of Prince Yi's Mansion right now!

194
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,590
What...

195
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,040
What's going on?

196
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,160
You didn't even let me explain
before hitting me!

197
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,530
Are you zoning out?

198
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,710
Keep acting!

199
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,290
Your Highness,

200
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,640
I'll be waiting for you.

201
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,810
Your Highness,

202
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,450
why aren't you going after Her Highness?

203
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,360
Given that loud slap,
why should I chase after her

204
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,760
to take another beating?

205
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,470
Her Highness

206
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,280
seems to have genuine feelings for you.

207
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Your Highness,

208
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,010
if you give her yours as well...

209
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,310
Genuine feelings?

210
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,040
I don't have that many to spare!

211
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,350
I see you have

212
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,000
quite a few interesting items here.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,190
I can pick some presents for her

214
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,400
just to calm her down.

215
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,640
As it happens,

216
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,570
I recently acquired a small dagger

217
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,640
with a sheath inlaid with seven gems,
quite exquisite.

218
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,370
Her Highness

219
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,720
will like it, I think.

220
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
Fine,

221
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,920
that's it.

222
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,070
I've left it in my study at home.

223
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,160
I still have

224
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,880
something to handle this afternoon.

225
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,190
If you don't mind,

226
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,950
you could condescend to visit

227
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,610
my humble abode after dinner.

228
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,950
Fine,

229
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,970
it's a deal.

230
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,360
Let Bai Feng go in my place?

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,040
Why?

232
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
This mission is too risky

233
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,760
for someone of your noble status.

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,290
Exactly.

235
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,830
Besides, I know you well

236
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,590
with a similar build,

237
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,120
making it more convincing.

238
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,070
No way.

239
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,850
Ning Buyi isn't blind.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,790
Given my handsome face and charm,

241
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,520
how could you possibly impersonate me?

242
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,920
I...

243
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,880
How are we alike at all?

244
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,360
What on earth do you want?

245
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,820
It's all for your own good.

246
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
I want to go in person.

247
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,950
I know best what to do.

248
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,310
As for the danger,

249
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,670
it's dangerous for anyone.

250
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,670
You won't let me go

251
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,920
because you're afraid
I'll steal all the credit?

252
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,760
Or is it that

253
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,670
you look down on me
like those people

254
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,640
in the capital?

255
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,160
If you're worried about my safety,

256
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,020
Prefect Zheng,

257
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,240
just send more men

258
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,760
to surround that bastard's house.

259
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,960
Bai Feng, Zhan Yang,

260
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,710
you two just put in more effort

261
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,910
to get me out quickly.

262
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,040
Ning Buyi is cruel by nature

263
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,170
and cunning in mind.

264
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,400
If he finds out our suspicion of him,

265
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,150
he might go even more brutal.

266
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,830
You must be extremely careful.

267
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,550
In this pouch,

268
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,830
the small one is the antidote;

269
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,950
the large one is to heal wounds.

270
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,750
You must not let your guard down.

271
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,010
The eagle whistle?

272
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,040
No.

273
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,240
Chi gave it to you for your safety.

274
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,100
I can't take it.

275
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,830
Take it.

276
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,280
As long as you're alive,

277
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,430
no matter how severe your injuries,

278
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,630
I can heal you anyway.

279
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,100
Little Wan'er,

280
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,830
you have my full support

281
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,630
as Chi's wife!

282
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,590
Ning.

283
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,640
Stop talking

284
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,490
as if we're saying our final goodbyes.

285
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,080
Just remember

286
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,210
that we will

287
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,280
be besties forever.

288
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,240
Okay.

289
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Besties forever.

290
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,550
It's about time.

291
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,950
Let's go.

292
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,550
Please.

293
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,200
This is pretty good!

294
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,880
You're great at making tea.

295
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,200
Just a minute, Your Highness.

296
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm going

297
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,160
to get you the dagger.

298
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,070
Go ahead.

299
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,430
Why is it wet?

300
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,600
Stay calm.

301
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,620
Can't lose the eagle whistle too.

302
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,780
Your Highness.

303
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,310
Oh, no.

304
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,430
Ning Buyi,

305
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,720
if you keep coughing,

306
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,400
I just can't fake passing out anymore.

307
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,560
Stop!

308
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,800
Kill me if you want to,

309
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,460
but don't lust after my nice body.

310
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,119
You woke up pretty fast.

311
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,730
With your puny build,

312
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,640
how much strength could you have?

313
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,839
I was just pretending
to be unconscious to play along,

314
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,640
and you really thought you succeeded.

315
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,470
You fool.

316
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,880
You think you can make me end your life

317
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,080
in a fast and easy way by infuriating me?

318
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,840
Be patient.

319
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,370
I'll avoid your vital spots

320
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,250
and use this dagger

321
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,400
to saw your body

322
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,870
bit

323
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,300
by bit

324
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,710
until you're split in half.

325
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,560
So you can see your own

326
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,710
internal organs.

327
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,320
I never thought I'd die

328
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,840
such a heroic death.

329
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,180
How thrilling!

330
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,090
So

331
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,250
you like being a heroic man.

332
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,770
How could I possibly grant you that wish?

333
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,470
How about...

334
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,470
Ning Buyi!

335
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,010
Kill me now if you've got the guts!

336
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,190
Chi!

337
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,170
Where on earth is Yan Li?

338
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
We've fallen into a trap.

339
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,430
Ning Buyi deliberately left
a fake secret passage.

340
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,390
But he couldn't escape this mansion.

341
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,970
Bai Feng!

342
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,840
Continue the search!

343
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,190
Yes!

344
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,400
Zhan Yang, search the house.

345
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,920
Yes.

346
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,500
Yan Chi,

347
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,230
look,

348
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,510
a secret channel.

349
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,030
Ning Buyi.

350
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,030
I've never done anything evil in my life.

351
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,270
According to your
Heavenly Way Society's rules,

352
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,470
you can't kill me yet.

353
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,990
Heavenly Way Society?

354
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,810
Heavenly Way Society!

355
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,430
So you know
about our Heavenly Way Society.

356
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,640
Very good!

357
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,490
Good.

358
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Then you should know

359
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,100
that you

360
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,400
spent your days in brothels
with seductresses,

361
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,030
deceiving Princess Yongning's affections,

362
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,190
and you deserve

363
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,710
a sawing-execution!

364
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,710
I'm innocent!

365
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,840
I'm still...

366
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,470
Still a pure virgin.

367
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,310
I just fear sleeping alone,

368
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,920
so I visited those brothels every day.

369
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,990
I'm deeply in love

370
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,320
with Ning.

371
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,620
We've made a vow to be together forever.

372
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,750
We already spent the night together
in the Fengqi House.

373
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,410
Say one more lie,

374
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,160
and I'll tear your mouth apart.

375
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,920
Come on,

376
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,810
Your Highness.

377
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,220
Are you alright, Your Highness?

378
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,990
Yan Li!

379
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,020
Where is Yan Li?

380
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,330
This way.

381
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,120
He's there.

382
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,390
I'm going to chop you to pieces!

383
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,550
Stop right there!

384
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,060
I'll beat yo up!

385
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,250
Get back here!

386
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,010
At least His Highness is alive.

387
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,420
His way of living

388
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
isn't easy at all.

389
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Princess Yongci,

390
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,190
when did you start suspecting me?

391
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,230
It doesn't matter
when I began suspecting you.

392
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,120
If you hadn't killed Wang Xin
to silence him,

393
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,580
which gave yourself away,

394
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,330
my suspicions would have
remained just that.

395
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,950
He

396
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,170
brought it upon himself.

397
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,480
I had to kill him.

398
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,920
They all deserved death.

399
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,200
Greedy people

400
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,410
should be crushed by stones.

401
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,490
Were you
behind Guanyin Town's case too?

402
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,910
Back then,

403
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,310
my work wasn't perfect.

404
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,240
Many things

405
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,590
need to come to an end now.

406
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,140
But you formed the Heavenly Way Society.

407
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,440
The Heavenly Way Society.

408
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,420
If you want to kill me,

409
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,470
then do it.

410
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,120
But if I can survive,

411
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,800
I swear I will kill you

412
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,750
for the great path!

413
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,270
Then tell me

414
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,200
what crime I have committed.

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,070
The blood on my hands

416
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,110
pale in comparison to the innocent lives

417
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,870
killed in one battle of yours,

418
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,260
Your Highness.

419
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,040
How dare you

420
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,580
compare yourself to soldiers
who defend our country?

421
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,750
History is written by the victors.

422
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,820
Judge me as you will.

423
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,710
It's just a pity

424
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,380
that my great cause

425
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,150
remains unfinished.

426
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,500
He was determined to kill himself.

427
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,690
Let's end

428
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,720
this case here.

429
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,410
Close the doors!

430
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,610
Let no one in or out!

431
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes, sir.

432
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,670
-Don't close the doors!
-Who are you?

433
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,160
Open your eyes and look carefully.

434
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
I am the Heir of Prince Yi.

435
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,800
Open the doors now!

436
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,360
Forgive me,

437
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,740
Your Highness. Open the doors now!

438
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,120
Yan Li, stop right there!

439
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,430
That person's impersonating
Princess Yongning.

440
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,080
Stop her!

441
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,470
Yes!

442
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,810
And don't hurt her.

443
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,230
How dare you call me an impostor?

444
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,760
-Help!
-I'll kill you!

445
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,840
It's him.

446
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,540
His skin shows signs
of depleted Qi and blood.

447
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,760
Even if he hadn't killed himself,

448
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,490
he would still die in a few days.

449
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,710
Seems like this unrighteous flower

450
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,440
is indeed the symbol
of the Heavenly Way Society.

451
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,130
No wonder when Zhang Dongxuan
left the Society,

452
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,880
he had to cut out the flesh
from his chest.

453
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
It was to conceal the existence
of the Heavenly Way Society.

454
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,680
Knowing his days were numbered,

455
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,840
he still went to such lengths

456
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,230
to kill so many people.

457
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,290
So this is what they call
"carrying out the heavenly way"?

458
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,220
[Capital Prefecture]

459
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,800
The mask is made from camphor wood,

460
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,860
painted white,

461
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,800
and carefully crafted to match

462
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,460
Ning Buyi's facial features.

463
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,180
Camphor wood is rigid.

464
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,750
Unless someone has exactly

465
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,270
the same facial contours as Ning Buyi,

466
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,670
no one else could wear it.

467
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,950
And the white color
has faded into dull yellow,

468
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,750
indicating it was made long ago.

469
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,720
It seems that you know this mask.

470
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,640
The white mask

471
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,080
is specific for the Society Leader,

472
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,710
while the Deputy Society Leader wears

473
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,030
a silver mask.

474
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,670
So that means

475
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,110
Ning Buyi was
the Heavenly Way Society Leader?

476
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,840
Finally, we caught the real culprit

477
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,510
behind these murders in the capital.

478
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,970
But other accomplices
have yet to be purged.

479
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Ning Buyi is dead.

480
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,760
All we can do is stay on guard.

481
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,740
Prefect Zheng,

482
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,360
please dispatch more men
to patrol inside and outside the city,

483
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,080
hunting down the Society members.

484
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,210
Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,080
Master, Your Highness,

486
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,320
we've figured out
Ning Buyi's background.

487
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,900
Both River Min and River Qin
suffered flooding.

488
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,640
The court raised disaster relief grain,

489
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,300
which Prince Yu
personally escorted to Huzhou.

490
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,950
However, in Huzhou Prefecture,

491
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,920
the Deputy Surveillance Commissioner,

492
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,840
Ning Shoude,

493
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,870
embezzled relief funds,

494
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,840
causing failed disaster relief.

495
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
Ning Shoude showed no remorse,

496
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,430
denied all charges,

497
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,840
and was hence sentenced to death

498
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,600
with his property confiscated

499
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,470
and his descendants

500
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,930
barred from taking imperial examinations.

501
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,500
Ning Shoude

502
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,320
was Ning Buyi's father.

503
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,080
As a mere deputy commissioner, no way he

504
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,680
had the guts to embezzle all.

505
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,750
It was only because Prince Yu

506
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,160
was His Majesty's uncle

507
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,270
that no one dared investigate him.

508
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,400
His father was merely

509
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,320
a scapegoat for the real embezzler.

510
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,650
With both parents dead,

511
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,350
no wonder he resented heaven's injustice.

512
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,880
Wan,

513
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,730
I need to talk to you.

514
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,300
What's wrong?

515
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,520
Did it remind you of the injustice
done to Mr. Shen just now?

516
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,190
Yes.

517
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,030
When I think about
those in court who suffered

518
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,920
like my father...

519
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,160
Ning Buyi's father wasn't
in the same situation as Mr. Shen.

520
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,620
Though Ning Shoude wasn't

521
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,160
the main culprit,
he was not innocent either.

522
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,490
His execution was just.

523
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,160
Indeed.

524
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,990
If Ning Buyi wanted real justice,

525
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,990
he should have tried to make Prince Yu
confess and face punishment

526
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,470
instead of killing commoners

527
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,330
to vent his personal grievances.

528
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,590
I was wrong.

529
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,760
You weren't wrong.

530
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,230
You're just way too kind-hearted,

531
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,670
putting yourself in others' shoes.

532
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,930
A mistake is a mistake.

533
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,680
You don't need to comfort me.

534
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,640
When investigating cases,

535
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,360
one should never
project feelings onto others.

536
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,470
I jumped to conclusions

537
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,990
without reviewing all the files

538
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,250
and even revealed
my emotions to others.

539
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,600
I did it wrong.

540
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,430
Though Prefect Zheng and Zhan Yang

541
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,650
aren't gossips,

542
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,800
in the future,

543
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,230
you should still be careful
what you say around them.

544
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,080
Thank you for your candid advice.

545
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,410
It's my biggest fortune

546
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,370
to have such a nice husband.

547
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,470
I heard that the perpetrator

548
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,840
has been brought to justice.

549
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,700
You did well

550
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,430
in solving this case.

551
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,800
Your Majesty,

552
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,430
Princess Yongning
played a significant role

553
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,020
in cracking this case.

554
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,780
Prefect Zheng Baishi also

555
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,330
coordinated excellently.

556
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,430
Princess Yongci
deserves reward for her merit,

557
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,710
but you must be punished

558
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,840
for your faults too.

559
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,430
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

560
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,990
The suspect of embezzling military rations
has been in the capital for days,

561
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,760
yet

562
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,410
the case remains unsolved.

563
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,160
I wonder if you're ignoring

564
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,320
my decree,

565
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,670
merely going through the motions,

566
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,690
or if it's because

567
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,710
the internal affairs of the Shuoxi Army

568
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,030
are tangled and complex,

569
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,890
making it

570
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,690
thorny for you to take action?

571
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,400
Your Majesty,

572
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,800
I have confirmed

573
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,670
the existence of corrupt officials
in the Shuoxi Army

574
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,640
betraying for profit,

575
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,990
but I'm still gathering evidence

576
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,670
for a report to you, Your Majesty.

577
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,160
I stake my life on it

578
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,720
that these corrupt ones
in the Shuoxi Army

579
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,810
cannot undermine
its fundamental integrity.

580
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,950
My father's management
did have some oversights,

581
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,190
but all the soldiers under his command

582
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,640
serve with absolute loyalty

583
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,670
and would never conspire

584
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,800
to deceive you, Your Majesty.

585
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,600
I hope you will see through this.

586
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,670
Come.

587
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,240
Come up here.

588
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,800
Help me

589
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,430
light this lamp.

590
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,880
Yes.

591
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,710
Your Majesty, please

592
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,970
take back the igniter.

593
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,290
Are you

594
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,230
sulking at me?

595
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,530
I wouldn't dare.

596
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,740
Then why

597
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,600
are you returning

598
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,690
this igniter to me?

599
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,670
This igniter

600
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,500
belongs to you, Your Majesty.

601
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,040
So, of course it should
be returned to you.

602
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,400
I

603
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,820
merely gave my subordinates

604
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,680
the duty of lighting the lamp,

605
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,840
not bestowing

606
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,860
the igniter itself upon them.

607
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,430
Yet some people are pretending

608
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
not to understand

609
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,110
such a simple truth.

610
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,080
Your father and I

611
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,880
are brothers,

612
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,170
but

613
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,220
we are also ruler and subject.

614
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,080
If he cannot eradicate

615
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,920
the hidden dangers in the Shuoxi Army,

616
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,510
I

617
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,030
am afraid

618
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,330
I won't be able to rest assured.

619
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,870
All under the sky is the emperor's domain;

620
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,320
all within the realm
are the emperor's subjects.

621
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,120
Your Majesty, please

622
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,360
permit my departure to Shuoxi

623
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,670
to root out those corrupt officials,

624
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,920
uphold Your Majesty's authority,

625
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,320
and set your mind at ease.

626
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,030
Very well.

627
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,600
You may go.

628
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,920
Keep this matter

629
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,840
between us.

630
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,830
As long as you and your father

631
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,320
stay on the same page,

632
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,470
I

633
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,600
will rest assured.

634
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,750
Master,

636
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,010
the Dove Unit's letter

637
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,020
says the Crown Prince
has delivered the military supplies.

638
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,190
But during the handover,

639
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,190
the Chief General found our men
secretly checking the accounts.

640
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,510
He punished them with lashings

641
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,570
and locked them up.

642
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,960
Father is truly being foolish.

643
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,650
He's adamantly protecting
those Shuoxi officials.

644
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,850
Everyone would think

645
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,650
he considers the Shuoxi Army
his personal force.

646
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
His Majesty is already
displeased about this.

647
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,430
If we don't take initiative

648
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,560
to hand over those corrupt officials,

649
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,920
His Majesty will certainly use this excuse

650
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,250
to take control of the entire Shuoxi Army.

651
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,710
I must rush back to Shuoxi
and confront my father.

652
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,360
You stay in the capital to look after Wan.

653
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,320
If anything goes wrong,

654
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,600
I'll hold you accountable.

655
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,330
Understood.

656
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,230
What if Princess Yongci asks about it?

657
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,330
Tell her I've gone to investigate
the military provision case

658
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,510
and will return as soon as possible.

659
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,640
Yes, Your Highness.

660
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,860
[Capital Prefecture]

661
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,640
Has the murderer

662
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,030
been confirmed to be Ning Buyi?

663
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,510
Ning Buyi was caught

664
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,370
red-handed by Heir of Prince Rui.

665
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,670
He has confessed

666
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,600
to the murders.

667
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,270
We've got solid evidence.

668
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,710
With solid evidence

669
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,960
and the culprit caught in the act,

670
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,250
why did you

671
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,030
make a note at the end

672
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,080
of the case file,

673
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,140
stating this case remains unsolved?

674
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,320
Because the witness,
Zhang Dongxuan, pointed out

675
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,470
that besides Ning Buyi,

676
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,360
the Heavenly Way Society
has other members,

677
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,160
and its Deputy Leader

678
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,490
remains unidentified.

679
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Then do you

680
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,930
have any leads to find this Deputy Leader?

681
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,800
Not yet.

682
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,710
Is there any evidence proving

683
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,120
that it was this Deputy Leader

684
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,320
who ordered Ning Buyi to commit murder?

685
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,160
Since Ning Buyi was the Leader,

686
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,470
who would have the right

687
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,530
to give him orders?

688
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,880
Mr. Zheng,

689
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,600
criminal case documents

690
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,990
should be finished with closed cases.

691
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,190
With the case closed,

692
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,990
it should be considered an end.

693
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,790
Do not

694
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,940
complicate things

695
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,990
by bringing up unresolved issues.

696
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,670
If someday

697
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,470
His Majesty asks about this,

698
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,550
how am I supposed to respond?

699
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,179
Should I

700
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,270
tell His Majesty

701
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,610
that there are still conspirators
to be investigated?

702
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,870
What are you suggesting, Mr. Li?

703
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,400
This case

704
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
has thrown the capital

705
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,469
into panic.

706
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,949
Closing it as soon as possible

707
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,760
would benefit

708
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,070
both His Majesty and the common people.

709
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,030
Moreover,

710
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,580
His Majesty

711
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,920
cherishes the Heir of Prince Yi so much.

712
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,880
If he learns that you put him in danger

713
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,550
for investigation,

714
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,580
His Majesty will place blame,

715
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,590
and I'm afraid

716
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,050
even the Heir of Prince Rui

717
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,270
and Princess Yongci

718
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,760
would face punishment.

719
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,969
Therefore, in my opinion,

720
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,020
this case

721
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,690
should be closed as soon as possible,

722
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,690
which would be

723
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,090
safer for all parties involved.

724
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:50,900
I see.

725
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,760
Thank you for enlightening me.

726
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,239
I will delete that and rewrite the files

727
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,680
before submitting them to His Majesty.

728
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,540
Then congratulations in advance

729
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,070
on your achievements.

730
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,570
Mr. Li,

731
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,520
take care.

732
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,580
Little Wan'er!

733
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,360
Come with me to the palace now.

734
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,220
My brother, Ze, will be here soon.

735
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,470
Who is that?

736
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,820
The Heir of Prince Xin!

737
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,630
We haven't seen each other
for almost ten years.

738
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,400
He ranks third among the cousins,

739
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
and he was the nicest to me
when we were young.

740
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,720
The late Princess Xin and Chi's mother

741
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,950
were best friends.

742
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,750
He and Chi have been
on good terms since childhood.

743
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,400
Okay.

744
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,930
Let's go.

745
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,520
[Funing Palace]

746
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,020
Here comes the Heir of Prince Xin.

747
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,040
[Yan Ze, Heir of Prince Xin]

748
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,580
Your Highness.

749
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,360
Greetings, Grandmother.

750
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,990
That's fine.

751
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,650
No need for such formalities.

752
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,760
Ning,

753
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,470
help your brother take a seat.

754
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,190
Ze,

755
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,920
you've been seeking medical treatment
out there for years,

756
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,520
yet your eye condition
still hasn't improved?

757
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,470
Grandmother,

758
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,600
please don't worry.

759
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,240
I've taken a turn for the better.

760
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,320
It's just that my eyes

761
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,920
still can't tolerate bright light,

762
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,650
so I need this medicated cloth.

763
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,280
Let Wan check in on you.

764
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,530
That's exactly my wish.

765
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,920
In fact, I heard about

766
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,070
the medical fairy's fame,

767
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,800
so I rushed back to the capital.

768
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,220
Greetings, Your Highness.

769
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Princess Yongci,

770
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,080
no need for formalities.

771
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,280
Thank you.

772
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,550
Princess Yongci, please

773
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,400
don't make my grandmother worry.

774
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,330
I will invite you

775
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,990
to my residence for a detailed check

776
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,920
another day.

777
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,590
Yes.

778
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,320
Wan,

779
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
how is it?

780
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,590
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

781
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,480
His Highness's external eye problem
has been solved.

782
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,800
Just some toxins remain in the eyes

783
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,240
with stagnant Qi, blood stasis,

784
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,590
and some signs of yin deficiency of liver

785
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,200
and kidney, and phlegm-heat congestion.

786
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,950
Acupuncture and medicinal diet therapy

787
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,240
will certainly heal him.

788
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,840
Good.

789
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,720
With your assurance,

790
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,070
I can rest easy now.

791
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,510
Everyone stay

792
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,280
and dine in my palace today.

793
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,590
Where is Chi?

794
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,280
His Brother Ze has returned,

795
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,470
yet he didn't even come
to the palace to see him.

796
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,400
Bai Feng says

797
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,760
His Highness is away on duty

798
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,360
and will return in a few days.

799
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
The Double Third Festival is approaching.

800
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,760
He mustn't miss it.

801
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,470
On that day,

802
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,570
all of you

803
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,430
must keep me company and make it lively.

804
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

805
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,760
Ze,

806
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,000
have some tea.

807
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,030
Ning,

808
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,240
you don't need to be so careful.

809
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,660
After all these years,

810
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,740
I've been used to it

811
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,890
and can take care of myself.

812
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,240
Ning, come on.

813
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,550
This medicinal tea of mine

814
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,280
can calm the mind and help with sleep.

815
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,400
One cup each,

816
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,260
and we'll all sleep well tonight.

817
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,840
I will

818
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,410
have trouble falling asleep tonight.

819
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,800
Your Highness,

820
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,950
what's wrong with you today?

821
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,210
You've been so gloomy.

822
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,320
If you're feeling bored,

823
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,180
you could go have fun with Lord Li.

824
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,920
Who is he to me?

825
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,590
Why should I go meet him for fun?

826
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,210
Then why are you so moody?

827
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,280
Ever since you saw
the Heir of Prince Xin today,

828
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,740
you've been acting weird.

829
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,110
I...

830
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,050
I'll tell you the truth,

831
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,520
but please don't tell anyone else.

832
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,630
It's the thing

833
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,610
I regret most in my life.

834
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,450
I attended the winter hunt

835
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,480
for the first time when I was six.

836
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,280
The Crown Prince
and Prince Cheng were fighting,

837
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,140
and neither would take me riding,

838
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,470
so I got mad

839
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
and snuck off to the stables myself.

840
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,330
I was caught in the heavy snowstorm

841
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,720
and got lost that day.

842
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,110
Only Ze noticed I was missing.

843
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,380
I was afraid of embarrassment

844
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,880
and didn't want others to see me
in such a miserable state,

845
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,920
so Ze

846
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,030
had to brave the blizzard

847
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,840
and carry me all the way
back to the estate.

848
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,090
As a result, his eyes were hurt
by the snow glare.

849
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,110
That year,

850
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,640
he was just a child himself.

851
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,090
What happened after that?

852
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,590
Then,

853
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,110
Ze's eyes

854
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,890
turned blind.

855
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,630
This lord

856
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,720
is such a good man of integrity.

857
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,030
Did he

858
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,510
gradually lose his sight

859
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,670
or was he completely blind

860
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,030
from that day on?

861
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,360
I think he became blind from that day,
and the imperial physicians

862
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,820
could do nothing about it.

863
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,280
All these years, Ze's been

864
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,310
searching everywhere
for the best physicians.

865
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,770
But from what we saw today,

866
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,260
he hasn't recovered.

867
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,990
Did his eyes

868
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,570
suffer any injury before?

869
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,400
No.

870
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Did he have any eye problems before?

871
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,070
I don't think so.

872
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,550
However,

873
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,720
Ze has always been sickly since childhood.

874
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,950
His eyes would hurt if he looked

875
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,210
at things for too long.

876
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,630
If I hadn't been that willful,

877
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,410
how could he have become so ill?

878
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,990
I must pay for

879
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,490
my wrongdoing.

880
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,840
I want

881
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,150
to marry him

882
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,760
and take care of him
for the rest of his life.

883
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,510
Why?

884
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,880
That was an unintentional mistake
you made as a child.

885
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Why should you pay for it
with your entire life?

886
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,360
Because no noble lady from the capital

887
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,630
would marry a disabled
and idle imperial clansman.

888
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,030
Since my recklessness

889
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
caused Ze to lose

890
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,130
his chance at lifelong happiness,

891
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,800
I can't abandon him now.

892
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,390
I must take responsibility for him.

893
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,550
But marriage should be based
on mutual affection.

894
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,840
You can't let mere compassion turn

895
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,240
into lifelong compromise.

896
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,880
I...

897
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,240
I'm doing this willingly.

898
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,500
What about Yan Li then?

899
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,320
Yes!

900
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,880
I don't know.

901
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,550
I think

902
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,920
even if I'm not around,

903
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,980
he'll probably still enjoy his life.

904
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,390
What else did Fuling say?

905
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,550
She also said

906
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,070
Princess Yongning has made up her mind.

907
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,550
If you don't do something
to prove yourself,

908
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,510
no one can help you.

909
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,450
I was almost hacked to death.

910
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,580
What else can I do to prove myself?

911
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,590
My once untouched body—

912
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,590
she's seen it

913
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,550
and hugged it.

914
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,360
Now I've caught a cold,

915
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,630
and where is she?

916
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,810
How heartless she is.

917
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
She's seen it

918
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,920
and hugged it?

919
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,610
When did it happen?

920
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,710
That's not the point.

921
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,200
Yeah, yeah.

922
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,280
That's not the point.

923
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,310
What matters is

924
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,640
that Her Highness

925
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,640
doesn't want to hug you anymore.

926
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,360
Bai Feng!

927
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,890
However,

928
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,560
Princess Yongci said

929
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,240
a cold can be fatal.

930
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,470
You'd better be good
and drink your medicine.

931
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,470
If you really die,

932
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,030
not only will Princess Yongci
have to come examine your corpse,

933
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,110
but Princess Yongning

934
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,840
will also go with the Heir of Prince Xin

935
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,450
without any concerns.

936
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,510
- Where are you going?
- I'm not dead!

937
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,920
And she's already planning to remarry!

938
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,380
Take your medicine first.

939
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,810
She's got

940
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,110
some nerve!

941
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,970
Dream on!

942
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,350
[Prince Xin's Mansion]

943
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,250
I heard from Ning

944
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,400
that you've been in poor health
since childhood.

945
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,800
May I ask about the cause?

946
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,800
If you wish to cure your eyes completely,

947
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,060
you must not hide anything
from your physician.

948
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,110
Otherwise,
even if there's temporary relief,

949
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,320
it will soon relapse.

950
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,550
What do you mean, Princess Yongci?

951
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,320
This prescription of oral medicine

952
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,180
only addresses the symptoms
of your organ ailment.

953
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,880
But judging from your pulse,

954
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,070
there's another cause.

955
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,200
I have an assumption

956
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,320
that might explain why your pulse

957
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,550
doesn't match with your organ condition,

958
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,110
but I need your medical history

959
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,200
to confirm it.

960
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,920
I've long forgotten things
from my childhood,

961
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,050
so I cannot tell you.

962
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,590
So,

963
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,240
you know that you

964
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
were poisoned when you were a child.

965
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,970
Medical fairy,

966
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,950
your expertise is truly amazing.

967
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,110
But let the past

968
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,760
be the past.

969
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,240
If I really lose my sight because of it,

970
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,600
then it's just fate playing tricks on me.

971
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Princess Yongci,

972
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,810
please do whatever you can.

973
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,840
Since you have no obsession,
Your Highness,

974
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,240
I will do as you wish.

975
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,220
Your Highness,

976
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,990
please rest early.

977
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,130
Bai Feng?

978
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,060
Your Highness.

979
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,660
Why hasn't Lord Yan Chi returned yet?

980
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,240
His Majesty has some misunderstandings

981
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,400
about Prince Rui
for the military provision case,

982
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,060
so my master had to return
to Shuoxi to handle it.

983
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,930
Then why didn't you go with him?

984
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,360
What if something happens on his way...

985
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,280
Don't worry, Your Highness.

986
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,020
My master knows the road
from Shuoxi to the capital

987
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,920
like the back of his hand.

988
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,250
There won't be any problems.

989
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,330
He left me here

990
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,590
specifically to protect you.

991
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,590
As long as you're safe,

992
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,590
he will be at ease.

993
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,900
What brings you here so late at night?

994
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,110
Something's up
at Prince Jin's residence.
