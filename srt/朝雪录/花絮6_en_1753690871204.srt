1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
William's

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,200
Use your character

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,100
I feel like I am in the movie

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,760
Great

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,260
indeed

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,700
let's do it again

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,580
Moron

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,600
Do you understand it

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,780
I am the hero

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,780
no

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,180
No, I haven't

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,660
You have

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,460
It's too hard

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,980
I'll let you do it

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,380
Bai Feng

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,900
Why are you like this?

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,740
I can lift it up

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,260
I can

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,700
I can lift the top of my head

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,620
It's our bar

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,100
Yes

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,300
It's so tired

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,900
You need a horse and a spring

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,820
Come on, tie me up

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm just a brick

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,940
If you need, let me help you

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,380
Hard touch

28
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,700
One, two, three

29
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,820
One, two, three

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,660
OK, Lanqing

31
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,820
She can't do this

32
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,060
Lanqing has to go

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,340
I'm afraid

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,900
She has to go to her survival

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,780
finish

36
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
be fast

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,180
