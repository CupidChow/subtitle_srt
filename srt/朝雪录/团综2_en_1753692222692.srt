1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Find Zhang Tai and Maidong back

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,960
Maidong invites you to watch

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,000
the five-month big detective

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
The gesture of the thief

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
is very special

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,720
Boss, don't do this again

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,520
It's little fish

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,440
I got it

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,040
It's really not me

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,840
It's too stupid

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,320
It's a wrong case

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Fish of Yu Cheng'an

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,040
It's like this

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,400
Let's play a little game later

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,280
First of all, you three are divided into groups

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,160
The attacker chooses one person as the attacker

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,760
My bell rings a few times

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,720
The defender needs to take a few steps

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,680
The attacker follows the direction of the teammate

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,720
Take the same steps

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,000
If you hit the target, you will be eliminated by one person

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,240
After three times, the two sides exchange identities

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,520
Our declaration is

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,000
How about it

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,240
Our is

26
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,360
One, two, three

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,440
One, two, three

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,800
OK

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,320
Perfect

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,960
The hair is not messy

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
Wait, let me check his eyes

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,360
OK, no problem

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,440
OK

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,560
It's useless

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Defenders choose the starting position

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,960
Ready

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
Just one step

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,840
Just one step

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,480
It's too far

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
He changes his position first

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,480
OK

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,080
There are both sides

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,840
OK

44
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
Jump far

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,480
Have you ever fought for anyone in your life?

46
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,960
Have you ever fought for anyone in your life?

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,200
In this life

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,160
Don't drop your shoes

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,600
Do you like it

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,080
Bravo

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
It's notaya

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,240
You didn't fall down

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,200
At first

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
I Zeus

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,760
Gosh

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
He fell softly

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,320
How can he fall down

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,560
OK

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
Right in front of you

60
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
Let's start from the middle.

61
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
So middle?

62
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
It's okay.

63
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
We'll start from the middle too.

64
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
Five steps.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,720
Go.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,760
Why does it feel like they're all on the ground?

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,240
Is this one step?

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,320
Lan Di.

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,680
The fifth step.

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,360
The last step.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm not going.

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,520
You're talking.

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,280
Lan Di.

74
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm going to use a target.

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,360
It's definitely a middle.

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
I'll measure it.

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,120
You can't tell the distance.

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440
You can only tell the direction.

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,120
Once.

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,760
You choose one.

81
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
So you're going around to...

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,600
Why are you talking again?

83
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
Chen Hongxin.

84
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,520
You should know the direction.

85
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,880
You choose.

86
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,280
I know these two.

87
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Let's try the one without talking.

88
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
Okay, no problem.

89
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Okay.

90
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,320
It's right.

91
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,400
Your right foot

92
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,120
goes to the bottom.

93
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't come over.

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,960
Why are you talking?

95
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,760
Can I do this?

96
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,200
Yes.

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,920
Just use one foot as the center.

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
It's crooked.

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Go away.

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,800
It's all crooked.

101
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,480
I don't want to talk.

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
Are you going to leave including me?

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,480
Soon.

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,440
Get out of here.

105
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,960
We can actually remember each other.

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
But let me back.

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,440
Why are you still saying this?

108
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,920
Why so.

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,440
Now,

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm going to use a target.

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
Did you hit it?

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
Yes

113
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
OK, next

114
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,720
The defender calls

115
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,120
Do you want to kill us?

116
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,080
Don't hit our wig

117
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Accept the trial

118
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,520
Hit our brain

119
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,720
You are crazy

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,640
He is

121
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,040
I can't wait

122
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
I am Tian Jiwei

123
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,720
I just want to win

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I just want to hit people

125
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,520
Let's do it

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
This look is suitable for him

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,000
It's out of breath

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Why did you give it to me?

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
Why is it sticking out?

130
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,960
Come here

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,200
Step 4

132
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,160
OK

133
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,920
Start

134
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,480
Ao Ni

135
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,440
Ao Zi, there's someone behind you.

136
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,960
There's another person on your left.

137
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,440
There's another one here.

138
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Yes.

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400
Then, move to your right.

140
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
Here.

141
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,880
Yes, this position.

142
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm not leaving.

143
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,680
Let's go.

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
Yes.

145
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,520
Three steps.

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Direction.

147
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,120
It hasn't changed yet.

148
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,800
Just go straight ahead.

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes, here.

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,720
I hit it.

151
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay.

152
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,680
One step.

153
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,800
Go to your left.

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Go straight ahead.

155
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,240
Here.

156
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,040
Go straight ahead.

157
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,440
To your left.

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,280
Yes.

159
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
To your right.

160
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,560
Here.

161
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,720
Just follow this position.

162
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,880
Same position in front of me.

163
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
You called him something.

164
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,440
My Green is going to show me what H sine is.

165
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
You should go straight ahead here.

166
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,360
Yes.

167
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,600
You two shooting Minister,

168
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
you two shooting our Green will...

169
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,400
What are you looking at?

170
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,480
This direction is three.

171
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,120
The backup is the green one.

172
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
This is the green dish.

173
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,920
But I heard from my security guard Zhao Sier

174
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,400
The thief

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,960
is not very flexible

176
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
It's me

177
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,120
I'm not flexible

178
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,840
Next

179
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,480
We will conduct a flexibility test

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,240
The first person's toes must be aligned with the wall

181
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,560
The person behind has his toes on the ground

182
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,440
Each pair is longer than the other

183
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,080
OK

184
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,120
OK

185
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
It's the end

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
It's the end

187
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
What should we do?

188
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
What should we do?

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
Can you come over a little bit?

190
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I can't

191
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Chen Hongxin

192
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,880
It's over

193
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Chen Hongxin is fighting

194
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
This is not easy

195
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I can't

196
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
I can't

197
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I can't

198
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I can't

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
I can't

200
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
I can't

201
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
I can't

202
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I can't

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
This pants is going to be a horse

204
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
We are done

205
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,920
Are we straight?

206
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
You have to come over a little bit more

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,840
I come over again

208
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
No, this way

209
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
Come on, stop laughing

210
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Hurry up

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Hurry up

212
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,440
Stop laughing

213
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,720
It's shaking

214
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
But you have to hold it

215
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,400
You didn't stick it

216
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
OK

217
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
Wait, let me try again

218
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,200
OK

219
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
OK

220
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,720
Lanying can't get to this position

221
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,160
Your legs are long, I believe you

222
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
It's going to be a hard time

223
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Wait, let me measure first

224
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
how long they are

225
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
575 meters

226
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
575 meters

227
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
No, I can't

228
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I can't even fold three of them

229
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
It's mainly her butt

230
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
She is good

231
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
No, but my legs are short

232
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Three of you are 1.8 meters

233
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
and only 5.4 meters

234
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Isn't she only two shoes?

235
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I can't fold the shoes

236
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
I can't even fold the bottom of the shoes

237
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I think we should try to

238
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
make it more difficult for her

239
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
to get to the front

240
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I think we should try to

241
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
make it more difficult for her

242
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
to get to the front

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I think we should try to

244
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
make it more difficult for her

245
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I think we will definitely lose

246
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Impossible, why?

247
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Can you make it completely?

248
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I can

249
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Come on

250
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
She is using her hands to twist her shoes

251
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
What does it mean?

252
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I usually do this

253
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
She can do it in two tries

254
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Is it reasonable?

255
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
You can do this

256
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Your shoes are usually not on your feet

257
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Like this

258
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Your shoes

259
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Like this, make it a little bit more round

260
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
OK

261
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I admit defeat

262
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
I admit defeat

263
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Come on

264
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Here it comes

265
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
You wait for her to go down

266
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
It's over

267
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Come on

268
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm so happy

269
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
So happy

270
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
OK

271
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
OK

272
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Hurry up

273
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
OK, I'm going to hurry up

274
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
So long

275
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Come on

276
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Here it comes

277
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Are we done?

278
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Hurry up

279
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Hurry up

280
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
OK, get up

281
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Get up

282
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
It's done at a glance

283
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
She is so good at dancing

284
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Why don't you walk like this?

285
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
I usually

286
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
She can walk like this

287
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
I usually walk like this

288
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
She is trying her best

289
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
655

290
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
We are losers

291
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Losers

292
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
It's like this

293
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Your performance is very good

294
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I know what I'm thinking

295
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
I have two clues

296
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I'll give you two of them

297
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Protect her

298
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
We are the first clue

299
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Double coin, add a guarantee

300
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Loss of the money, lose three times

301
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
The teahouse is real

302
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
There must be something wrong with the boss

303
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
She added a guarantee to the double coin

304
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Loss of the money, lose three times

305
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
The thief is on the scene

306
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
The thief's jewelry is very special

307
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I think she stole it by herself

308
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
She set up the camera herself

309
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
She wants to get the three times

310
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Yes, she added a guarantee

311
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Then find someone

312
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Then get the money and steal it

313
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Yes

314
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
She added a guarantee

315
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
But we have to go to the teahouse

316
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Then we go to the teahouse first

317
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
So what are you?

318
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,840
The cross-generation large museum limited company

319
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
The judge, Chen Hongsheng

320
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
The assistant of the company, Chen Hongsheng

321
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
The assistant of the company, Chen Hongsheng

322
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
The assistant of the company, Chen Hongsheng

323
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,840
The company registration address, teahouse

324
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Is this a package company?

325
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
It's a business

326
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
The place of registration is a teahouse

327
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
It's possible

328
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Let's go to the teahouse first

329
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
We go to the teahouse

330
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
It's quite prosperous

331
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
We are in a big city

332
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
What is she giving her?

333
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
What are you doing?

334
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Did they steal something and run away?

335
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
They crossed the street

336
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
What did they just cross the street?

337
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
She ran over there

338
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Let's ask her for clues first

339
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
She must have something just now

340
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Tianxiang Teahouse

341
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Isn't that Zhao Si?

342
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Is that Zhao Si?

343
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Isn't that Zhao Si?

344
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Is that Zhao Si?

345
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
It's Zhao Si

346
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
The security guard that night

347
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Zhao Si was hit by a shield

348
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
and was knocked out

349
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Zhao Si

350
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
What are you doing? Zhao Si

351
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I'm drinking tea

352
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
The boss hasn't come down yet

353
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Why are you talking to Weiwei?

354
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840
No

355
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
You are a little nervous

356
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Who ran out of here just now?

357
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Did you give the jade to someone else?

358
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Liying and Waihe

359
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
No

360
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
What are you doing?

361
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Come here

362
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
I don't know anything

363
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
How dare you

364
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
You gave the double jade to someone else

365
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
What is the double jade?

366
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
You are from Boss Chen's house

367
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You don't know what the double jade is

368
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Pretend

369
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
He has a problem

370
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Pretend

371
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Can't I say it?

372
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I will tell you everything I know

373
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Isn't that Boss Chen

374
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
secretly recruiting some useful people

375
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
into their company?

376
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
The person who can steal the double jade

377
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
must have been recruited by him

378
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
But I don't think you six

379
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
know the situation

380
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Yes

381
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
But some of you look familiar

382
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Some of you

383
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Who?

384
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Just say it

385
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Who looks familiar?

386
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Didn't you see it just now?

387
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
No

388
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
It's the people in our company

389
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Do you know? So he looks familiar

390
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Stop him

391
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
I told you to stop him

392
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
I practiced

393
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
How dare you

394
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Forget it

395
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
How dare you

396
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Not smart

397
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
How dare you

398
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
He ran away

399
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Who?

400
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Little bastard

401
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
You are so noisy

402
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
What?

403
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Is it your place?

404
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
We are here to drink tea

405
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
One cup

406
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
How dare you

407
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
One cup

408
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
How dare you

409
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Don't you know who she is?

410
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Who?

411
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
She is Boss Chen's daughter

412
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Yes

413
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Boss Chen's daughter

414
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Yes

415
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
She is abroad

416
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
I just returned to China

417
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Who is her

418
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Son-in-law

419
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
How are you

420
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm fine, thank you

421
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
And you

422
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Teach me to drink tea

423
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Please sit down

424
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
What should I do if I have no money?

425
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
We have a talent

426
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
What talent?

427
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
He can do finger popping

428
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Do you want to learn?

429
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
His fingers are more flexible than my arms

430
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Yes

431
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
We have other talents

432
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
What else?

433
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I can act in front of the camera

434
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
in front of the camera

435
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
What a strange talent

436
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Let me see

437
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Awesome

438
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
This is not how you use your face

439
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,840
What did Yizha find?

440
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Yes, we are here to find clues

441
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Clues

442
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Yes

443
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
But

444
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Let's play first

445
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
OK

446
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
A big card

447
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
A big card

448
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
A mess

449
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
One for each person

450
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
One for each person

451
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
One for each person

452
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Very good

453
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
There is only one ghost in it

454
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Draw a card in turn

455
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
After drawing

456
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
There is a table

457
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Hit it

458
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
The last ghost card is in the hand

459
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
The loser will lose

460
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
What will happen if you lose

461
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Losers have punishment

462
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
According to the rules of my tea house

463
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
OK

464
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
What do you mean

465
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Draw a turtle

466
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Hit the table first

467
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Hit the table first

468
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
You are sending a card

469
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
What are you doing

470
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
It fell

471
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Let's start

472
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
What?

473
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Ignore it

474
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
There is a little trick

475
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
You want to play tricks

476
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
But

477
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
We are watching

478
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
This card

479
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Yes

480
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Wu Xie

481
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Wu Xie

482
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Little black dragon

483
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Little black dragon

484
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Little black dragon

485
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
I have remembered

486
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Where is your card

487
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Convert

488
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Would you like

489
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Please

490
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I will get it

491
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
But

492
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Say it

493
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Tell him

494
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
You can only law

495
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,760
But it's enough

496
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,480
Forget it

497
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,080
I won

498
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,960
I won

499
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
I won

500
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,080
Thanks
