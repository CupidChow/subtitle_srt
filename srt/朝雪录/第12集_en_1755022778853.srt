[Coroner's Diary]

2
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,900
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
That Sun Muqing

4
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,310
definitely came for the medical fairy.

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,280
As soon as he arrived in Jingzhou,
he asked everywhere for the medical fairy,

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
never mentioned Miss Qin.

7
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,490
It's just that

8
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,990
four hours isn't enough time

9
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,650
to get information
on the Medicine King Valley.

10
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,509
Master, please give me more time.

11
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,030
Let it go.

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,850
Stop investigating this matter for now.

13
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,030
The heir of the Marquis of Zhongyong,
Qin Yan, has already arrived in Jingzhou.

14
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,960
So soon?

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
By the way,

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,190
news from the capital.

17
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,120
The crown princess has been decided

18
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,160
as Qin Zhaoyu, the eldest daughter
of the Marquis of Zhongyong.

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,940
Qin Yan's purpose for this trip

20
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,300
is to escort the three Their Ladyships
back to the capital for the New Year.

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,490
Just the three Their Ladyships?

22
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:22,930
Yes.

23
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,910
If this was truly about family reunion
for the New Year,

24
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,430
why would they only bring back
the three unmarried maidens

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,230
and leave Third Madam and Qin Li alone
in Jingzhou?

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,430
Could it be that the Marquis of Zhongyong
intends to select one of the three maidens

27
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,260
to serve as concubine to the Crown Prince?

28
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,840
The Crown Prince has only just
taken his position,

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,430
and already the Marquis of Zhongyong
is rushing to use the Qin family maidens

30
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,790
to gain political favour.

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,030
If they want to return to the capital
for the New Year,

32
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,210
they must depart soon.

33
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,390
The further north they travel,
the colder it gets.

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,390
And if they encounter heavy snow,

35
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,650
the journey will be even more difficult.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,300
Your Highness,

37
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,680
Huo Huaixin requests to see you.

38
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,340
Your Highness is truly brilliant.

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,650
No wonder you let go of

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,870
the accountant from Qingyuan Pawnshop.

41
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,590
He indeed had hidden a ledger.

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,280
After obtaining the ledger, I investigated
through the night

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,630
and discovered that two families
in the Jingzhou Prefecture

44
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,160
are in collusion with them.

45
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,090
I immediately ordered Constable Qi
to arrest them.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,210
They really thought I was
just a figurehead prefect.

47
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,480
Hand over the ledger and the two families
to Bai Feng.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,260
Prefect Huo, you've made
a great achievement this time.

49
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,600
I will certainly report this truthfully
to His Majesty.

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
No, no.

51
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,520
It is Your Highness
who deserves the main credit.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,190
I merely ran some errands.

53
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,120
It's all thanks to
Your Highness's foresight

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,630
and Miss Qin's tremendous help.

55
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,800
Prefect Huo, how long will it take
to organize these files?

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,540
About half a month,

57
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,120
by which time Qin An's approval documents
should arrive.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,180
It must be completed within seven days.

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,850
Well...

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,590
If Prefect Huo can complete it
within seven days,

61
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,710
I'll credit you with the main achievement

62
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,710
for both cases.

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
No, I couldn't possibly.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,800
I will definitely complete it
within seven days,

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,860
I take my leave now.

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,350
Master,

67
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,680
there are still several months
until the year-end office closure.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,390
Why must it be completed
within seven days,

69
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,920
giving him such a great achievement
for free?

70
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,070
What do you think?

71
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,730
You want to return to the capital
with Miss Qin.

72
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,070
Keep watching the Marquis of Zhongyong

73
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,930
and report everything to me,
no matter how trivial.

74
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,070
Yes, sir.

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
What?

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,860
In just four days,

77
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,280
you'll be leaving?

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,270
What's wrong with
the Marquis of Zhongyong, Qin Shu?

79
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,600
Why is he becoming more and more confused?

80
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,080
Look at those families who secure favour
through marriage alliances,

81
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,740
how many of them can last long?

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,170
Just to flatter the Crown Prince,

83
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,120
he makes everyone's New Year
anything but peaceful.

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,190
Mother,

85
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,460
please don't say such things.

86
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,390
Wan is a sensible person,

87
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,830
and we're all family here,

88
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,530
what's wrong with speaking freely?

89
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,480
Grand Princess,

90
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,830
as you know,

91
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,010
with my temperament,

92
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,870
I can live comfortably anywhere.

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,010
Today,

94
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,700
I've come specifically
to bid you farewell.

95
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,830
Please don't worry,

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,510
there's no need to concern yourself
with me.

97
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,530
The capital

98
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,300
is a long journey away,

99
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,240
and,

100
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,270
the relationships there are complicated.

101
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,310
When you're over there,

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,190
without anyone who truly cares for you,

103
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,870
how could I not worry?

104
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,380
Once you've recovered,

105
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:52,409
you can come visit me in the capital.

106
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,240
Fuling.

107
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,800
Here's a prescription I've written
for you.

108
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,460
If you take your medicine on time
every day,

109
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,810
keep your spirits up,

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,070
and get some exercise,

111
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,130
your health will certainly improve.

112
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,350
Miss Qin has put in great effort.

113
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,910
Mother, please don't worry.

114
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,040
I'll go prepare some personal items
right away.

115
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,040
When you arrive in the capital,

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,950
you don't need to tiptoe around others.

117
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,280
With Miss Qin's abilities and character,

118
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,560
and the current situation
of the Qin family,

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,770
returning to the capital

120
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,030
will certainly offer better prospects.

121
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,120
Of all the men the Marquis of Zhongyong
approved of,

122
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,070
which one ever had a good future?

123
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,830
Wan, remember,

124
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,540
if your uncle tries to arrange
a careless marriage for you,

125
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,909
you must stand up for yourself.

126
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,980
Don't care about being filial.

127
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,420
If you truly encounter difficulties,

128
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,950
remember to have someone send word to me.

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,890
At the very least,

130
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,590
to the Emperor and
the Empress Dowager,

131
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,190
I still have some influence.

132
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you, Grand Princess.

133
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,050
Why must Little Wan'er leave?

134
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,720
She's my only friend.

135
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,170
What will I do if she leaves?

136
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,970
Ning,

137
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,800
you're being petulant again.

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,810
That's the main branch of the Qin family,

139
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,000
her own uncle.

140
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,580
We have no relation to them,

141
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,180
we have no say in this matter.

142
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,480
Grandma, Father, Mother,

143
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,070
I have something to say.

144
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,190
I...

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,920
I... I want to marry...

146
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Great Aunt, if you want to protect
Miss Qin,

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,900
it can be quite simple.

148
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,020
I have a solution.

149
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,710
What solution?

150
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,420
Great Aunt, Uncle and Aunt

151
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
treat Miss Qin like their own daughter,

152
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,159
why not have Uncle and Aunt

153
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,800
adopt Miss Qin as their daughter?

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,450
This way,

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,190
Great Aunt gains a granddaughter,

156
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,040
and the Marquis of Zhongyong

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,070
can't interfere with Miss Qin's marriage
anymore,

158
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,930
killing two birds with one stone.

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,990
Then Little Wan'er

160
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,390
would become my real sister, wouldn't she?

161
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,310
Well, Your Grace

162
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,800
and Madam,

163
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,390
what do you think?

164
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,870
Chi had already mentioned this to me,

165
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,060
and I'm certainly pleased with it.

166
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,830
Madam,

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
what's your opinion?

168
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,680
I agree as well.

169
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,830
Good.

170
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,260
Grand Princess.

171
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,120
Today, we'll do as I say.

172
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,070
We don't need to hold a grand banquet,

173
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,320
we'll just invite Prefect Huo

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,010
to witness this for all of us.

175
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,750
Tomorrow, Your Grace and Third Madam

176
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,500
will have an adopted daughter.

177
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,049
From now on,

178
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,020
I will have

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,470
another granddaughter.

180
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,470
Ning and Qing'er will have a new sister.

181
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,390
From now on,

182
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,590
your fortune and misfortune,
honor and disgrace

183
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,070
will be shared with the Marquis Mansion.

184
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,350
Thank you, Grand Princess.

185
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,720
Little Wan'er, this is wonderful!

186
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,980
From now on, you'll be my younger sister.

187
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,060
[Lin Courtyard]

188
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,280
Come here.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Everyone be careful.

190
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,610
[Take Wan as my adopted daughter]

191
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,730
Little Wan'er, call me sister

192
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,360
and I'll teach you
how to use this sleeve arrow.

193
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,680
What's with this "Little Wan'er"?

194
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
You

195
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,220
should call her

196
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,440
Fourth...

197
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,470
Sister.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,880
Yes.

199
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,440
Fourth Sister.

200
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,040
Thank you, Sister.

201
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,490
This child.

202
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,550
The brothers all gave her

203
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,720
inkstones,

204
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,980
medical books and other cultured items.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,570
Yet you, as her sister,

206
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,030
give her such a weapon.

207
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,660
What's wrong with that?

208
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,750
My Fourth Sister is destined
for great things.

209
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,000
She needs this kind of hidden weapon
for self-defence

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
to be properly equipped.

211
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,400
Ning is being thoughtful.

212
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,760
After all, Wan

213
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,530
is a delicate young woman.

214
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,640
Being alone outside,

215
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,320
she must learn ways to protect herself.

216
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,480
I, Ning, beg you, Grandma

217
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,550
and Mother, to be merciful

218
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,010
and allow me to accompany Wan
to the capital.

219
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,910
Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,480
Get up.

221
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm not being ridiculous.

222
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,910
Grandma, I'm making this request

223
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,370
firstly because Wan has
no personal guards.

224
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,150
If we encounter ordinary thieves,

225
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,990
with my skills,

226
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,650
I can fully ensure her safety.

227
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,670
Secondly,

228
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,350
I haven't been back to the capital
for ten years.

229
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
I wish...

230
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,070
I wish that before I get married,

231
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,810
I could go back there one more time.

232
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,260
You're a young lady,

233
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,630
you shouldn't be talking about marriage.

234
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,790
Mother,

235
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,960
you've already been arranging matches
for me in secret,

236
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
so why can't I speak of it?

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,830
Anyway,

238
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
if you don't agree,

239
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,040
I won't get married at all.

240
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,050
When Wan returns to the capital,

241
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,050
I will definitely

242
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,790
arrange personal guards

243
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,050
to protect her safety.

244
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,720
If you wish,

245
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,190
after you're married,

246
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,120
you can also return to the capital.

247
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,510
Mother,

248
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,170
please stop trying to fool me.

249
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,040
Grandma in her day

250
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,610
was also a heroine
who rode horses and wielded bows.

251
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,290
Why is it that
after she married Grandfather,

252
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,210
she never returned to the capital?

253
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,070
Was it because she didn't want to?

254
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,610
Have I spoiled you too much

255
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,790
that you think you can

256
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,990
speculate about your elders' affairs?

257
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,790
Let her be.

258
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,480
Mother.

259
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,550
This child...

260
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,290
I understand Ning's thoughts.

261
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,870
Let her accompany Wan.

262
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,180
After all,

263
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,630
after marriage,

264
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,240
the days of freedom will be gone.

265
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,810
Thank you, Grandma.

266
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,610
Grandma!

267
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,300
Grandma is the best.

268
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,390
Little Wan'er,

269
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
we can go to the capital together now.

270
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,790
That's wonderful!

271
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,910
Thank you, Grandma.

272
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,040
Thank you, Grandma.

273
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,780
That's great, Little Wan'er.

274
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,290
[Title Deed]

275
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:43,970
Come.

276
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,780
Grand Princess.

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
This is too valuable,

278
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
I can't accept it.

279
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
Call me Grandma.

280
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,420
Grandma.

281
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,550
These things

282
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,360
are for you to keep as security.

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,670
Remember,

284
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,740
when dealing with the Qin family,

285
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,540
don't mention

286
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,320
a single word about this.

287
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,320
When you're alone out there,

288
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,190
be careful at all times,

289
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,910
alright?

290
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,370
Thank you, Grandma.

291
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
How did Your Highness get in?

292
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,370
I learned it from Li,

293
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,960
to avoid prying eyes

294
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,620
and enter through the window.

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,100
Your Highness, sneaking into
a private home at night

296
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,160
is against the law.

297
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,930
There's a good reason for this.

298
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,430
Today I discovered

299
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,790
that Qingyuan Pawnshop

300
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,810
and the Jingzhou garrison's

301
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,810
deputy commander are in collusion.

302
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,190
That's why I rushed here from my post.

303
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,590
Did you catch anyone?

304
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
No,

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,260
the suspect heard rumours

306
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,600
and escaped beforehand.

307
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
But Bai Feng has gone to investigate.

308
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,660
Then why did Your Highness come back?

309
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,600
I had planned to leave with you,

310
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,000
but now it seems

311
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,190
I'll need to wait a few more days.

312
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,070
So,

313
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,390
I wonder if you'll leave with Qin Yan

314
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,510
or wait for me?

315
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,910
As a daughter of the Qin family,

316
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,610
I should go with Qin Yan,

317
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,320
to avoid gossip

318
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,550
and difficult explanations
to the Marquis of Zhongyong.

319
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,480
You have a point.

320
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,500
Since Qin Yan arrived,

321
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,840
I can't hold you back under the pretext
of formal matters.

322
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,250
This is the token of
the Prince Rui's Mansion.

323
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,770
Keep it for protection.

324
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,020
I can't accept such a valuable token.

325
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,140
Qin Yan has personal guards,

326
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,050
and Ladyship is returning to
the capital with me,

327
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,150
so nothing bad will happen.

328
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,530
If you encounter common bandits,

329
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,930
they can still handle it,

330
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,440
but if you meet corrupt officials,

331
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,200
this token will be more effective
than anything they have.

332
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,730
In winter, there are many refugees
in the north,

333
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,920
and there's no shortage of

334
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,730
corrupt officials who aid the wicked.

335
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,010
Just keep this token

336
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
as your talisman.

337
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,640
Then you...

338
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,420
How long will Your Highness
remain in Jingzhou?

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,790
Once I catch that traitor in the army,

340
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,920
I'll come after you.

341
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,369
Don't worry.

342
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,220
Your Highness is wise and capable.

343
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,470
I have no concerns.

344
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,880
May...

345
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
May I use your daybed?

346
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,840
You can't rest here!

347
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,260
I need to return to my post before dawn.

348
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,350
I'm too exhausted to go back
to the Marquis Mansion.

349
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,410
[Marquis of Anyang's Mansion]

350
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,490
Ning.

351
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,850
Look at you,

352
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,010
so reckless.

353
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,700
Dressed like this,

354
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,250
you hardly look like a lady
from a noble family.

355
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,680
I think Ning looks exceptionally spirited

356
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,810
dressed this way.

357
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Mother.

358
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,910
I'm now Little Wan'er's personal guard.

359
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,560
if I dress too elaborately,

360
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,640
it will slow down my sword-drawing speed.

361
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,580
All right.

362
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,000
Heroine Yue,

363
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,000
promise me,

364
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,130
on this journey,

365
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,370
you must be careful.

366
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,570
Mother,

367
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,540
Brother,

368
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,830
don't worry about me,

369
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,490
I'll take good care of myself.

370
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,950
I'm leaving now.

371
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,950
Take care of yourselves.

372
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,600
Take care.

373
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,330
Just make sure you protect yourself.

374
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,590
Xiang,

375
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,770
you must listen to Cousin Yan
on the journey,

376
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,900
and don't be wilful.

377
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,990
Shuang'er, remember this,

378
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,680
once you enter the Marquis Mansion,

379
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,240
you must know your place

380
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,720
and stop being as reckless

381
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,360
and troublesome as before.

382
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,640
Yes.

383
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,560
Your uncle

384
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,170
values rules above all else.

385
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,740
After you enter the Marquis Mansion,

386
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,860
you must behave properly

387
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,750
and never give anyone reason
to find fault with you.

388
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,950
Don't worry, Mother.

389
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,910
When I am at the capital,

390
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,330
I'll be the true lady
of the Marquis Mansion.

391
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,840
Let's see who dares to pick on me.

392
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,600
Xiang.

393
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,420
Steward Zhou.

394
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,410
-It’s a long journey.
-Xiang.

395
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,050
You absolutely must stop
being so competitive and stubborn.

396
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,860
Your eighth sister

397
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,680
is your aunt's precious darling.

398
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,490
After entering the Marquis Mansion,

399
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,970
you must control your temper

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,660
and be humble when necessary.

401
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,530
As long as you please your uncle and aunt,

402
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,690
your marriage prospects will be good.

403
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,870
I understand, Mother.

404
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,440
Aunt.

405
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
We've packed almost everything.

406
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
We can depart now.

407
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Thank you for your help, Yan.

408
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,940
Please don't worry.

409
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,750
I'll take full responsibility
for all three sisters' safety.

410
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,310
Good.

411
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,660
Bid farewell to Li.

412
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,650
I'll see you off.

413
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,480
Li.

414
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,910
I'm leaving now.

415
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,990
Wan.

416
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,230
Wan, I am useless.

417
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,940
This is all I've saved over the years.

418
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,830
Please don't think it's too little.

419
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,700
Li, what do you mean?

420
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,390
Qin Xiang has her mother's protection,

421
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,770
and even if Qin Shuang is deemed
not as outstanding,

422
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,500
she won't be treated too badly.

423
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,920
But you'll be alone in the capital.

424
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,040
Keep this money for emergencies.

425
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,990
Here.

426
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,240
This is enough.

427
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,980
Consider it payment
for my medical services.

428
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,720
Wan.

429
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,310
Li.

430
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,810
The third branch of the family
depends on you now.

431
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,910
Whether you're born of the main wife
or a concubine,

432
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,180
in my heart,

433
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,270
you will always be my second brother.

434
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,230
Wan.

435
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,350
I won't let you down.

436
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,040
I'm leaving now.

437
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,350
Father.

438
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,030
Mother.

439
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,200
I, your daughter, can finally go
to the capital as wished.

440
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,460
No matter how powerful

441
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,180
those who harmed you may be,

442
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,510
I will do everything in my power

443
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,530
to clear your names.

444
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,250
Your Ladyship, please drink.

445
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,190
You two, come with me.

446
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,200
It's not even winter months yet,

447
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,420
how can it be so cold?

448
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,910
Why did we have to abandon
the water route?

449
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,550
We can't even hire a carriage
in this backwater place.

450
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,720
Can we even reach the posthouse tonight?

451
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Just bear with it.

452
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,630
It gets colder as we go north,

453
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,560
and soon the canal will freeze over
and boats won't be able to pass.

454
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,040
Your Ladyship is so knowledgeable.

455
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,040
In such cold weather,

456
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,400
how much longer will Little Wan'er
stand there watching?

457
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,280
My Lady,

458
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,560
standing in the wind for too long
will make you catch cold.

459
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,510
Let's go inside.

460
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,200
These tea pastries

461
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,590
are our local specialty.

462
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,450
Ladies, please help yourselves.

463
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,830
Have some hot tea.

464
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,070
Little Wan'er, this is quite delicious,

465
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
try some quickly.

466
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,200
The Yunwu Mountain area is famous for tea.

467
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,860
These tea pastries truly have
a unique flavour.

468
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Your Ladyship, sisters,

469
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,510
we've finally found a carriage.

470
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,270
But it's already getting dark.

471
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,030
Tonight,

472
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,560
I'm afraid we'll need to
find lodging nearby.

473
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,820
Innkeeper,

474
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,780
is there an inn nearby where we can stay?

475
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,880
There's one up ahead.

476
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
Just follow the main road,

477
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,530
past Sanyuan Village and you'll reach it.

478
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,400
It's just that...

479
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,020
What is it?

480
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,590
It's just that in recent months,

481
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,400
Sanyuan Village hasn't been peaceful.

482
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,660
If you're going there,

483
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,070
you'd better leave soon.

484
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,210
It gets too dangerous after dark.

485
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,090
Innkeeper,

486
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,240
what happened in the Sanyuan Village?

487
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I've heard that

488
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,200
the village is haunted by monsters,

489
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,530
and they come out after dark
to eat people.

490
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,360
In broad daylight, how could there
be monsters?

491
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,750
Exactly. With me here,

492
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,430
we needn't fear any monsters.

493
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,980
The wise don't speak of
supernatural things.

494
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,060
Your Ladyship needn't believe such
hearsay from the backwoods.

495
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,460
The carriage is waiting at the entrance.

496
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,720
Your Ladyship and ladies, please get in.

497
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,570
Be careful, everyone.

498
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,510
Let's go.

499
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,640
Stop looking,

500
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,200
hurry up.

501
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,450
[Fortune Inn]

502
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Don't go!

503
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,130
Stop!

504
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,650
Wan,

505
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,350
we should leave.

506
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,920
In broad daylight, what monsters
could there be?

507
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,750
Exactly.

508
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,780
Besides, you have me here.

509
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,190
Little Wan'er, let's go.

510
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,750
Let's go.

511
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,800
Come on.

512
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,960
Distinguished guests from afar,

513
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,090
please come inside.

514
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,920
It looks like heavy snow will soon
block the mountain passes.

515
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,010
My place is the best option now.

516
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,030
The main rooms are the cleanest,

517
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,400
please rest assured.

518
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,450
Come, this way please.

519
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,520
Have some hot tea.

520
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,560
Come in.

521
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,510
Here.

522
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,790
Innkeeper, quickly prepare something,

523
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,000
everyone's starving.

524
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,860
Little Wan'er,

525
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,310
come, have some hot tea first.

526
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,310
Innkeeper,

527
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,710
why are there

528
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,660
garlic and animal horns hanging on
all the village doors?

529
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,740
What are they for?

530
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,990
Well...

531
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,450
My Lady, I'll wait outside.

532
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,650
We heard earlier

533
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,660
that this area has been troubled
by monsters.

534
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,440
Since you already know,

535
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,160
I won't hide it from you.

536
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,760
There used to be a large tea plantation
in the hills behind here

537
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,160
that was doing very well.

538
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,760
But about six months ago,

539
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,290
several people died one after another
at that plantation.

540
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,610
Young workers

541
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,090
mysteriously disappeared without a trace.

542
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,580
When their bodies were found,

543
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,830
all their organs had been removed.

544
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,720
It was a horrific way to die.

545
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,830
Could it have been

546
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,920
wild animals from the mountains?

547
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,480
The hunters practically turned
the Yunwu Mountain upside down,

548
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,320
but they didn't find any trace
of wild beasts.

549
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,790
With such a serious matter,

550
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,200
didn't the authorities investigate?

551
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,930
They did.

552
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,590
The officials investigated for months

553
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,680
but found nothing.

554
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,930
That's when rumours started

555
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,860
about a monster in the tea plantation
eating people.

556
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,600
But don't worry, distinguished guests,

557
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,140
since the plantation was shut down,

558
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,550
there haven't been any deaths
for over a month.

559
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,880
But we're not monsters.

560
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,070
Why are these villagers

561
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,000
looking at us with such hostility?

562
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,790
The villagers are ignorant.

563
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,550
They say too many outsiders
have been coming here,

564
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,580
bringing unclean things into the village

565
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,410
and causing all these troubles.

566
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,590
That's why

567
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,770
Sanyuan Village

568
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,080
has become what it is today.

569
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,710
Cui!

570
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,440
Cui!

571
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,350
Cui!

572
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,880
Ma'am.

573
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,270
My dear Cui!

574
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,820
-Be careful.
-Cui.

575
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,240
How can Grandma go on without you?

576
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,850
My poor Cui.

577
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,730
Wan.

578
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
Hurry! Everyone follow!

579
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,160
Cui, what happened to you?

580
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,880
Come.

581
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,480
Cui.

582
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,260
Careful now.

583
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,340
The Feng family line is finished.

584
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,440
What do you mean?

585
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,170
That old woman is Mrs. Feng
from the eastern village,

586
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,310
whose son and daughter were
killed by demons.

587
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,810
She only had one granddaughter left
to live with.

588
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,810
By the looks of it,

589
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,850
I pray

590
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,110
nothing happens to my inn.

591
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,160
Wan,

592
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,260
we cannot stay here long.

593
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,390
Make those outsiders get out!

594
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,540
-Get out!
-Yes!

595
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,310
Make those outsiders leave!

596
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,310
Get out!

597
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,670
How dare you, insolent peasants!

598
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,270
Stop this commotion at once!

599
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,030
Mr. Huang,

600
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,350
w-what are you doing?

601
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,280
Telling these outsiders to leave.

602
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,500
Our Sanyuan Village

603
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,240
finally had a few days of peace,

604
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,330
but as soon as these outsiders arrived,

605
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,790
Cui was met with disaster.

606
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,440
If these outsiders stay,

607
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,680
who knows who'll be next to die.

608
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,830
Make these outsiders
leave the Sanyuan Village territory,

609
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,270
Get out! Get out!

610
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,530
Everyone, attention!

611
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,940
Protect the women,

612
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,530
and arrest all these troublemakers.

613
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,810
What are you doing?

614
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,870
What are you doing?

615
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,830
We're not afraid of you!

616
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,240
Trying to bully us?

617
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,310
Make them leave!

618
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,880
Get out!

619
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,160
Leave now!

620
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,240
Cousin Yan, the locals here are fierce.

621
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,440
If a real conflict breaks out,

622
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,470
there will surely be casualties.

623
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,470
Don't worry, Wan.

624
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,270
These few troublemakers

625
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,160
are no match for
the Marquis Mansion guards.

626
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,620
Attack!

627
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,430
Don't!

628
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,240
Danger!

629
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,530
Stop!

630
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:07,490
Doctor Sun. Doctor Sun.

631
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,960
Doctor Sun.

632
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,020
Doctor Sun, what brings you here?

633
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,400
Senior was treating Mrs. Feng.

634
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,280
I heard the noise and rushed here.

635
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,530
With heavy snow coming,

636
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,660
driving people away now

637
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,170
is pushing them toward certain death,
isn't it?

638
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:22,820
But...

639
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,180
They can stay at Herbal Garden.

640
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,600
[Medicine King Valley, Sun Haoyue]

641
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,000
No, no!

642
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,400
-What if they bring you trouble?
-Don't worry.

643
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,110
They won't.

644
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,200
Senior.

645
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,030
Senior Sun.

646
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,070
-You may leave.
-Let me through.

647
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,930
Junior Sister!

648
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,630
What are you doing here?

649
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,240
Let...

650
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,310
Let me introduce.

651
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,000
This person here

652
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,070
is the legendary

653
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,350
Senior disciple from
the Medicine King Valley,

654
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,290
Sun Haoyue.

655
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,960
Greet him.

656
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,860
Qin Wan pays respects to Senior Brother.

657
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,790
Senior, this is our junior sister,

658
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,850
Qin Wan.

659
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,740
Since you completed your training and
left the mountain,

660
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,670
she's become Master's favourite.

661
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,970
Hello, Junior.

662
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,170
So you two

663
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,800
are Wan's seniors.

664
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,210
I am Wan's cousin, Qin Yan.

665
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,070
It's my pleasure today

666
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,410
to meet the two divine doctors from
Medicine King Valley

667
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,540
I'm truly honoured.

668
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,650
Young Master Qin.

669
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,110
Let's depart now.

670
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,700
Okay.

671
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,260
Where are we going?

672
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,830
We're going to Senior's Herbal Garden.

673
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,270
Since they won't let you stay here
anymore,

674
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,530
where else could we go?

675
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,830
[Herbal Garden]

676
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,480
Young Master, you're back.

677
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,960
Mr. Dong.

678
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,790
Let me take that.

679
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,630
How is my wife?

680
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
She's doing well.

681
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,150
These are my friends.

682
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,990
Please arrange accommodations for them.

683
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,060
I'll go check on her.

684
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,590
Alright.

685
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,190
Divine doctor?

686
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,740
He's being quite rude here.

687
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,490
Madam is seriously ill.

688
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,390
Young Master has always taken care of her
personally

689
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,720
and never delegates this duty to others.

690
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,310
He doesn't mean to slight you all.

691
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,440
Please understand.

692
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,560
Doctor Sun's devotion to his wife

693
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,690
is truly admirable.

694
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,780
This residence is quite spacious.

695
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,110
Please make yourselves at home

696
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,880
as if you were in your own house.

697
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,130
Don't stand on ceremony.

698
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:06,930
Thank you.

699
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,550
Come, please go inside.

700
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,239
This way, sir.

701
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,420
Junior.

702
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,960
Where's that Yan fellow?

703
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,320
How dare he let you enter the capital
alone?

704
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,429
Senior, you're talking nonsense again.

705
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,050
Lord Yan isn't my bodyguard.

706
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,320
What would it mean if he followed me
everywhere?

707
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,170
Let me tell you,

708
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,139
we're fortunate to have met Senior Haoyue
this time,

709
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,000
otherwise you all would be sleeping
on the streets.

710
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,159
So where is that Yan fellow?

711
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,230
Senior.

712
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,690
How did you know Senior Brother
lives here?

713
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Well, let me tell you,

714
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,520
after I left Jingzhou,

715
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,630
I heard about a compassionate doctor

716
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,830
named Doctor Sun at the Yunwu Mountain.

717
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,350
So I came to meet him.

718
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,330
And when we met,

719
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,730
guess who it was?

720
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,940
It was our Senior Haoyue!

721
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,580
Since he completed his training and left,

722
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,130
we haven't seen each other
for so many years.

723
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,990
This meeting

724
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,470
must be our fate.

725
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,480
The three of us

726
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,410
must have a good exchange of knowledge.

727
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:09,850
Okay.

728
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,410
Little Wan'er, hurry up!

729
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,280
Coming!

730
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,070
Let's go.

731
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm freezing to death!

732
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,030
Treatment prescription.

733
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,730
Ginkgo nuts.

734
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,290
Thank goodness your senior has
such a large house.

735
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,960
If I have to cramp together with your two

736
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
like I did on the boat,

737
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,170
I would really start cursing.

738
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,320
Though this place is a bit chilly,

739
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
the atmosphere is quite wonderful.

740
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,630
I heard your senior's wife isn't in
good health.

741
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,090
This place seems suitable for her recovery.

742
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,530
Isn't your senior a divine physician?

743
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,400
How come he can't even cure his own wife?

744
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,030
A great doctor isn't a deity,

745
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,110
some illnesses are beyond healing.

746
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,370
My Lady, Your Ladyship,

747
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,760
Mr. Dong has brought the bedding.

748
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,020
I'll go make your beds.

749
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,190
Fuling, just give me mine.

750
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,090
Here.

751
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
No, um...

752
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,710
Your Ladyship, let me make your bed.

753
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,360
No need,

754
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,090
just make Little Wan'er's bed.

755
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,040
Let's take a walk in the garden.

756
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,740
I don't want to.

757
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,130
I woke up way too early today,

758
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,740
I need to catch up on sleep.

759
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,670
There are no monsters in this world,

760
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,560
but the Feng family's granddaughter's arm

761
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,020
was dry as a withered bone.

762
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,750
There were no blood stains on the linen
nor wooden boards.

763
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,890
Clearly all blood was drained
from her body when she died.

764
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,950
How could any human possibly do this?

765
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,590
How long will Your Highness be delayed
in Jingzhou?

766
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,700
Once I catch that traitor in the army,

767
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,830
I'll come after you.

768
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,440
Don't worry.

769
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,030
With Lord Yan's help,

770
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,100
I will surely expose that monster's
true form.

771
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,160
But,

772
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,290
when will he arrive?

773
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,790
Master, would you like to rest
for a while?

774
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,600
No,

775
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,030
it's about to snow again,

776
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,490
and the horses won't run fast on
nowy paths,

777
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,730
making it even harder to catch up
with them.

778
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,170
But you've been riding all day.

779
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm not that delicate.

780
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,070
Miss Qin,

781
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,490
did I startle you?

782
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,140
This is Young Master's patient.

783
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,070
Why did the Senior lock the patient
in here?

784
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,400
This patient suffers from hysteria,

785
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,660
and often hurts others during episodes.

786
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,960
What's wrong with him?

787
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,980
He gets like this during an episode,

788
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,240
which is why Young Master kept him here
for treatment,

789
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,070
to prevent him from harming others
or himself.

790
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,900
Miss Qin,

791
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,780
please go somewhere else for now,

792
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,780
I need to give him his medicine.

793
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,780
Thank you for your trouble, Mr. Dong.

794
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,370
Senior, are you alright?

795
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I'm fine.

796
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,950
Were you going to meet Sister-in-Law?

797
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,550
-I haven’t...
-I know the way.

798
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,510
I'll take you there. Let's go.

799
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,070
Alright.

800
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,900
It's just ahead.

801
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,100
It's this way.

802
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,130
[Benevolent Heart]

803
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,640
Senior Brother.

804
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,050
Junior Brother. Little Junior Sister.

805
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,650
Greetings, Senior Brother.

806
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,060
This is my brother-in-law,

807
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,020
Bai Feijue.

808
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,570
Thank you, Senior Brother.

809
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,350
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bai.

810
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,220
Thank you for your help, Senior Brother.

811
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,360
Or else we wouldn't have a place to stay.

812
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,950
I, Qin Wan, am truly grateful.

813
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,950
Miss Qin, please don't be so formal.

814
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,410
There's no need for such formalities
between fellow disciples.

815
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,710
Though the Herbal Garden is modest,

816
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,180
it is spacious and open.

817
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,170
Junior Sister, feel free to look around.

818
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,380
Compared to the Medicine King Valley,

819
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,910
it has its own unique charm.

820
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,070
I heard your wife is unwell.

821
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,020
After I pay my respects to her,

822
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,330
I will certainly enjoy
exploring this place.

823
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,660
You're too kind, Junior Sister.

824
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,440
Feiyan, as the lady of the house,
should have been the one

825
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,750
to welcome you, Junior Sister.

826
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,260
Unfortunately, she's not feeling well.

827
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,350
So please forgive our poor hospitality.

828
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,850
You say there's no need for formalities,

829
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,710
yet you're the most formal of all.

830
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,780
Alright, take us to see your wife.

831
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,110
It's kind of you to think of Feiyan.

832
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:24,710
Well then,

833
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,580
follow me.

834
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,600
Please, come in.

835
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,830
Your sister-in-law suffers from insomnia
due to her illness.

836
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,520
She needs the Yunmeng Incense
I specially prepared for her

837
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,430
to fall asleep,

838
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,620
which most people cannot tolerate.

839
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,830
She just took her medicine and
fell asleep.

840
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,830
You can look at her

841
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,730
from here.

842
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,580
Alright.

843
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,970
Let's go back.
