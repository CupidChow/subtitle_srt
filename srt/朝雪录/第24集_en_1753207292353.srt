1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Hurry and microwave it for just 2 mins

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:14,920
No need to wait

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,000
valve this up

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,080
You've done your research

5
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,900
After all, we just did it Mukbang this video

6
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,020
Actually, he stands coldley

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
Wow, not here

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Could it switch over?

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,320
Flying

10
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Thank you, friend

11
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Hurry

12
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Anyone here?

13
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,820
Is this kitschi that Yi X grandautress prepared?

14
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,180
Don't beObnered by clothes

15
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,100
Wearing a god of beauty

16
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,020
Don't beanic

17
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,960
When did you get men?

18
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,100
Late

19
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,900
If you die today, who knows that I killed them?

20
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,980
You lied to me to kill me.

21
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,740
You're a lunatic.

22
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,540
When you seduced Young Master Yan with your heart,

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,340
you didn't expect this, right?

24
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,540
At this moment,

25
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,780
I will destroy all your shame and your existence.

26
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,500
And all your ignorance.

27
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,100
If you kill me,

28
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
how will Yan Chi treat you?

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,980
Kill me if you want.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm not afraid.

31
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,900
Princess.

32
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
Chase them.

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,100
Let's split up.

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Yes.

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I want to see them dead or alive.

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,900
Get them back.

37
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Yes.

38
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
Your Majesty.

39
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,500
You're here at the right time.

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,900
Did you bring the princess and the prince?

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Yes.

42
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,900
You're here at the right time.

43
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,500
Did you take the princes and princesses?

44
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,300
We've been going for more than an hour.

45
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
I wanted to let the prince

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,900
relieve your embarrassment of the wedding.

47
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,100
But he suggested that you go to the South Campus.

48
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
I wonder if the people of Yixing

49
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,300
are well-organized for the trip.

50
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,900
I'm sorry to trouble you.

51
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,500
You're not going to trouble me?

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,900
Your wedding almost ruined your father's

53
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,900
hard-working and long-term efforts in the northwest.

54
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,300
If they're not satisfied with this,

55
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,900
I can let them go to the North and the West.

56
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,100
They're not going to do it.

57
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
They're going on a trip.

58
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
It's a matter of security.

59
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,900
Do you have more people?

60
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
I wanted to send more people.

61
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,100
But the prince said they're enjoying the beautiful scenery.

62
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,500
As long as they're calm, it won't be dangerous.

63
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,900
He rejected my suggestion.

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,700
I've been very cautious when I was the prince.

65
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,300
If I take on a task, I'll think carefully.

66
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm afraid that I'll miss out on the duty of the crown prince.

67
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,100
But the crown prince Yan Che is quite clever.

68
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Qi.

69
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,100
I'm going to hunt the prince of the two countries in seven days.

70
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,900
Do you understand why I'm entrusting you with the security?

71
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Your Majesty, the state of our state is in contact with the north and the west.

72
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
If the prince of the two countries

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,700
makes a mistake in our state,

74
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm afraid that someone will use it and cause a dispute.

75
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,100
So the security of this hunt must not be damaged.

76
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,300
In case of being reported,

77
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,500
I've sent people to investigate all the people who came from the two countries.

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
And I've set up a security around the hunting ground and within a hundred miles of the square.

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,900
No outsiders are allowed to enter the hunting ground.

80
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,900
If you're so cautious,

81
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I can be relieved.

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,300
But you're hiding something from me.

83
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
What do you mean?

84
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Let's go.

85
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,700
a

86
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,200
It was或者

87
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,400
go

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
He comes out of a head lie

89
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
Yes

90
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
I read the memorials of the Yuzhou Prefecture House.

91
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,900
I found out that the case of the gold was finally solved.

92
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,500
It's not surprising that it was done by Lady Qin Jiu.

93
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,100
It's not just that.

94
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,300
The death of the daughter of the late Duke of Song,

95
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,500
Song Rou,

96
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,700
and the daughter of the Crown Prince,

97
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,500
who was personally killed by the tyrant,

98
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,900
were all done by Lady Qin Jiu.

99
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,500
I didn't expect that Lady Jiu's martial arts

100
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
was so powerful.

101
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,300
Since the trial,

102
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
have no longer seen any capable person.

104
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,300
It's said that the man of talent is the most important person.

105
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,100
Jiu Dingqing is the most important person.

106
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,900
But she is a woman.

107
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,700
It's a pity that if she is important,

108
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm afraid that the imperial censor will jump out and scold her for causing trouble.

109
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,100
Let alone making a fuss in the court,

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,900
she has to bear all kinds of rumors.

111
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm afraid that she won't be able to raise her head in the rest of her life.

112
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,100
I don't like these old rules.

113
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,500
Why can a woman only be trapped in her inner house and raise her child?

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Why can't a woman see the light?

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
I think it's because some people are greedy for vanity.

116
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,500
They're afraid that a woman with a lot of wealth will compete with her.

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
That's why they have this absurd saying.

118
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,700
I didn't expect that

119
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,500
you would say such a thing.

120
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,900
It seems that you care about Jiu Dingqing.

121
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,700
Are you not worried about her?

122
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,300
This has nothing to do with personal feelings.

123
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm talking about the palace rules.

124
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
Your Majesty,

125
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,100
the so-called great man is not a man of great wealth.

126
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
I beg you to disobey the law of the world.

127
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,700
Please allow Jiu Dingqing to be a poet

128
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
and serve the court.

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,700
If you agree,

130
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,100
I will continue to use the name of the woman in the name of the man

131
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,700
to make her serve the Ministry of Justice.

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,900
Is it a bit unfair to use her in secret?

133
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
From what I know about her,

134
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,100
she only knows how to dress and dance.

135
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,900
She doesn't care about the palace rules.

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,700
If Your Majesty can let her dress and dance,

137
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,300
she will be able to do it.

138
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,500
Then, in your eyes,

139
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,700
let her be a woman in the name of the man.

140
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,900
When the time comes,

141
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
I will give her a suitable position.

142
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,100
Thank you, Your Majesty. I will do my best.

143
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,700
I always appreciate the palace rules.

144
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,300
You are very fair.

145
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,300
Your Majesty, the guards from the Southern Courtyard will report

146
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,900
that the Crown Prince of the Northern State is missing.

147
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
What?

148
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,500
How could such a ridiculous thing happen?

149
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,700
Where is the Crown Prince? Where is the Prince of Cheng?

150
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
The Crown Prince is leading two guards to search together.

151
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
But it's too late.

152
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,500
If we don't strengthen our troops,

153
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
the Northern State will be in danger.

154
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,100
The Crown Prince's life will be in danger.

155
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,500
Qi Lang, listen to me.

156
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,100
Yes.

157
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,900
Take the guards to the Southern Courtyard.

158
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
We must find the Crown Prince.

159
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,500
I will be there at night.

160
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,900
I want to see him alive.

161
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
I want to see him dead.

162
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Yes.

163
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,100
What are you afraid of?

164
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Come on.

165
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,300
It's you.

166
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,500
You must have killed my brother.

167
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Don't you dare talk back to me.

168
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,300
I'm not afraid of you.

169
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,500
You've been following my brother.

170
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,300
Can't you just follow the path?

171
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,100
The bamboo forest in the Southern Courtyard

172
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
is not yours.

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,500
If you go there,

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
I can't go there either.

175
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Stop!

176
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
You...

177
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Stop!

178
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,700
Don't think that

179
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
you can get the Crown Princess

180
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
if something happens to my brother.

181
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm here.

182
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,900
You can't get her.

183
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Young Marshal Yan,

184
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,700
my brother is a Northern Warrior.

185
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,900
He's not a hero.

186
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,300
If someone did something wrong,

187
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,500
he would be killed.

188
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,900
Please investigate it.

189
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Brother.

190
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,900
I've searched.

191
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,300
No one is here.

192
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,300
Is there a bodyguard

193
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
around Yuan Hong?

194
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm Xu Chang.

195
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm in charge of protecting the Crown Prince.

196
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,700
The Crown Prince was hunting down

197
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Princess Yan Chen.

198
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
I stopped him from following her

199
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,700
and kept him away from me.

200
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,100
I was the one who caused the trouble.

201
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
I should be punished.

202
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
Don't worry.

203
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
Don't worry.

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
You shouldn't be punished.

205
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
You should be responsible for

206
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
protecting the Crown Prince.

207
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,900
What does it have to do with me?

208
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Brother.

209
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,300
Where is the bodyguard?

210
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,700
Why isn't the bodyguard here?

211
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,500
Prince Yi, Yan Li,

212
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,700
follow me to the mountain.

213
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
Take the bodyguard to find Yuan Hong.

214
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,900
His Majesty ordered that we should be on the alert.

215
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
We should be alert when we see people.

216
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,300
Okay.

217
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,100
I'll go with you.

218
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Me too.

219
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,700
The Fifth Prince and General Chang

220
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
should wait in the forest.

221
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Ask a bodyguard

222
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,100
who was a member of the Crown Prince to lead us.

223
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Let's go.

224
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Brother.

225
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,500
I didn't find anything.

226
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Master.

227
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Master.

228
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,300
Lady Jiu and the two guards

229
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
followed the bodyguard to the palace.

230
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
They are still not back yet.

231
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
What a bodyguard.

232
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
How dare he touch Wan Er?

233
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,700
He must be a ghost.

234
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Brother.

235
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Ni Er Xin and I will go to Lady Jiu first.

236
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
You should continue to search for the Crown Prince.

237
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Wan Er is not a person who just sits and waits.

238
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
You don't know her.

239
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
It's easy to ignore her ways of saving herself.

240
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Chang Feng?

241
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
This is the Crown Prince's instrument, Chang Feng.

242
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,700
He's injured.

243
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Young Master Yan.

244
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,300
Chang Feng will never leave his master alone.

245
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,900
Something must have happened to the Crown Prince.

246
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Please save our Crown Prince.

247
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Brother.

248
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Brother.

249
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
What is this?

250
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,720
This is the leaves of the

251
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Qian Shi tree.

252
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,100
The leaves of the Qian Shi tree grow in the pond.

253
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
It means that Chang Feng

254
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,700
is struggling in the pond.

255
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
Wan Er is a spirit.

256
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
She can predict danger.

257
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Chang Feng is willing to take risks to enter the pond.

258
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,700
It must be to save the Queen.

259
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,100
The map of the South Campus.

260
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Here.

261
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Here.

262
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
And here.

263
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,100
These are the pond's leaves near the South Campus.

264
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Choose a path to buy a single-seater.

265
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,300
If you find a layer of the mountain wall,

266
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
that's right.

267
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
I understand.

268
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Brother, don't worry.

269
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
No matter if he's alive or not,

270
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,100
we will find the Crown Prince.

271
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Brother.

272
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,500
I'll go with you to find Wan Er.

273
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
Stay here.

274
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,100
If Yuan Wu comes back,

275
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,500
take her down.

276
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I know.

277
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,300
I will never let her go.

278
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Let's go.

279
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Let's go.

280
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Let's go.

281
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Let's go.

282
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Let's go.

283
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Keep looking over there.

284
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Chase them.

285
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Yuan Zhi.

286
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,100
I believe

287
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
you will find me.

288
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
This is near the pond.

289
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Search carefully.

290
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Yes.

291
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
The pond is the most dangerous.

292
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
If Yuan Hong really enters the pond,

293
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm afraid that he will die.

294
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I will not let him go.

295
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I will not let him go.

296
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
I will not let him go.

297
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
If Yuan Hong is alive,

298
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
I'm afraid that he will die.

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
If he has to,

300
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
who will hide in the pond?

301
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Someone must have done something.

302
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
He must have seen that the Crown Prince

303
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
was responsible for killing Yuan Hong.

304
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Maybe he just wants to kill them.

305
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Or he wants to

306
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
make the border of the Great Zhou and the Northern State

307
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
to be re-established.

308
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
He wants to kill them both.

309
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
No matter what the purpose of this person is,

310
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
he will involve the Crown Prince

311
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
if he kills Yuan Hong.

312
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
What's the difference?

313
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
That's a big difference.

314
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
If he just wants to kill the Crown Prince,

315
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
he is the one who is

316
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
greedy for the throne of our Great Zhou.

317
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,100
If he wants to

318
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
make the Great Zhou and the Northern State

319
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
to be re-established,

320
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
he is probably

321
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
the one who did it.

322
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
If he wants to

323
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
get the Western Han

324
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,100
into the country,

325
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
then his ambition

326
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
will be over.

327
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Changfeng,

328
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
why don't you go?

329
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Changfeng.

330
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Changfeng.

331
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Follow me.

332
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
This way.

333
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Hurry up and save them.

334
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Yes.

335
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
Changfeng.

336
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Changfeng.

337
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Changfeng.

338
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
You're awake.

339
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Here.

340
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Try this onion soup.

341
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
It's a little cold.

342
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I was so scared

343
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
when I saw you pass out.

344
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm lucky that Yan Shaoshuai is smart.

345
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
I didn't die in a big trouble.

346
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
You're not afraid that I can't find you?

347
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
I never thought that you can't find me.

348
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
But I'm afraid that I can't find you.

349
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm even more afraid that

350
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
it's too late

351
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
when I find you.

352
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,100
I know that you've written a wish

353
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,100
in my world.

354
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
The day you gave me

355
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,100
will be in the future.

356
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
When I hold you,

357
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I swear that

358
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I love you more.

359
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Let me see if it's the right size.

360
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
When I hold you,

361
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
I swear that

362
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
I love you more.

363
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I didn't expect that you can do this.

364
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Wild ducks are always on the battlefield.

365
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
This is a must-have skill.

366
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
This pair is a little better.

367
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
Here.

368
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Report!

370
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Your Highness,

371
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Crown Prince Yuanhong has been found.

372
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
But he's seriously injured.

373
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Send the ninth wife back to the mansion.

374
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I'll be right there.

375
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Yes.

376
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
He's seriously injured?

377
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
I'll go with you.

378
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
But your leg...

379
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Don't worry.

380
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm fine now.

381
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Besides, you're here.

382
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
The hundred princes are seriously injured in my country.

383
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I can't just stand by.

384
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Go.

385
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Yes.

386
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
My brother hasn't been found yet.

387
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Why don't you go out and look for him?

388
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Are you trying to kill my brother

389
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
on purpose?

390
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Tell your brother

391
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
that if he can't come back alive,

392
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
I'll report to my father

393
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
and lead the troops to the south

394
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
to pacify your state.

395
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Okay.

396
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Our Shuoxi Army is waiting for you.

397
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Why are you...

398
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
Why am I still alive?

399
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
You should be glad that I'm still alive.

400
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll kill you!

401
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Young Marshal,

402
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
the imperial family was distracted

403
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
because of the disappearance of the Crown Prince.

404
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Please don't mind.

405
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
If the Crown Prince can't come back alive,

406
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
I'll do my best!

407
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
You don't have to do your best.

408
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Save him.

409
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Crown Prince!

410
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
What are you doing?

411
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm going to kill him.

412
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Go.

413
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Go.

414
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Go.

415
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Crown Prince!

416
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Crown Prince!

417
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Crown Prince!

418
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Be gentle.

419
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
If you keep pressing him,

420
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
he'll die.

421
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Please save him.

422
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
The wound on the Crown Prince's chest

423
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
was caused by a sword.

424
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Although the wound was removed,

425
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
the sword still remains in his body.

426
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
The first step to heal the Crown Prince

427
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,100
is to take out the sword.

428
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Not to mention that the Crown Prince

429
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
has been bleeding too much

430
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
and can't stand the pain.

431
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Even if he's just injured,

432
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,100
no one would dare to take out the sword

433
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
and take out the sword.

434
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
You're all useless.

435
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
You said you couldn't save the Crown Prince.

436
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
You should go and apologize to Father.

437
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Hurry.

438
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Even if Yuan Hong dies here,

439
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
it will take time for the news to reach the country.

440
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
We can send the Shuo Xi Army early

441
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
to prepare for the North Dai

442
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
and the war.

443
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,100
What's the point of this, Brother?

444
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,100
You know nothing but fighting and killing.

445
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,100
But this was the Crown Prince's doing.

446
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
I'm just worried that

447
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
if Yuan Hong is seriously injured,

448
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
the consequences will be severe.

449
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
You should make a plan

450
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,100
to prevent the country from falling into a passive state.

451
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Brother, you've misunderstood my good intentions.

452
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
We should go now.

453
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Madam,

454
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,100
I've finished preparing the soup and the anesthetic.

455
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
Please wait for a moment.

456
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
I'll go get the sword.

457
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Yes, Madam.

458
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
I'll go get the sword.

459
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I'll go get the sword.

460
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Yuan Hong has taken the medicine.

461
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
He'll start pulling out the sword when the anesthetic works.

462
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
This is the Shou Er I found in his hair.

463
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
The area was cleaned up

464
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
because of Tan Yuan's visit.

465
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
How can there be hunters

466
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
who come in and spread Shou Er?

467
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
The Shou Er should not have been

468
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
placed on the place where he was put.

469
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Someone must have put the Shou Er

470
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
into his hair.

471
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
That's why it's here.

472
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Someone wants to destroy the world

473
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
with the beast's secret stone.

474
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Isn't this Gu Sha?

475
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
He's so mean.

476
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
But I still don't know.

477
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Aren't you guys enjoying the flowers together?

478
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
How can Yuan Hong be alone?

479
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Isn't it because of the snow fox

480
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
that's in the West Han County?

481
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Princess, look.

482
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Is it hot?

483
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
It ran away.

484
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
It's really a wild beast.

485
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
I'll catch it for you

486
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
and punish it well.

487
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Get ready.

488
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Be careful, Your Highness.

489
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
The snow fox is crazy?

490
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
What's wrong?

491
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
It stinks.

492
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
I just held it for a moment.

493
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
It won't be on me, will it?

494
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
I see.

495
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Yuan Hong went after the snow fox.

496
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
But he didn't expect that the murderer

497
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
would have a chance.

498
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
After the murderer hurt Yuan Hong,

499
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
he used the beast's secret stone

500
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
to lure the beast to destroy the world.

501
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
A person who can use such a cruel trick

502
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
will not give up easily.

503
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
As long as Yuan Hong is alive,

504
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
he will be in danger.

505
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Only when we catch the real murderer,

506
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
will Yuan Hong be safe

507
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
and the border will be peaceful.

508
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Leave it to us.

509
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Do your best to save Yuan Hong.

510
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
I'll go and have a look.

511
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Yuan Ning, keep an eye on Yuan Wu.

512
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Bai Feng, keep an eye on this place.

513
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
I...

514
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Yan Li, take me to the place

515
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
where you found Yuan Hong.

516
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Okay.

517
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
I found it here.

518
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Go up and have a look.

519
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
It's me.

520
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
It's me.

521
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Brother, this is Ma Tian Yi.

522
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Yan Li.

523
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Ban Ma Suo?

524
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Someone wants to kill Yuan Hong.

525
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Do you have any suspects?

526
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
According to the investigation,

527
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
I have a suspect.

528
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
But there is still not enough evidence.

529
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Everyone has the risk of treason.

530
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
No matter who the killer is,

531
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
if this happens,

532
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
the murderer will be killed.

533
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I'm sure.

534
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
I'm sure.

535
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
I'm sure.

536
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I'm sure.

537
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
I'm sure.

538
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
I'm sure.

539
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
I'm sure.

540
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
I'm sure.

541
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
I'm sure.

542
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
I'm sure.

543
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
I'm sure.

544
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
I'm sure.

545
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
This happened in front of my court.

546
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
It's a matter of the two countries' diplomatic relations.

547
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
We should act cautiously.

548
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
But the longer the delay,

549
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
the more dangerous Yuan Hong will be.

550
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I...

551
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
I have a way to catch the murderer.

552
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Please allow me.

553
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
You can't hurt anyone easily.

554
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Are you going to agree?

555
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,820
but still

556
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,740
I continue side by side

557
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,840
Thanks for the interview

558
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,420
Can I get a Meiji monster no?

559
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Other than me

560
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
If Hardcore, that is possible

561
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Nice

562
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,960
Hàs dÓ the two потless

563
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,540
Usually treated painfully

564
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,700
't better

565
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,900
not

566
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:57,740
Lee Hulim's

567
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
I'll kill you!

568
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
You want to die?

569
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
It's not that easy in front of me.

570
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,640
Please allow us to have a while.

571
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,840
Quite opportunity to make othersak retrograde.

572
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:18,100
Come on, size

573
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,340
You're afraid that Xue Hu will be scared and run away, right?

574
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,540
What are you doing?

575
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,940
You deliberately put the scent of wolf-hawks

576
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,380
on Princess Yong Ning.

577
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,540
Wolf-hawks can't stand the heat.

578
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,140
Is it hot?

579
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,380
You use the scent of wolf-hawks

580
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,740
to stimulate the wind of the snow-wool.

581
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,300
He's running away.

582
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,100
To catch up with the Crown Prince

583
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,700
and take the opportunity to attack.

584
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,180
Xu Chang.

585
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,460
I heard that you are very proud and have many enemies.

586
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,420
You can get to where you are today

587
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,340
all thanks to the promotion of Yuan Hong.

588
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,220
Tell me.

589
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
Why did you kill him?

590
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,060
Tell me.

591
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,380
Who did you kill?

592
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,620
Brother.

593
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,420
Are you okay?

594
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Brother.

595
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,140
Are you okay?

596
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,660
Brother.

597
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
Yuan Hong.

598
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,860
Don't be so polite.

599
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
Don't be so polite.

600
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,340
General Xu.

601
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,940
I want to ask you a question.

602
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,260
Why did you kill me?

603
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,100
You were so cruel

604
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,500
and even tried to poison my medicine.

605
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,060
Xu Chang.

606
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,020
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

607
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,060
I deserve to die.

608
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,620
I...

609
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,580
I have nothing to say.

610
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Yuan Hong.

611
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,380
I have a report to make.

612
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,620
Before you were cured,

613
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,940
Xu Chang was already

614
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,980
buried by someone who was powerful and powerful.

615
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,940
If he becomes the Crown Prince,

616
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,980
he can get a great credit.

617
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,940
Am I right?

618
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,740
Prince V.

619
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,820
I don't understand what you're talking about.

620
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,620
To cover up your crime,

621
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,740
you can put the beast on the dead Crown Prince Yuan Hong.

622
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,740
I have to eat it because of the beast.

623
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Mother.

624
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Is it really you?

625
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
Anrui.

626
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,860
Tell me.

627
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Tell me.

628
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Tell me.

629
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Tell me.

630
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Tell me.

631
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Tell me.

632
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Tell me.

633
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
Tell me.

634
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Tell me.

635
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Tell me.

636
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,940
Tell me.

637
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Tell me.

638
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Tell me.

639
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Anrui.

640
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
Tell me.

641
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Why?

642
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,660
Why did you do this?

643
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,060
To be the Crown Prince.

644
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,540
If you weren't so stupid and useless,

645
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,660
you wouldn't have been able to get Yan Chi and Qin Wan.

646
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Yuan Hong would have been dead by now.

647
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,340
Shameless.

648
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
Anrui.

649
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,940
I've been your brother for so many years.

650
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,540
I didn't expect you to be such a

651
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,940
fake and evil person.

652
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,740
If you weren't so stupid and useless,

653
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,340
I wouldn't have lost my land

654
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
in the hands of the Shuoxi Army.

655
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,140
If the imperial flag wasn't useless,

656
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,940
how could I not be able to get the Shuoxi Army and Yan Chi?

657
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
I wanted to be a good emperor,

658
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,940
but I couldn't be the emperor if I was a good brother.

659
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Since then, the one who is superior to the emperor should be superior to the emperor.

660
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,140
That's how it should be.

661
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,940
You're too high-minded.

662
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,940
You're not loyal to the country,

663
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,340
you're not good at military service,

664
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,140
and you're not good at the people.

665
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,740
You can't let the people of the court live in peace.

666
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,140
What's the use of killing a hundred Crown Princes?

667
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,340
You're just a fake and evil person

668
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,340
who is trying to change the country's mind

669
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,740
for your greed and unyielding action.

670
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Enough!

671
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,940
Take Yuan Hong and Yan Chi to the capital.

672
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,940
I'll take care of the people.

673
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,540
Yuan Hong, Yan Chi, and Xu Chang,

674
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
take them back to the Dali Temple.

675
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Yes, sir.

676
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
You're not worthy of being the Crown Prince.

677
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:33,940
I'll personally write a letter to the North Korean army.

678
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,340
Although the North Korean army is in a bad state,

679
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,540
it's a good thing that the news has come out.

680
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,540
You don't have to be too careful.

681
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,540
This is about the state affairs of the North.

682
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,740
I can't take the throne.

683
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,540
When you're fully recovered,

684
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,740
you can ask the North to forgive you.

685
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,140
I thank you, Your Majesty.

686
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,940
I'm so ashamed of what you said.

687
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,740
After what happened,

688
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,740
I have no right to take the throne.

689
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:17,540
I'll do my best to make the country a better place.

690
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,140
I hope that the two countries will be together

691
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,940
and the country will be at peace.

692
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,340
That's good.

693
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,940
Come on, take Yuan Hong and the Crown Prince to rest.

694
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,740
Everyone else, leave.

695
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,940
Li and Qi, stay here.

696
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,340
The North's war against the Crown Prince has been intensified.

697
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,940
I feel very uneasy.

698
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,540
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

699
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,740
Brother Qi and I don't want to be the Crown Prince.

700
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,540
We can't be the Crown Prince.

701
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,740
We'll have to wait for another trial.

702
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,540
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

703
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,740
Liu Yun has given the order.

704
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,540
He said that he's not feeling well.

705
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,940
He's already gone to West Han.

706
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,740
He doesn't want to be the Crown Prince?

707
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,940
The Crown Prince of West Han is a smart man.

708
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,340
He was going to stabilize the border of the three countries.

709
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
Now, the North's internal forces are no longer needed.

710
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,940
It's a good thing.

711
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,140
It's good for the Crown Prince.

712
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,140
It's a good thing that Qin Jiu Niang saved the Crown Prince's life.

713
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,340
And she helped us capture the real murderer.

714
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,740
She has done a lot of great work.

715
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,940
I don't know what to give her.

716
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,540
It's not easy.

717
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,940
Your Majesty gave her the gold and silver jewelry.

718
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,140
Give her a gift this time.

719
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,340
I've never been close to you.

720
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,740
I'm not the Crown Prince.

721
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Why are you here to see me off?

722
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm here to see you off.

723
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,340
I'm here to have fun.

724
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,740
I'm here to make sure you don't harm the Fifth Princess.

725
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,740
I wasn't happy before.

726
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,940
When I was chasing Yuan Hong,

727
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,740
I thought about how I should treat you.

728
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,940
When I was chasing Yuan Hong,

729
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,140
I thought about how I should use the North's sword to shoot him.

730
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,340
And then I'll give it to them.

731
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,940
But I didn't expect that they would have a backer.

732
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,340
And I was defeated by the power of the Prince.

733
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,340
You're trying to do the opposite.

734
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,540
It's because you're trying to cover up the trouble.

735
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,940
You really don't want me to treat you.

736
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,540
I can give you three to five years.

737
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,340
How much pain do you have to suffer to live for three to five years?

738
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,540
It's not worth it.

739
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,140
Now Yuan Hong is seriously injured.

740
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,540
The North's sword will be out of use for many years.

741
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,540
I can breathe again.

742
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,140
Thank you for your kindness.

743
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
Let me go.

744
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,940
You're welcome.

745
